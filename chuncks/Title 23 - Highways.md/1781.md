Axles must be those designed for the width of the body. All braking systems must comply with State and Federal requirements. A brake force limiting valve, sometimes called a "slippery road" valve, may be provided on the steering axle. Mud flaps or splash guards are required. When traveling on a smooth, paved surface, trailers must follow in the path of the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side when the towing vehicle is moving in a straight line.
