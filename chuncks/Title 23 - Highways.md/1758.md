(5)(i) A beverage semitrailer is specialized equipment if it has an upper coupler plate that extends beyond the front of the semitrailer, but not beyond its swing radius, as measured from the center line of the kingpin to a front corner of the semitrailer, which cannot be used for carrying cargo other than the structure of the semitrailer, and with the center line of the kingpin not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer (exclusive of rear-mounted devices not measured in determining semitrailer length). No State shall impose an overall length limit on such vehicles when operating in a truck tractor-beverage semitrailer or truck tractor-beverage semitrailer-beverage trailer combination on the NN.

(ii) The beverage trailer referred to in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section means a beverage semitrailer and converter dolly. Converter dolly has the same meaning as in 49 CFR 393.5.

(iii) Truck tractor-beverage semitrailer combinations shall have the same access to points of loading and unloading as 28-foot semitrailers (28.5-foot where allowed by ยง 658.13) in 23 CFR 658.19.
