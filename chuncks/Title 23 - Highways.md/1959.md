###### VEHICLE:

Trailing units must be of reasonably uniform in length. The overall length of the combination is limited to 105 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.

ROUTES: The following NN routes are also open to truck tractor and three trailing unit combinations.

LEGAL CITATIONS: Same as the OR-TT2 combination.
