###### Power level.

(d)(1) DCFC charging ports must support output voltages between 250 volts DC and 920 volts DC. DCFCs located along and designed to serve users of designated AFCs must have a continuous power delivery rating of at least 150 kilowatt (kW) and supply power according to an EV's power delivery request up to 150 kW, simultaneously from each charging port at a charging station. These corridor-serving DCFC charging stations may conduct power sharing so long as each charging port continues to meet an EV's request for power up to 150 kW.

(2) Each AC Level 2 charging port must have a continuous power delivery rating of at least 6 kW and the charging station must be capable of providing at least 6 kW per port simultaneously across all AC ports. AC Level 2 chargers may conduct power sharing and/or participate in smart charge management programs so long as each charging port continues to meet an EV's demand for power up to 6 kW, unless the EV charging customer consents to accepting a lower power level.
