###### Weight:

For all combinations, the maximum gross weight on two or more consecutive axles is limited by the Federal Bridge Formula but cannot exceed 129,000 pounds. The weight on single axles or tandem axles spaced 40 inches or less apart may not exceed 20,000 pounds. Tandem axles spaced more than 40 inches but 96 inches or less may not exceed 34,000 pounds. Two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and last axles of the tandems is 36 feet or more. The weight on the steering axle may not exceed 600 pounds per inch of tire width.

For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 feet the following additional regulations also apply. The weight on all axles (other than the steering axle) may not exceed 500 pounds per inch of tire width. Lift axles and belly axles are not considered load-carrying axles and will not count when determining allowable vehicle weight.
