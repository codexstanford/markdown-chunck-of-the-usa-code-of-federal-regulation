###### Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 470 - Guidance Criteria for Evaluating Requests for Modifications to the National Highway System

Section 103(b), of title 23, U.S.C., allows the States to propose modifications to the National Highway System (NHS) and authorizes the Secretary to approve such modifications provided that they meet the criteria established for the NHS and enhance the characteristics of the NHS. In proposing modifications under 23 U.S.C. 103(b), the States must cooperate with local and regional officials. In urbanized areas, the local officials must act through the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) designated for such areas under 23 U.S.C. 134. The following guidance criteria should be used by the States to develop proposed modifications to the NHS.

1. Proposed additions to the NHS should be included in either an adopted State or metropolitan transportation plan or program.

2. Proposed additions should connect at each end with other routes on the NHS or serve a major traffic generator.

3. Proposals should be developed in consultation with local and regional officials.
