####### Positive Protection Devices.

(a)The need for longitudinal traffic barrier and other positive protection devices shall be based on an engineering study. The engineering study may be used to develop positive protection guidelines for the agency, or to determine the measures to be applied on an individual project. The engineering study should be based on consideration of the factors and characteristics described in section 630.1106(b). At a minimum, positive protection devices shall be considered in work zone situations that place workers at increased risk from motorized traffic, and where positive protection devices offer the highest potential for increased safety for workers and road users, such as:

(1) Work zones that provide workers no means of escape from motorized traffic (e.g., tunnels, bridges, etc.);

(2) Long duration work zones (e.g., two weeks or more) resulting in substantial worker exposure to motorized traffic;

(3) Projects with high anticipated operating speeds (e.g., 45 mph or greater), especially when combined with high traffic volumes;

(4) Work operations that place workers close to travel lanes open to traffic; and

(5) Roadside hazards, such as drop-offs or unfinished bridge decks, that will remain in place overnight or longer.
