For two trailing unit combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 65 feet and not involved in carrying seasonally harvested products, access to and from I-80 is limited to designated staging areas within six miles of the route between the Wyoming State Line and Exit 440 (Nebraska Highway 50); and except for weather, emergency, and repair, cannot reenter I-80 after exiting.

ROUTES: Except for length permits issued to carriers hauling seasonally harvested products in combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 65 feet but not more than 71.5 feet which may use all non-Interstate NN routes, vehicles requiring length permits are restricted to Interstate 80 between the Wyoming State Line and Exit 440 (Nebraska Highway 50). Combinations not requiring length permits may use all NN routes.
