###### VEHICLE:

The truck or trailer may be up to 40 feet long not to exceed 75 feet overall. The truck may have a built-in hoist to load cargo. Any towed vehicle in a combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.
