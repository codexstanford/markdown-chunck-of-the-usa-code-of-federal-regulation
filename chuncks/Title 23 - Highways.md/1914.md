#### PART 658 - TRUCK SIZE AND WEIGHT, ROUTE DESIGNATIONS - LENGTH, WIDTH AND WEIGHT LIMITATIONS
##### Appendix C to Part 658 - Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate System and Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network
###### PERMITS:

Same as the NV-TT2 combination, except permits for Truck-trailer, or Truck-trailer-trailer combinations are only required when the overall length is 70 feet or more.

ROUTES: Same as the NV-TT2 combination.

LEGAL CITATIONS: Same as the NV-TT2 combination.

OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The cargo-carrying length restriction does not apply to this combination. The length of each trailing unit is limited to 28.5 feet. This describes a two trailing unit vehicle whose operation is guaranteed by the STAA of 1982 regardless of inter-unit spacing. As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying length is not restricted. This combination is listed as a LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established in the Congressional definition. The 86,400-pound gross weight limit is grandfathered for New Mexico.
