Annual blanket overdimension permits are issued to allow a truck tractor and two trailing units legally operating in Kansas, Nebraska, or Oklahoma to move to and from terminals in Missouri which are located within a 20-mile band of the State Line for these three States. There is a permit fee per power unit. The permits carry routine permit restrictions, but do not address driver qualifications or any other restrictions not included in the rules and regulations for all permitted movement.
