####### State Highway Agency Affirmative Action Officer (internal).,Appointment of Affirmative Action Officer.

A.1.The head of the SHA should appoint a qualified Affirmative Action (AA) Officer (Internal EEO Officer) with responsibility and authority to implement the internal EEO program. In making the selection, the following factors should be considered:

a. The person appointed should have proven ability to accomplish major program goals.

b. Managing the internal EEO program requires a major time commitment; it cannot be added on to an existing full-time job.

c. Appointing qualified minority and/or female employees to head or staff the program may offer good role models for present and potential employees and add credibility to the programs involved. However, the most essential requirements for such position(s) are sensitivity to varied ways in which discrimination limits job opportunities, commitment to program goals and sufficient status and ability to work with others in the agency to achieve them.
