###### VEHICLE:

The rules provide that all CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units (except for truck-trailer combinations which are limited to an 85-foot combination length) are subject to calculated maximum off-tracking (CMOT) limits. The CMOT formula is:

The power unit of LCV's and extra-length combinations shall have adequate power and traction to maintain a speed of 15 miles per hour under normal operating conditions on any up-grade over which the combination is operated.

Fifth-wheel, drawbar, and other coupling devices shall be as specified by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, section 393.70.

Every combination operated under special permit authority shall be covered by insurance meeting State and Federal requirements. Evidence of this insurance must be carried in the permitted vehicle.
