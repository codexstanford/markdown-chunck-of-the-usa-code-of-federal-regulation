Access must be authorized by the Montana DOT. For vehicles operated under the Montana/Alberta MOU, access routes from I-15 into Shelby are authorized when permits are issued. For vehicles with a cargo-carrying length greater than 88 feet, but not more than 93 feet, a 2-mile access from the Interstate System is automatically granted to terminals and service areas. Access outside the 2-mile provision may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Administrator of the Motor Carrier Services Division.

ROUTES: Combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 88 feet, but not more than 93 feet, are limited to the Interstate System. Combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 88 feet or less can use all NN routes except U.S. 87 from milepost 79.3 to 82.5. For vehicles being operated under the Montana/Alberta MOU, the only route available is I-15 from the border with Canada to Shelby.
