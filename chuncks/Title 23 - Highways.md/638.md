####### Travel time data set.,i.e.,

(e)Travel time data needed to calculate the measures in subparts E, F, and G of this part will come from the NPMRDS, unless the State DOT requests, and FHWA approves, the use of an equivalent data source(s) that meets the requirements of this section. The State DOT shall establish, in coordination with applicable MPOs, a single travel time data set (NPMRDS or equivalent data set) that will be used to calculate the annual metrics in subparts E, F, and G of this part. The same data source shall be used for each calendar year. A State DOT and MPO(s) must use the same travel time data set for each reporting segment for the purposes of calculating the metrics and measures. The use of equivalent data source(s) shall comply with the following:

(1) State DOTs and MPOs shall use the same equivalent data source(s) for a calendar year;

(2) The State DOT shall request FHWA approval for the use of such equivalent data source(s) no later than October 1st before the beginning of the calendar year in which the data source would be used to calculate metrics and FHWA must approve the use of that data source prior to a State DOT and MPO(s)'s implementation and use of that data source;

(3) The State DOT shall make the equivalent data source(s) available to FHWA, on request;

(4) The State DOT shall maintain and use a documented data quality plan to routinely check the quality and accuracy of data contained within the equivalent data source(s); and

(5) If approved by FHWA, the equivalent data source(s) shall:

(i) Be used by both the State DOT and all MPOs within the State for all applicable travel time segments and be referenced by HPMS location referencing standards; and

(ii) In combination with or in place of NPMRDS data, include:

(A) Contiguous segments that cover the mainline highways full NHS, as defined in 23 U.S.C. 103, within the State and MPO boundary; and

(B) Average travel times for at least the same number of 15 minute intervals and the same locations that would be available in the NPMRDS;

(iii) Be populated with observed measured vehicle travel times and shall not be populated with travel times derived from imputed (historic travel times or other estimates) methods. Segment travel times may be derived from travel times reported over a longer time period of measurement (path processing or equivalent);

(iv) Include, for each segment at 15 minute intervals throughout the time periods specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section for each day of the year, the average travel time, recorded to the nearest second, representative of at least one of the following:

(A) All traffic on each segment of the NHS (24 hours on Interstate; 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. for non-Interstate NHS); or

(B) Freight vehicle traffic on each segment of the Interstate System (24 hours);

(v) Include, for each segment, a recording of the time and date of each 15 minute travel time record;

(vi) Include the location (route, functional class, direction, State), length and begin and end points of each segment; and

(vii) Be available within 60 days of measurement.
