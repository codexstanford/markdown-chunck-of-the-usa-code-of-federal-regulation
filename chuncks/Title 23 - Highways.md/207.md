####### i.e.

b. In order to make the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy known to all employees, prospective employees and potential sources of employees,, schools, employment agencies, labor unions (where appropriate), college placement officers, etc., the contractor will take the following actions:

(1) Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy will be placed in areas readily accessible to employees, applicants for employment and potential employees.

(2) The contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and the procedures to implement such policy will be brought to the attention of employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate means.

5. Recruitment. a. When advertising for employees, the contractor will include in all advertisements for employees the notation: "An Equal Opportunity Employer." All such advertisements will be published in newspapers or other publications having a large circulation among minority groups in the area from which the project work force would normally be derived.

b. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining agreement, conduct systematic and direct recruitment through public and private employee referral sources likely to yield qualified minority group applicants, including, but not limited to, State employment agencies, schools, colleges and minority group organizations. To meet this requirement, the contractor will, through his EEO Officer, identify sources of potential minority group employees, and establish with such identified sources procedures whereby minority group applicants may be referred to the contractor for employment consideration.

In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals, he is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system permits the contractor's compliance with equal employment opportunity contract provisions. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that where implementation of such agreements have the effect of discriminating against minorities or women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, such implementation violates Executive Order 11246, as amended.)

c. The contractor will encourage his present employees to refer minority group applicants for employment by posting appropriate notices or bulletins in areas accessible to all such employees. In addition, information and procedures with regard to referring minority group applicants will be discussed with employees.
