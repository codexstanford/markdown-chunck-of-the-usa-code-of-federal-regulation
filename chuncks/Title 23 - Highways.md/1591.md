####### Scour.

(o)(1) Perform a scour appraisal for all bridges over water, and document the process and results in the bridge file. Re-appraise when necessary to reflect changing scour conditions. Scour appraisal procedures should be consistent with Hydraulic Engineering Circulars (HEC) 18 and 20. Guidance for scour evaluations is located in HEC 18 and 20, and guidance for scour assessment is located in HEC 20.

(2) For bridges which are determined to be scour critical or have unknown foundations, prepare and document a scour POA for deployment of scour countermeasures for known and potential deficiencies, and to address safety concerns. The plan must address a schedule for repairing or installing physical and/or hydraulic scour countermeasures, and/or the use of monitoring as a scour countermeasure. Scour plans of actions should be consistent with HEC 18 and 23.
