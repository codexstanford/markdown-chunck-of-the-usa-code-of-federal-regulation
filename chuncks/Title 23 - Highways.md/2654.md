###### All possible planning.

All possible planning means that all reasonable measures identified in the Section 4(f) evaluation to minimize harm or mitigate for adverse impacts and effects must be included in the project.

(1) With regard to public parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, the measures may include (but are not limited to): design modifications or design goals; replacement of land or facilities of comparable value and function; or monetary compensation to enhance the remaining property or to mitigate the adverse impacts of the project in other ways.

(2) With regard to historic sites, the measures normally serve to preserve the historic activities, features, or attributes of the site as agreed by the Administration and the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource in accordance with the consultation process under 36 CFR part 800.

(3) In evaluating the reasonableness of measures to minimize harm under ยง 774.3(a)(2), the Administration will consider the preservation purpose of the statute and:

(i) The views of the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) property;

(ii) Whether the cost of the measures is a reasonable public expenditure in light of the adverse impacts of the project on the Section 4(f) property and the benefits of the measure to the property, in accordance with ยง 771.105(d) of this chapter; and

(iii) Any impacts or benefits of the measures to communities or environmental resources outside of the Section 4(f) property.
