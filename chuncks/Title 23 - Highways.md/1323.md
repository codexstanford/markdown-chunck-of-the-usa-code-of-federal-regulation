###### ยง 645.109 Preliminary engineering.

(a) As mutually agreed to by the TD and utility, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, preliminary engineering activities associated with utility relocation work may be done by:

(1) The TD's or utility's engineering forces;

(2) An engineering consultant selected by the TD, after consultation with the utility, the contract to be administered by the TD; or,

(3) An engineering consultant selected by the utility, with the approval of the TD, the contract to be administered by the utility.

(b) When a utility is not adequately staffed to pursue the necessary preliminary engineering and related work for the utility relocation, Federal funds may participate in the amount paid to engineers, architects, and others for required engineering and allied services provided such amounts are not based on a percentage of the cost of relocation. When Federal participation is requested by the STD in the cost of such services, the utility and its consultant shall agree in writing as to the services to be provided and the fees and arrangements for the services. Federal funds may participate in the cost of such services performed under existing written continuing contracts when it is demonstrated that such work is performed regularly for the utility in its own work and that the costs are reasonable.

(c) The procedures in 23 CFR part 172, Administration of Engineering and Design Related Service Contracts, may be used as a guide for reviewing proposed consultant contracts.
