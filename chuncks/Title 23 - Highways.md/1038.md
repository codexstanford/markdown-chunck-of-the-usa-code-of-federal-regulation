8.a. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, watchmen or guards (including apprentices and trainees described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above) shall require or permit any laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard in any workweek in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be.

b. In the event of any violation of paragraph 8a, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefor shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed with respect to each individual laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard employed in violation of paragraph 8a, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by paragraph 8a.

c. The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for liquidated damages as provided in paragraph 8b.
