#### PART 1240 - SAFETY INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR USE OF SEAT BELTS - ALLOCATIONS BASED ON SEAT BELT USE RATES
##### Appendix D to Part 1240 - Determination of National Average Seat Belt Use Rate
###### i.e.

C. The national average seat belt use rate for the calendar year will be determined by adding the weighted State seat belt use rates for each of the States (, the national average seat belt use rate is the weighted average of all the State seat belt use rates).

D. NHTSA may elect to use a seat belt use survey that does not comply with the Uniform Criteria for State Observational Surveys of Seat Belt Use in determining the national average seat belt use rate (even though the State that submitted the survey is ineligible to receive an allocation of funds), if in NHTSA's judgment, the deficiencies in the survey are not so substantial as to render the survey less accurate than the FARS estimate.
