####### Attainment area

means any geographic area in which levels of a given criteria air pollutant (e.g., ozone, carbon monoxide, PM, PM, and nitrogen dioxide) meet the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for that pollutant. An area may be an attainment area for one pollutant and a nonattainment area for others. A "maintenance area" (see definition in this section) is not considered an attainment area for transportation planning purposes.
