###### VEHICLE:

For a combination which includes a truck tractor and two trailing units, the lead trailing unit (semitrailer) may be up to 40 feet long. The second trailing unit may be up to 35 feet long. However, the primary control is the total cargo-carrying distance which has a maximum length of 68 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.
