###### WEIGHT:

The single-axle weight limit for LCV's is 18,000 pounds for axles spaced 9 feet or more apart. For axles spaced more than 3.5 but less than 9 feet apart, the single-axle weight limit is 13,000 pounds. The tandem-axle weight limit is 16,000 pounds per axle for the first tandem and 13,000 pounds per axle for all other tandems. Axles spaced less than 3.5 feet apart are limited to 9,000 pounds per axle. Maximum load per inch width of tire is 700 pounds. Maximum gross weight is determined based on axle and axle group weight limits.

When restricted seasonal loadings are in effect, load per inch width of tire and maximum axle weights are reduced as follows: Rigid pavements-525 pounds per inch of tire width, 25 percent axle weight reduction; Flexible pavements-450 pounds per inch of tire width, 35 percent axle weight reduction.
