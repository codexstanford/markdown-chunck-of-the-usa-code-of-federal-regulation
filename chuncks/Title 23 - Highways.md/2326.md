(c)Subpart D of this part applies to the management and disposal of real property interests acquired with TA funds, including alternate uses authorized under ROW use agreements. A TA project involving acquisition of any real property interest must have a real property agreement between FHWA and the grantee that identifies the expected useful life of the TA project and establishes a pro rata formula for repayment of TAP funding by the grantee if-

(1) The acquired real property interest is used in whole or in part for purposes other than the TA project purposes for which it was acquired; or

(2) The actual TA project life is less than the expected useful life specified in the real property agreement.
