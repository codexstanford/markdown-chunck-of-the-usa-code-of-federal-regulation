####### i.e.

1. Stations with park and ride lots with more than 500 vehicle parking spaces, or 5,000 daily bus or rail passengers, with significant highway access (, a high percentage of the passengers arrive by cars and buses using a route that connects to another NHS route), or a major hub terminal that provides for the transfer of passengers among several bus routes. (These hubs should have a significant number of buses using a principal route connecting with the NHS.)

1. Interstate/international-1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the year. (A ferry which connects two terminals within the same metropolitan area should be considered as local, not interstate.)

2. Local-see public transit criteria above.

Any of the following criteria could be used to justify an NHS connection to an intermodal terminal where there is a significant highway interface:

1. Intermodal terminals that handle more than 20 percent of passenger or freight volumes by mode within a State;

2. Intermodal terminals identified either in the Intermodal Management System or the State and metropolitan transportation plans as a major facility;

3. Significant investment in, or expansion of, an intermodal terminal; or

4. Connecting routes targeted by the State, MPO, or others for investment to address an existing, or anticipated, deficiency as a result of increased traffic.

Intermodal terminals, identified under the secondary criteria noted above, may not have sufficient highway traffic volumes to justify an NHS connection to the terminal. States and MPOs should fully consider whether a direct connection should be identified for such terminals, or whether being in the proximity (2 to 3 miles) of an NHS route is sufficient.
