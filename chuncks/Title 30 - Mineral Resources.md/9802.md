###### ยง 1206.468 How do I determine washing allowances if I have an arm's-length washing contract or no written arm's-length contract?

(a) If you or your affiliate incur(s) washing costs under an arm's-length washing contract, you may claim a washing allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred.

(b) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.

(c) If you have no contract for the washing of coal, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under ยง 1206.454. You may not use this paragraph (c), if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own washing. If you or your affiliate perform(s) the washing, then:

(1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in ยง 1206.458(a).

(2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues a determination.
