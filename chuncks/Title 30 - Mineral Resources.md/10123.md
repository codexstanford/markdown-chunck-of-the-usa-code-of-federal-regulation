###### ยง 1219.513 How will ONRR determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) from leases in the 181 Area, the 181 South Area, and the 2002-2007 Planning Area?
####### I,I,I,I

(2) For each Gulf producing State, we will divide the sum of each State's inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites calculated under paragraph (1), by the sum of the inverse distances from all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Central Planning Area and historical lease sites across all four Gulf producing States. In the formulas below,,,, andrepresent the sum of the inverses of the shortest distances between Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) and historical lease sites, respectively. We will multiply the result by the amount of shareable, qualified OCS revenues (Phase II-capped).

(3) If, in any fiscal year, this calculation results in less than a 10-percent allocation of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II-capped) to any Gulf producing State, we will recalculate the distribution. We will allocate 10 percent of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II-capped) to the affected State and recalculate the other States' shares of the remaining qualified OCS revenues (Phase II-capped), omitting from the calculation the State receiving the 10-percent minimum share.
