####### What are the requirements for establishing and applying operating meter factors for liquid hydrocarbons?

(h)(1) If you use a mechanical-displacement prover, you must record proof runs until five out of six consecutive runs produce a difference between individual runs of no greater than .05 percent. You must use the average of the five accepted runs to compute the meter factor.

(2) If you use a master meter, you must record proof runs until three consecutive runs produce a total meter factor difference of no greater than 0.0005. The flow rate through the meters during the proving must be within 10 percent of the rate at which the line meter will operate. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter factors of the three runs;

(3) If you use a tank prover, you must record proof runs until two consecutive runs produce a meter factor difference of no greater than .0005. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter factors of the two runs; and

(4) You must apply operating meter factors forward starting with the date of the proving.
