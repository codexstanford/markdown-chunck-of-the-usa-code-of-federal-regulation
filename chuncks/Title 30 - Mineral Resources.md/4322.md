######## How often must I test my detectors?

(7)(i) When conducting drilling, drill stem testing, well-completion, or well-workover operations in areas classified as HS present or HS unknown, test all detectors at least once every 24 hours. When drilling, begin functional testing before the bit is 1,500 feet (vertically) above the potential HS zone.

(ii) When conducting production operations, test all detectors at least every 14 days between tests.

(iii) If equipment requires calibration as a result of two consecutive functional tests, the District Manager may require that HS-detection and HS-monitoring equipment be functionally tested and calibrated more frequently.
