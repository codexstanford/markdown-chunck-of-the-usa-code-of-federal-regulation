####### ยง 203.72 Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?

Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one suspension volume under ยง 203.62 in two circumstances.

(a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of ยง 203.67.

(b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation criteria of ยง 203.67.
