###### ยง 553.43 When is my OSFR demonstration or the amendment to my OSFR demonstration effective?

(a) BOEM will notify you in writing when we approve your OSFR demonstration. If we find that you have not submitted all the information needed to demonstrate OSFR, we may require you to provide additional information before we determine whether your OSFR evidence is acceptable.

(b) Except in the case of self-insurance or an indemnity, BOEM acceptance of OSFR evidence is valid until the surety bond, insurance certificate, or other accepted OSFR instrument expires or is canceled. In the case of self-insurance or indemnity, acceptance is valid until the first day of the 5th month after the close of your or your indemnitor's current fiscal year.
