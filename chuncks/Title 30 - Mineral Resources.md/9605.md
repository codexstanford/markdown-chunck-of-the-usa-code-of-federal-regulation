####### ยง 1206.178 How do I determine a transportation allowance?
######## Adjusting incorrect allowances.

(e)If for any month the transportation allowance you are entitled to is less than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014, you are required to report and pay additional royalties due, plus interest computed under ยง 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month you deducted the improper transportation allowance until the date you pay the royalties due. If the transportation allowance you are entitled to is greater than the amount you took on Form ONRR-2014 for any royalties during the reporting period, you are entitled to a credit. No interest will be paid on the overpayment.
