####### Foreign Objects.

(7)(i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning the wound, removal of any foreign object by tweezers or other simple techniques, application of antiseptics and nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit. Follow-up visits are limited to observation including changing of bandages. Additional cleaning and applications of antiseptic constitute first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.

(ii) Medical treatment consists of removal of any foreign object by physician due to depth of imbedment, size or shape of object, or location of wound. Treatment for infection, treatment of a reaction to tetanus booster, or other professional treatment, is considered medical treatment.
