###### Other costs.

(o)Any other costs not covered in paragraphs (a)-(n) of this section and not disallowed by ยง 1220.013 that are incurred by the lessee in the necessary and proper conduct of NPSL operation and are approved by the ONRR Director, are allowable. Approval of a plan of development and production for the NPSL tract by the BOEM Director shall be considered sufficient approval for these other costs provided they are separately identified in said plan of development and production. Such separate identification shall note the nature of these other costs and may include an estimate of their magnitude. Any cost approvals under this paragraph for which the specific amounts have not been itemized are presumed to be approved provided they fall within the limits for a prudent operator. Approval of costs under this paragraph shall be approval solely for the purposes of determining allowable costs and shall not preclude a subsequent adjustment at audit of the amount of such costs.
