####### ยง 203.79 How do I appeal BSEE's decisions related to royalty relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?

(a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can request reconsideration by sending the BSEE Director a letter within 15 days that also states your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.

(b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty under ยง 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under ยง 203.69 are final agency actions.

(c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in ยง 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing the BSEE Director and stating your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.
