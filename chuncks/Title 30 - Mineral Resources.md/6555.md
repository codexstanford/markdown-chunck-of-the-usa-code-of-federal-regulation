BOEM will consider requests for ROW grants and RUE grants on a case-by-case basis and may issue a grant competitively, as provided in ยง 585.308, or noncompetitively if we determine after public notice that there is no competitive interest. BOEM will coordinate and consult with relevant Federal agencies, with the Governor of any affected State, and the executive of any affected local government.

(a) In response to an unsolicited request for a ROW grant or RUE grant, BOEM will first determine if there is competitive interest, as provided in ยง 585.307.

(b) If BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in a ROW grant or RUE grant, we will publish a notice in theof such determination. After BOEM publishes this notice, you will be responsible for submitting any required consistency certification and necessary data and information pursuant to 15 CFR part 930, subpart D, to the applicable State CZMA agency or agencies and BOEM. We will establish terms and conditions for the grant in consultation with you.
