####### ยง 57.5001 Exposure limits for airborne contaminants.
######## Measurement of airborne asbestos fiber concentration.

(3)Potential asbestos fiber concentration shall be determined by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) using the OSHA Reference Method in OSHA's asbestos standard found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix A, or a method at least equivalent to that method in identifying a potential asbestos exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit. When PCM results indicate a potential exposure exceeding the 0.1 f/cc full-shift limit or the 1 f/cc excursion limit, samples shall be further analyzed using transmission electron microscopy according to NIOSH Method 7402 or a method at least equivalent to that method.

(c) Employees shall be withdrawn from areas where there is present an airborne contaminant given a "C" designation by the Conference and the concentration exceeds the threshold limit value listed for that contaminant.
