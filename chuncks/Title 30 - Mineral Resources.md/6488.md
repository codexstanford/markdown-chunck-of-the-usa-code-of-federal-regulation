####### Geographic center of the project

means the centroid (geometric center point) of a qualified project area. The centroid represents the point that is the weighted average of coordinates of the same dimension within the mapping system, with the weights determined by the density function of the system. For example, in the case of a project area shaped as a rectangle or other parallelogram, the geographic center would be that point where lines between opposing corners intersect. The geographic center of a project could be outside the project area itself if that area is irregularly shaped.
