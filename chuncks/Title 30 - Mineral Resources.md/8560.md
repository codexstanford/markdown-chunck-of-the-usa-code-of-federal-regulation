### Subchapter R - Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation
#### PART 882 - RECLAMATION ON PRIVATE LAND
##### ยง 882.13 Liens.

(a) OSM, State, or Indian tribe has the discretionary authority to place or waive a lien against land reclaimed if the reclamation results in a significant increase in the fair market value; except that-

(1) A lien must not be placed against the property of a surface owner who did not consent to, participate in or exercise control over the mining operation which necessitated the reclamation work.

(2) The basis for making a determination of what constitutes a significant increase in market value or what factual situation constitutes a waiver of lien will be made by OSM, State, or Indian tribe pursuant to the Congressional intent expressed in section 408 of the Act and consistent with State or Indian tribal laws governing liens.

(3) A lien may be waived if findings made prior to construction indicate that the reclamation work to be performed on private land shall primarily benefit the health, safety, or environmental values of the greater community or area in which the land is located; or if the reclamation is necessitated by an unforeseen occurrence, and the work performed to restore that land will not result in a significant increase in the market value of the land as it existed immediately before the unforeseen occurrence; and

(4) OSM, State, or Indian tribe may waive the lien if the cost of filing it, including indirect costs to OSM, State, or Indian tribe, exceeds the increase in fair market value as a result of reclamation activities.
