####### Example 2.

(2)Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that the lessee transports and exchanges to Midland 40 percent of the production from the lease near Artesia and transports the remaining 60 percent directly to its own refinery in Ohio. In this example, the 40 percent of the production would be valued at $83.46/bbl, as explained in the previous example. In this example, the other 60 percent also would be valued at $83.46/bbl.
