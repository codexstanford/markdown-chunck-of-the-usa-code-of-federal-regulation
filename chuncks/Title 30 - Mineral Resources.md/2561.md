#### PART 62 - OCCUPATIONAL NOISE EXPOSURE
##### ยง 62.110 Noise exposure assessment.

(a) The mine operator must establish a system of monitoring that evaluates each miner's noise exposure sufficiently to determine continuing compliance with this part.

(b) The mine operator must determine a miner's noise dose (D, in percent) by using a noise dosimeter or by computing the formula: D = 100(C/T+ C/T+ . . . . + C/T), where Cn is the total time the miner is exposed at a specified sound level, and Tis the reference duration of exposure at that sound level shown in Table 62-1.

(1) The mine operator must use Table 62-2 when converting from dose readings to equivalent TWAreadings.

(2) A miner's noise dose determination must:

(i) Be made without adjustment for the use of any hearing protector;

(ii) Integrate all sound levels over the appropriate range;

(iii) Reflect the miner's full work shift;

(iv) Use a 90-dB criterion level and a 5-dB exchange rate; and

(v) Use the A-weighting and slow response instrument settings.
