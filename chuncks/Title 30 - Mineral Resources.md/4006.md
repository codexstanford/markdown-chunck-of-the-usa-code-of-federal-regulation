######## i.e.,

(3) Distributions or point estimates (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for the parameters used to estimate reservoir size,acres and net thickness;

(4) Most likely values for porosity, salt water saturation, volume factor for oil formation, and volume factor for gas formation;

(5) Distributions or point estimates (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for recovery efficiency (in percent) and oil or gas recovery (in stock-tank-barrels per acre-foot or in thousands of cubic feet per acre foot);

(6) A gas/oil ratio distribution or point estimate (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for each reservoir;

(7) A yield distribution or point estimate (accompanied by explanations of why distributions less appropriately reflect the uncertainty) for each gas reservoir; and

(8) Reserve or resource distribution by reservoir.

(e) Aggregated reserve and resource data which includes:

(1) The aggregated distributions for reserves and resources (in BOE) and oil fraction for your field computed by the resource module of our RSVP model;
