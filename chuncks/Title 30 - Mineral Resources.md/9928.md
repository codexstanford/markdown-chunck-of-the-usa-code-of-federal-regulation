###### ยง 1210.202 How do I submit sales summaries?
####### When to submit.

(b)(1) For leases with ad valorem royalty terms (that is, leases for which royalty is a percentage of the value of production), you must submit your sales summaries monthly at the same time you submit Form ONRR-4430. You do not have to submit a sales summary for any month in which you did not sell Federal or Indian production.

(2) For leases with no ad valorem royalty terms (that is, leases in which the royalty due is not a function of the value of production, such as cents-per-ton or dollars-per-unit), you must submit monthly sales summaries only if we specifically request you to do so.
