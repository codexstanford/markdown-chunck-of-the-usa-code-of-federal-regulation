###### Substantial legal and financial commitments in a surface coal mining operation

means significant investments that have been made on the basis of a long-term coal contract in power plants, railroads, coal-handling, preparation, extraction or storage facilities, and other capital-intensive activities. Costs of acquiring the coal in place, or the right to mine it alone without other significant investments, as described above, are not sufficient to constitute substantial legal and financial commitments.
