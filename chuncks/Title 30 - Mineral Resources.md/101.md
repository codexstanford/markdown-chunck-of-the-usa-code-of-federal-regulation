####### Non-incendive electric contacts.

(g)In the normal operation of a blasting unit, the electric energy discharged by making and breaking electric contacts shall not be capable of igniting a methane-air atmosphere, as determined by the following:

(1) The electric current through an electric contact shall not be greater than that determined from Figure D-1.

(2) The maximum voltage that can be applied across an electric contact that discharges a capacitor shall not be greater than that determined from Figure D-2.

(3) The electric current through an electric contact that interrupts a circuit containing inductive components shall not be greater than that determined from Figure D-3. Inductive components include inductors, chokes, relay coils, motors, transformers, and similar electric components that have an inductance greater than 100 microhenries. No inductive component in a circuit with making and breaking electric contacts shall have an inductance value greater than 100 millihenries.
