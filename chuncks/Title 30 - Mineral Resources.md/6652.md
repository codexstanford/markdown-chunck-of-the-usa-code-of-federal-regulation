######## etc.,e.g.,

(6) Changes in the location of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains,) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations (if a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision);

(7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or

(8) Change in any other activity specified by BOEM.

(d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:

(1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;

(2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or

(3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.

(e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:

(1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and

(2) Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.
