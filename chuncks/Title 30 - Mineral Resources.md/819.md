###### ยง 36.25 Engine exhaust system.
####### Tightness of exhaust system.

(e)All joints in the exhaust system shall be tight to prevent the flow of exhaust gas through them under any condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA. A tight system shall be obtained by the use of ground joints, or thin metal or metal-clad gaskets. All such joints shall be fitted with adequate through bolts and all gaskets shall be aligned and held firmly in position by the bolts or other suitable means. Such joints shall remain tight to prevent passage of flame or propagation of repeated internal explosions to a surrounding flammable mixture.
