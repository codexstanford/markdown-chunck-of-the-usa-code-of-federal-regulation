####### Other non-allowable costs.

(8)Any cost you or your affiliate incur(s) for services that you are required to provide at no cost to the lessor, including, but not limited to, costs to place your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products into marketable condition disallowed under § 1206.146 and costs of boosting residue gas disallowed under § 1202.151(b).

(d) If you have no written contract for the transportation of gas, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.144. You may not use this paragraph (d) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.

(2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues its determination.
