####### Accuracy.

(b)The ability of a CPDM to determine the true concentration of respirable coal mine dust at the end of a shift shall be established through testing that demonstrates the following:

(1) For full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are within +/-25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over a concentration range from 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m; and

(2) For intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours, a 95 percent confidence that the recorded measurements are within +/-25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over the concentration range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/mfor an 8-hour period.
