####### ยง 550.218 What air emissions information must accompany the EP?
######## Projected emissions.

(a)Tables showing the projected emissions of criteria air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and total suspended particulates (TSP) generated by your proposed exploration activities.

(1) For each source on or associated with the drilling unit (including well test flaring and well protection structure installation), you must list:

(i) The projected peak hourly emissions;

(ii) The total annual emissions in tons per year;

(iii) Emissions over the duration of the proposed exploration activities;

(iv) The frequency and duration of emissions; and

(v) The total of all emissions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(2) You must provide the basis for all calculations, including engine size and rating, and applicable operational information.

(3) You must base the projected emissions on the maximum rated capacity of the equipment on the proposed drilling unit under its physical and operational design.

(4) If the specific drilling unit has not yet been determined, you must use the maximum emission estimates for the type of drilling unit you will use.
