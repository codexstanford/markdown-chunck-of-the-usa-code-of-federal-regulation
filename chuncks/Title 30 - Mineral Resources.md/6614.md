####### ยง 585.532 What happens if my surety wants to terminate the period of liability of my bond?

(a) Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during which surety liability continues to accrue. The surety continues to be responsible for obligations and liabilities that accrued during the period of liability and before the date on which BOEM terminates the period of liability under paragraph (b) of this section. The liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include:

(1) Obligations that started to accrue before the beginning of the period of liability and have not been met; and

(2) Obligations that began accruing during the period of liability.

(b) Your surety must submit to BOEM its request to terminate the period of liability under its bond and notify you of that request. If you intend to continue activities, or have not met all obligations of your lease or grant, you must provide a replacement bond or alternative form of financial assurance of equivalent or greater value. BOEM will terminate that period of liability within 90 days after BOEM receives the request.
