####### Equivalent concentration.

The concentration of respirable coal mine dust, including quartz, expressed in milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m) as measured with an approved sampling device, determined by dividing the weight of dust in milligrams collected on the filter of an approved sampling device by the volume of air in cubic meters passing through the filter (sampling time in minutes (t) times the sampling airflow rate in cubic meters per minute), and then converting that concentration to an equivalent concentration as measured by the Mining Research Establishment (MRE) instrument. When the approved sampling device is:

(1) The CMDPSU, the equivalent concentration is determined by multiplying the concentration of respirable coal mine dust by the constant factor prescribed by the Secretary.

(2) The CPDM, the device shall be programmed to automatically report end-of-shift concentration measurements as equivalent concentrations.
