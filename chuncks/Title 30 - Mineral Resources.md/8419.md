##### § 870.18 General rules for calculating excess moisture.

If you are an operator who mined coal after June 1988, you may deduct the weight of excess moisture in the coal to determine reclamation fees you owe under 30 CFR 870.12(b)(3)(i). Excess moisture is the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture. To calculate excess moisture in HIGH-rank coal, follow § 870.19. To calculate excess moisture in LOW-rank coal, follow § 870.20. Report your calculations on the OSM-1 form, Coal Reclamation Fee Report, for every calendar quarter in which you claim a deduction. Some cautions:

(a) You or your customer may do any test required by §§ 870.19 and 870.20. But whoever does a test, you are to keep test results and all related records for at least six years after the test date.

(b) If OSM disallows any or all of an allowance for excess moisture, you must submit an additional fee plus interest computed according to § 870.21(a) and penalties computed according to § 870.21(c).
