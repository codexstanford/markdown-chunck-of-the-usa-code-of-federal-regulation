###### ยง 556.305 How does BOEM coordinate and consult with States regarding a proposed notice of sale?

(a) Within 60 days after receiving the proposed notice of sale, governors of affected States may submit comments and recommendations to BOEM regarding the size, timing, and location of the proposed sale. Local governments may comment to BOEM directly, but must also send their comments to the governor of their State.

(b) BOEM will provide a consistency determination under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) (16 U.S.C. 1456) to each State with an approved coastal zone management program that will determine whether the proposed sale is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the enforceable policies of the State's approved coastal zone management program.
