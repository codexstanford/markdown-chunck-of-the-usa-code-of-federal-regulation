######### Modeling report.

(d)(1) If you have determined or estimated that the concentration of any HS you may encounter or handle while you conduct your development and production activities will be greater than 500 parts per million (ppm), you must:

(i) Model a potential worst case HS release from the facilities you will use to conduct your proposed development and production activities; and

(ii) Include a modeling report or modeling results, or a reference to such report or results if you have already submitted it to the Regional Supervisor.

(2) The analysis in the modeling report must be specific to the particular site of your development and production activities, and must consider any nearby human-occupied OCS facilities, shipping lanes, fishery areas, and other points where humans may be subject to potential exposure from an HS release from your proposed activities.

(3) If any HS emissions are projected to affect an onshore location in concentrations greater than 10 ppm, the modeling analysis must be consistent with the EPA's risk management plan methodologies outlined in 40 CFR part 68.
