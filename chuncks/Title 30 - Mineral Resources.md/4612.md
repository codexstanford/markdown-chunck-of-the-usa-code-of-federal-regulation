####### Gas processing plant

-an installation that uses any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Processing does not include treatment operations, including those necessary to put gas into marketable conditions such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, desulphurization, and compression. The changing of pressures or temperatures in a reservoir is not processing.
