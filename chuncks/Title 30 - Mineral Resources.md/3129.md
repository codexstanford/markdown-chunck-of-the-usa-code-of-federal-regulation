######## Disconnecting switches.

(c)Each disconnecting switch must be labeled to clearly identify the circuit it disconnects, and be designed and installed as follows:

(1) Rated for the maximum phase-to-phase voltage of the circuit;

(2) Rated for the full-load current of the circuit that is supplied power through the device.

(3) Allow for visual observation, without removing any covers, to verify that the contacts are open;

(4) Ground all power conductors on the load side when the switch is in the "open and grounded" position;

(5) Can only be locked out in the "open and grounded" position; and

(6) Safely interrupts the full-load current of the circuit or causes the current to be interrupted automatically before the disconnecting switch opens.
