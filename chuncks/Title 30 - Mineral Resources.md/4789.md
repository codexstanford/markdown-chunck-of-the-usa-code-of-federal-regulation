###### § 250.1628 Design, installation, and operation of production systems.
####### Approval of safety-systems design and installation features for fuel gas system.

(d)Prior to installation, the lessee shall submit a fuel gas safety system application, in duplicate, to the District Manager for approval. The application shall include information relative to the proposed design and installation features. Information concerning approved design and installation features shall be maintained by the lessee at the lessee's offshore field office nearest the OCS facility or at another location conveniently available to the District Manager. All approvals are subject to field verification. The application shall include the following:

(1) A schematic flow diagram showing size, capacity, design, working pressure of separators, storage tanks, compressor pumps, metering devices, and other hydrocarbon-handling vessels;

(2) A schematic flow diagram (API RP 14C, Figure E1, as incorporated by reference in § 250.198) and the related Safety Analysis Function Evaluation chart (API RP 14C, subsection 4.3c, as incorporated by reference in § 250.198).

(3) A schematic piping diagram showing the size and maximum allowable working pressures as determined in accordance with API RP 14E, Design and Installation of Offshore Production Platform Piping Systems (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198);

(4) Electrical system information including the following:

(i) A plan of each platform deck, outlining all hazardous areas classified according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2, or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities Classified as Class I, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), and outlining areas in which potential ignition sources are to be installed;

(ii) All significant hydrocarbon sources and a description of the type of decking, ceiling, walls (e.g., grating or solid), and firewalls; and

(iii) Elementary electrical schematic of any platform safety shutdown system with a functional legend.

(5) Certification that the design for the mechanical and electrical systems to be installed was approved by registered professional engineers. After these systems are installed, the lessee shall submit a statement to the District Manager certifying that the new installations conform to the approved designs of this subpart; and

(6) Design and schematics of the installation and maintenance of all fire- and gas-detection systems including the following:

(i) Type, location, and number of detection heads;

(ii) Type and kind of alarm, including emergency equipment to be activated;

(iii) Method used for detection;

(iv) Method and frequency of calibration; and

(v) A functional block diagram of the detection system, including the electric power supply.
