###### Scale-distance equation.,W,D/Ds,W,D,Ds

(3)(i) An operator may use the scaled-distance equation,= (), to determine the allowable charge weight of explosives to be detonated in any 8-millisecond period, without seismic monitoring; where= the maximum weight of explosives, in pounds;= the distance, in feet, from the blasting site to the nearest protected structure; and= the scaled-distance factor, which may initially be approved by the regulatory authority using the values for scaled-distance factor listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

(ii) The development of a modified scaled-distance factor may be authorized by the regulatory authority on receipt of a written request by the operator, supported by seismographic records of blasting at the minesite. The modified scale-distance factor shall be determined such that the particle velocity of the predicted ground vibration will not exceed the prescribed maximum allowable peak particle velocity of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, at a 95-percent confidence level.
