###### § 1206.53 How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my affiliate do(es) not sell under an arm's-length contract?
####### Example 3.

(3)The volume-weighted average price is ((10,000 bbl x $34.50/bbl) + (9,000 bbl x $33.35/bbl) + (4,000 bbl x $33.30/bbl)) / 23,000 bbl = $33.84/bbl. That price will be the value of the oil produced from the lease and refined prior to an arm's-length sale under this section.

(c) If you value oil under this section, ONRR will allow a deduction, under §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, for the reasonable, actual costs:

(1) That you incur to transport oil that you or your affiliate sell(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average price calculation, from the lease to the point where the oil is sold.

(2) That the seller incurs to transport oil that you or your affiliate purchase(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average cost calculation, from the property where it is produced to the point where you or your affiliate purchase(s) it. You may not deduct any costs of gathering as part of a transportation deduction or allowance.

(d) If paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.
