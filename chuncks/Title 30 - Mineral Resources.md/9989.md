####### When is a payment to ONRR due?

(g)(1) All payments are due to ONRR at the time law, regulation, or lease terms require unless ONRR approves a change according to part 1243 of this chapter. If you file an appeal, and the requirement to submit payment is suspended, the original payment due date for purposes such as calculating late payment interest is not changed.

(2) If you use the U.S. Postal Service, courier, or overnight mail to send your payment, it is due at the ONRR addresses in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section before 4 p.m. Mountain Time on the due date, regardless of when you sent it.

(3) If you use EFT to send your payment, it is due in the ONRR account by the payment due date. You are responsible for your actions or your bank's actions that cause a late or incorrect payment. You will not be held responsible for mechanical or system failures of EFT payments.
