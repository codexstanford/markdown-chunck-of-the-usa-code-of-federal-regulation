###### ยง 590.7 Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my appeal is pending?

(a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for filing an appeal under ยง 590.3 unless:

(1) OMM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any mineral deposit, or property; or

(2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 550.1409 pending the appeal challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.

(b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of OMM orders.

(c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or order under appeal.
