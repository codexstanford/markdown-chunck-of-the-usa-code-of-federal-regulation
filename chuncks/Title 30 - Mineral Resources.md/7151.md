(b)(1) After final grading and before the topsoil is replaced, regraded land shall be scarified or otherwise treated to eliminate slippage surfaces and to promote root penetration.

(i) Achieves an approximate uniform thickness consistent with the postmining land uses;

(ii) Prevents excess compaction of the spoil and topsoil; and

(iii) Protects the topsoil from wind and water erosion before it is seeded and planted.
