######## Where must I have sensors for production operations?

(5)On a platform where gas containing HS of 20 ppm or greater is produced, processed, or otherwise handled:

(i) You must have a sensor in rooms, buildings, deck areas, or low-laying deck areas not otherwise covered by paragraph (j)(2) of this section, where atmospheric concentrations of HS could reach 20 ppm or more. You must have at least one sensor per 400 square feet of deck area or fractional part of 400 square feet;

(ii) You must have a sensor in buildings where personnel have their living quarters;

(iii) You must have a sensor within 10 feet of each vessel, compressor, wellhead, manifold, or pump, which could release enough HS to result in atmospheric concentrations of 20 ppm at a distance of 10 feet from the component;

(iv) You may use one sensor to detect HS around multiple pieces of equipment, provided the sensor is located no more than 10 feet from each piece, except that you need to use at least two sensors to monitor compressors exceeding 50 horsepower;

(v) You do not need to have sensors near wells that are shut in at the master valve and sealed closed;

(vi) When you determine where to place sensors, you must consider:

(A) The location of system fittings, flanges, valves, and other devices subject to leaks to the atmosphere; and

(B) Design factors, such as the type of decking and the location of fire walls; and

(vii) The District Manager may require additional sensors or other monitoring capabilities, if warranted by site specific conditions.
