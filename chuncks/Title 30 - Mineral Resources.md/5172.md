####### ยง 285.700 What reports must I submit to BSEE before installing facilities described in my approved SAP, COP, or GAP?

(a) You must submit the following reports to BSEE before installing facilities described in your approved COP (ยง 285.632(a)) and, when required by 30 CFR part 585, your SAP (ยง 285.614(b)), or GAP (ยง 285.651):

(1) A Facility Design Report; and

(2) A Fabrication and Installation Report.

(b) You may begin to fabricate and install the approved facilities after BSEE notifies you that it has received your reports and has no objections. If BSEE receives the reports, but does not respond with objections within 60 days of receipt, or 60 days after BOEM approves your SAP, COP, or GAP if you submitted your report with the plan, BSEE is deemed not to have objections to the reports, and you may commence fabrication and installation of your facility or facilities.

(c) If BSEE has any objections, we will notify you verbally or in writing within 60 days of receipt of the report. Following initial notification of objections, BSEE may follow-up with written correspondence outlining its specific objections to the report and request that certain actions be undertaken. You cannot commence activities addressed in such report until you resolve all objections to BSEE's satisfaction.
