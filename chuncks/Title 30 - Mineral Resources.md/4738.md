(b) A determination under paragraph (a) of this section shall be based upon the following:

(1) Core analyses that indicate the presence of a producible sulphur deposit (including an assay of elemental sulphur);

(2) An estimate of the amount of recoverable sulphur in long tons over a specified period of time; and

(3) Contour map of the cap rock together with isopach map showing the extent and estimated thickness of the sulphur deposit.
