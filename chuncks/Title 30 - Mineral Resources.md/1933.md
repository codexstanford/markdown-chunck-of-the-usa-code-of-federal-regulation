######## Mechanical ventilation reversal.

(c)If used as an alternative, reversal of mechanical ventilation shall-

(1) Be accomplished by a main fan. If the main fan is located underground:

(i) The cable or conductors supplying power to the fan shall be routed through areas free of fire hazards; or

(ii) The main fan shall be equipped with a second, independent power cable or set of conductors from the surface. The power cable or conductors shall be located so that an underground fire disrupting power in one cable or set of conductors will not affect the other; or

(iii) A second fan capable of accomplishing ventilation reversal shall be available for use in the event of failure of the main fan;

(2) Provide rapid air reversal that allows persons underground time to exit in fresh air by the second escapeway or find a place of refuge; and

(3) Be done according to predetermined conditions and procedures.
