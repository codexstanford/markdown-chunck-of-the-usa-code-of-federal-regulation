###### ยง 1206.358 What are byproduct transportation allowances?
####### Reporting requirements.

(d)(1) You must use a discrete field on Form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of a transportation allowance.

(2) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR may require you to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. You must comply with any such requirements within the time ONRR specifies. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1212 of this chapter.

(e) Byproduct transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, review, and audit. If, after a review or audit, ONRR determines that you have improperly determined a byproduct transportation allowance, you must pay any additional royalties due (plus interest computed under ยง 1218.302 of this chapter). You are entitled to a credit for or refund of any overpaid royalties.

(f) If you commingled byproducts produced from Federal and non-Federal leases for transportation, you may not disproportionately allocate transportation costs to Federal lease production.
