####### Cartridge diameter and length changes.

(h)(1) For proposed changes to an approved explosive involving only cartridge diameter or length, MSHA will determine what tests, if any, will be required.

(2) When a proposed change to an approved explosive involves a smaller diameter than that specified in the approval, the rate-of-detonation and air-gap sensitivity tests will be conducted.

(3) No test will be conducted on cartridges with diameters the same as or smaller than those that previously failed to detonate in the rate-of-detonation test.
