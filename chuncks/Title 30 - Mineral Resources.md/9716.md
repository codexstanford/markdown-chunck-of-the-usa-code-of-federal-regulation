###### ยง 1206.261 How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract or no written arm's-length contract?

(a) If you or your affiliate incur(s) transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred for transporting the coal under that contract.

(b) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is at arm's-length.

(c) If you have no written contract for the arm's-length transportation of coal, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under ยง 1206.254. You may not use this paragraph (c) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.

(1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in ยง 1206.258(a).

(2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues a determination.
