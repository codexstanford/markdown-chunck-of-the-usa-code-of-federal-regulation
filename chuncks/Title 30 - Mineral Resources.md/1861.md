####### Working level

(WL) means any combination of the short-lived radon daughters in one liter of air that will result in ultimate emission of 1.3 x 10MeV (million electron volts) of potential alpha energy, and exposure to these radon daughters over a period of time is expressed in terms of "working level months" (WLM). Inhalation of air containing a radon daughter concentration of 1 WL for 173 hours results in an exposure of 1 WLM."
