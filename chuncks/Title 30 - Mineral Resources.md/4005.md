####### ยง 203.86 What is in a G&G report?

This report supports the reserve and resource estimates used in the economic evaluation and must contain each of the following elements.

(a) Seismic data which includes:

(1) Non-interpreted 2D/3D survey lines reflecting any available state-of-the-art processing technique in a format readable by BSEE and specified by the deep water royalty relief guidelines;

(2) Interpreted 2D/3D seismic survey lines reflecting any available state-of-the-art processing technique identifying all known and prospective pay horizons, wells, and fault cuts;

(3) Digital velocity surveys in the format of the GOM region's letter to lessees of 10/1/90;

(4) Plat map of "shot points;" and

(5) "Time slices" of potential horizons.

(b) Well data which includes:

(1) Hard copies of all well logs in which-

(i) The 1-inch electric log shows pay zones and pay counts and lithologic and paleo correlation markers at least every 500-feet,

(ii) The 1-inch type log shows missing sections from other logs where faulting occurs,

(iii) The 5-inch electric log shows pay zones and pay counts and labeled points used in establishing resistivity of the formation, 100 percent water saturated (R) and the resistivity of the undisturbed formation (R), and

(iv) The 5-inch porosity logs show pay zones and pay counts and labeled points used in establishing reservoir porosity or labeled points showing values used in calculating reservoir porosity such as bulk density or transit time;

(2) Digital copies of all well logs spudded before December 1, 1995;

(3) Core data, if available;

(4) Well correlation sections;

(5) Pressure data;

(6) Production test results;

(7) Pressure-volume-temperature analysis, if available; and

(8) A table listing the wells and completions, and indicating which sands and fault blocks will be targeted for completion or recompletion.

(c) Map interpretations which includes for each reservoir in the field:

(1) Structure maps consisting of top and base of sand maps showing well and seismic shot point locations;

(2) Isopach maps for net sand, net oil, net gas, all with well locations;

(3) Maps indicating well surface and bottom hole locations, location of development facilities, and shot points; and

(4) An explanation for excluding the reservoirs you are not planning to develop.

(d) Reservoir-specific data which includes:

(1) Probability of reservoir occurrence with hydrocarbons;

(2) Probability the hydrocarbon in the reservoir is all oil and the probability it is all gas;
