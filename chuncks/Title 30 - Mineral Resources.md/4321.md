######## How must I functionally test the H,S Detectors?

(6)(i) Personnel trained to calibrate the particular HS detector equipment being used must test detectors by exposing them to a known concentration in the range of 10 to 30 ppm of HS.

(ii) If the results of any functional test are not within 2 ppm or 10 percent, whichever is greater, of the applied concentration, recalibrate the instrument.
