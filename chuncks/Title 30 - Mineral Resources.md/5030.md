###### ยง 254.51 Modifying an existing OCS OSRP.

You may modify an existing response plan covering a lease or facility on the OCS to include a lease or facility in State waters located seaward of the coast line. Since this OSRP would cover more than one lease or facility, it would be considered a Regional Response Plan. You should refer to ยง 254.3 and contact the appropriate regional BSEE office if you have any questions on how to prepare this Regional Response Plan.
