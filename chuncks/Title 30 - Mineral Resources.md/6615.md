####### § 585.533 How does my surety obtain cancellation of my bond?

(a) BOEM will release a bond or allow a surety to cancel a bond, and will relieve the surety from accrued obligations only if:

(1) BOEM determines that there are no outstanding obligations covered by the bond; or

(2) The following occurs:

(i) BOEM accepts a replacement bond or an alternative form of financial assurance in an amount equal to or greater than the bond to be cancelled to cover the terminated period of liability;

(ii) The surety issuing the new bond has expressly agreed to assume all outstanding liabilities under the original bond that accrued during the period of liability that was terminated; and

(iii) The surety issuing the new bond has agreed to assume that portion of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the terminated period of liability that exceeds the coverage of the bond prescribed under § 585.515, § 585.516, § 585.520, or § 585.521, and of which you were notified.

(b) When your lease or grant ends, your surety(ies) remain(s) responsible, and BOEM will retain any financial assurance as follows:

(1) The period of liability ends when you cease all operations and activities under the lease or grant, including decommissioning and site clearance;

(2) Your surety or collateral financial assurance will not be released until 7 years after the lease ends, or a longer period as necessary to complete any appeals or judicial litigation related to your bonded obligation, or for BOEM to determine that all of your obligations under the lease or grant have been satisfied; and

(3) BOEM will reduce the amount of your bond or return a portion of your financial assurance if we determine that we need less than the full amount of the bond or financial assurance to meet any possible future obligations.
