###### ยง 1219.513 How will ONRR determine each Gulf producing State's share of the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II) from leases in the 181 Area, the 181 South Area, and the 2002-2007 Planning Area?

(a) ONRR will determine the great circle distance between:

(1) The geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site; and

(2) The point on the coastline of each Gulf producing State that is closest to the geographic center of each applicable leased tract (Phase II) or historical lease site.

(b) Based on a specific subset of these distances, we will calculate the qualified OCS revenues (Phase II-uncapped) to disburse to each Gulf producing State as follows:

(1) For each Gulf producing State, we will calculate and total, over all applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area, the mathematical inverses of the distances between the points on the State's coastline that are closest to the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area, and the geographic centers of the applicable leased tracts (Phase II) located in the 181 Area in the Eastern Planning Area or the 181 South Area.
