(a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved SAP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing SAP or require a revision to your SAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.

(b) BOEM will periodically review the activities under an approved SAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your SAP. If the review indicates that the SAP should be revised to meet the requirements of this part, BOEM will require you to submit the needed revisions.

(c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your SAP will likely be necessary include:

(1) Activities not described in your approved SAP;

(2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;

(3) Changes in the surface location of a facility or structure;

(4) Addition of a facility or structure not contemplated in your approved SAP;

(5) Changes in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another, or to a new base requiring expansion;
