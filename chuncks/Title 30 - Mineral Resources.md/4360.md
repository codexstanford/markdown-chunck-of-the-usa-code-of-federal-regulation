####### ยง 250.525 When am I required to take action from my casing diagnostic test?

You must take action if you have any of the following conditions:

(a) Any fixed platform well with a casing pressure exceeding its maximum allowable wellhead operating pressure (MAWOP);

(b) Any fixed platform well with a casing pressure that is greater than 100 psig and that cannot bleed to 0 psig through a-inch needle valve within 24 hours, or is not bled to 0 psig during a casing diagnostic test;

(c) Any well that has demonstrated tubing/casing, tubing/riser, casing/casing, riser/casing, or riser/riser communication;

(d) Any well that has sustained casing pressure (SCP) and is bled down to prevent it from exceeding its MAWOP, except during initial startup operations described in ยง 250.522;

(e) Any hybrid well with casing or riser pressure exceeding 100 psig; or

(f) Any subsea well with a casing pressure 100 psig greater than the external hydrostatic pressure at the subsea wellhead.
