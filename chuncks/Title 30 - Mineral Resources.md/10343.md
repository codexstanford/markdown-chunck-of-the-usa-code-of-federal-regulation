(a) ONRR will determine the amount of the penalty to assess by considering:

(1) The severity of the violation.

(2) Your history of noncompliance.

(3) The size of your business. To determine the size of your business, we may consider the number of employees in your company, parent company or companies, and any subsidiaries and contractors.

(b) We will not consider the royalty consequence of the underlying violation when determining the amount of the civil penalty for a violation under ยง 1241.50 or ยง 1241.60(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2).

(c) We will post the FCCP and ILCP assessment matrices and any adjustments to the matrices on our Web site.
