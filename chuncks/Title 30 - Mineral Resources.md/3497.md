####### Requirements for a proximity detection system.

(b)A proximity detection system includes machine-mounted components and miner-wearable components. The system must:

(1) Cause a machine, which is tramming from place-to-place or repositioning, to stop before contacting a miner except for a miner who is in the on-board operator's compartment;

(2) Provide an audible and visual warning signal on the miner-wearable component and a visual warning signal on the machine that alert miners before the system causes a machine to stop. These warning signals must be distinguishable from other signals;

(3) Provide a visual signal on the machine that indicates the machine-mounted components are functioning properly;

(4) Prevent movement of the machine if any machine-mounted component of the system is not functioning properly. However, a system with any machine-mounted component that is not functioning properly may allow machine movement if it provides an audible or visual warning signal, distinguishable from other signals, during movement. Such movement is permitted only for purposes of relocating the machine from an unsafe location for repair;

(5) Be installed to prevent interference that adversely affects performance of any electrical system; and

(6) Be installed and maintained in proper operating condition by a person trained in the installation and maintenance of the system.
