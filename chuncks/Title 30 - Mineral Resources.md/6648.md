####### ยง 585.628 How will BOEM process my COP?
######## e.g.,

(f) Upon completion of our technical and environmental reviews and other reviews required by Federal law (CZMA), BOEM may approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications your COP.

(1) If we approve your COP, we will specify terms and conditions to be incorporated into your COP. You must certify compliance with certain of those terms and conditions, as required under 30 CFR 285.633(a); and

(2) If we disapprove your COP, we will inform you of the reasons and allow you an opportunity to resubmit a revised plan addressing the concerns identified, and may suspend the term of your lease, as appropriate, to allow this to occur.

(g) If BOEM approves your project easement, BOEM will issue an addendum to your lease specifying the terms of the project easement. A project easement may include off-lease areas that:

(1) Contain the sites on which cable, pipeline, or associated facilities are located;

(2) Do not exceed 200 feet (61 meters) in width, unless safety and environmental factors during construction and maintenance of the associated cables or pipelines require a greater width; and

(3) For associated facilities, are limited to the area reasonably necessary for power or pumping stations or other accessory facilities.
