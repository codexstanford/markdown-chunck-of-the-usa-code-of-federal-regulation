####### Production from leases in California or Alaska.

(a)Value is the average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any ONRR-approved publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production month. For example, if the production month is June, calculate the average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices published in the ONRR-approved publication for all of the business days in June.

(1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, you must average the daily high and low prices for the month in the selected publication.

(2) You must use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such prices are published.

(3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under ยง 1206.111.

(4) After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.
