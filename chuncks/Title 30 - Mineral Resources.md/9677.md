####### Processing

means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, desulphurization (or "sweetening"), and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
