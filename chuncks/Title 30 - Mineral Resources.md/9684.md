###### § 1206.172 How do I value gas produced from leases in an index zone?
####### Valuing residue gas and gas before processing.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (b) explains how you must value the following four types of gas:

(i) Gas production before processing;

(ii) Gas production that you certify on Form ONRR-4410, Certification for Not Performing Accounting for Comparison (Dual Accounting), is not processed before it flows into a pipeline with an index but which may be processed later;

(iii) Residue gas after processing; and

(iv) Gas that is never processed.

(2) The value of gas production that is not sold under an arm's-length dedicated contract is the index-based value determined under paragraph (d) of this section unless the gas was subject to a previous contract which was part of a gas contract settlement. If the previous contract was subject to a gas contract settlement and if the royalty-bearing contract settlement proceeds per MMBtu added to the 80 percent of the safety net prices calculated at § 1206.172(e)(4)(i) exceeds the index-based value that applies to the gas under this section (including any adjustments required under § 1206.176), then the value of the gas is the higher of the value determined under this section (including any adjustments required under § 1206.176) or § 1206.174.

(3) The value of gas production that is sold under an arm's-length dedicated contract is the higher of the index-based value under paragraph (d) of this section or the value of that production determined under § 1206.174(b).
