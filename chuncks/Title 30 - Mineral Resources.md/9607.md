######## Firm demand charges paid to pipelines.

(1)You must limit the allowable costs for the firm demand charges to the applicable rate per MMBtu multiplied by the actual volumes transported. You may not include any losses incurred for previously purchased but unused firm capacity. You also may not include any gains associated with releasing firm capacity. If you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on the Form ONRR-2014. You must modify the Form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period.
