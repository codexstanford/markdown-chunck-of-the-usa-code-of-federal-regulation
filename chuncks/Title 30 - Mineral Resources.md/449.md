###### ยง 18.54 High-voltage continuous mining machines.
####### Onboard ungrounded, three-phase power circuit.

(e)A continuous mining machine designed with an onboard ungrounded, three-phase power circuit must:

(1) Be equipped with a light that will indicate a grounded-phase condition;

(2) Have the indicator light installed so that it can be observed by the operator from any location where the continuous mining machine is normally operated; and

(3) Have a test circuit for the grounded-phase indicator light circuit to assure that the circuit is operating properly. The test circuit must be designed so that, when activated, it does not require removal of any electrical enclosure cover or create a double-phase-to-ground fault.
