() If the Figure 1 limits are used, a seismographic record including both particle-velocity and vibration-frequency levels shall be provided for each blast. The method for the analysis of the predominant frequency contained in the blasting records shall be approved by the regulatory authority before application of this alternative blasting criterion.

(E) The maximum allowable ground vibration shall be reduced by the regulatory authority beyond the limits otherwise provided by this section, if determined necessary to provide damage protection.

(F) The regulatory authority may require an operator to conduct seismic monitoring of any or all blasts and may specify the location at which the measurements are taken and the degree of detail necessary in the measurement.

(iii) If blasting is conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the maximum ground-vibration and airblast standards shall not apply at the following locations:

(A) At structures owned by the permittee and not leased to another person.

(B) At structures owned by the permittee and leased to another person, if a written waiver by the lessee is submitted to the regulatory authority before blasting.
