####### What are the requirements for liquid hydrocarbon royalty meters?

(b)You must:

(1) Ensure that the royalty meter facilities include the following approved components (or other BSEE-approved components) which must be compatible with their connected systems:

(i) A meter equipped with a nonreset totalizer;

(ii) A calibrated mechanical displacement (pipe) prover, master meter, or tank prover;

(iii) A proportional-to-flow sampling device pulsed by the meter output;

(iv) A temperature measurement or temperature compensation device; and

(v) A sediment and water monitor with a probe located upstream of the divert valve.

(2) Ensure that the royalty meter facilities accomplish the following:

(i) Prevent flow reversal through the meter;

(ii) Protect meters subjected to pressure pulsations or surges;

(iii) Prevent the meter from being subjected to shock pressures greater than the maximum working pressure; and

(iv) Prevent meter bypassing.

(3) Maintain royalty meter facilities to ensure the following:

(i) Meters operate within the gravity range specified by the manufacturer;

(ii) Meters operate within the manufacturer's specifications for maximum and minimum flow rate for linear accuracy; and

(iii) Meters are reproven when changes in metering conditions affect the meters' performance such as changes in pressure, temperature, density (water content), viscosity, pressure, and flow rate.

(4) Ensure that sampling devices conform to the following:

(i) The sampling point is in the flowstream immediately upstream or downstream of the meter or divert valve in accordance with the API MPMS (as incorporated by reference in ยง 250.198);

(ii) The sample container is vapor-tight and includes a power mixing device to allow complete mixing of the sample before removal from the container; and

(iii) The sample probe is in the center half of the pipe diameter in a vertical run and is located at least three pipe diameters downstream of any pipe fitting within a region of turbulent flow. The sample probe can be located in a horizontal pipe if adequate stream conditioning such as power mixers or static mixers are installed upstream of the probe according to the manufacturer's instructions.
