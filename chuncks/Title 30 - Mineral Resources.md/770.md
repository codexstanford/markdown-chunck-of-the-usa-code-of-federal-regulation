####### Test procedures.

(c)(1) A 2-quart sample of the fluid shall be poured into the pressure vessel and heated to a temperature of 150 &#xB0;F. The temperature shall be maintained at not less than 145 &#xB0;F. or not more than 155 &#xB0;F. during the test.

(2) Nitrogen shall be introduced into the vessel at 150 p.s.i.g.

(3) The fluid shall be sprayed at each igniting device, described in paragraph (b) (4) of this section, which is moved along the trajectory of the spray. Each igniting device shall be held in the spray at different distances from the nozzle tip for one minute or until the flame or arc is extinguished (if less than one minute) to determine this fire-resistant characteristic of the fluid.
