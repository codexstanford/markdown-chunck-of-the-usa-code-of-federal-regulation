####### Under what circumstances does a liquid hydrocarbon royalty meter need to be taken out of service, and what must I do?

(i)(1) If the difference between the meter factor and the previous factor exceeds 0.0025 it is a malfunction factor, and you must:

(i) Remove the meter from service and inspect it for damage or wear;

(ii) Adjust or repair the meter, and reprove it;

(iii) Apply the average of the malfunction factor and the previous factor to the production measured through the meter between the date of the previous factor and the date of the malfunction factor; and

(iv) Indicate that a meter malfunction occurred and show all appropriate remarks regarding subsequent repairs or adjustments on the proving report.

(2) If a meter fails to register production, you must:

(i) Remove the meter from service, repair and reprove it;

(ii) Apply the previous meter factor to the production run between the date of that factor and the date of the failure; and

(iii) Estimate and report unregistered production on the run ticket.

(3) If the results of a royalty meter proving exceed the run tolerance criteria and all measures excluding the adjustment or repair of the meter cannot bring results within tolerance, you must:

(i) Establish a factor using proving results made before any adjustment or repair of the meter; and

(ii) Treat the established factor like a malfunction factor (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section).
