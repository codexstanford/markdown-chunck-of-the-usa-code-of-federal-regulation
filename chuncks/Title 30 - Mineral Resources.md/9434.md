####### Example 1. Prices in Out Months are Lower Going Forward:

(1)The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December. December was the prompt month (for year 2011) from October 21 through November 18. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. Ptherefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. In this example, assume that P= $95.08 per bbl, P= $95.03 per bbl, and P= $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 x ($95.08-$95.03) + .3333 x ($95.08-$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.
