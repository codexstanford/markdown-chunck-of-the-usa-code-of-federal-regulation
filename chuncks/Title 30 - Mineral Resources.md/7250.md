#### PART 717 - UNDERGROUND MINING GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
##### ยง 717.17 Protection of the hydrologic system.

The permittee shall plan and conduct underground coal mining and reclamation operations to minimize disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balance in order to prevent long-term adverse changes in the hydrologic balance that could result from underground coal mining operations, both on and off site. changes in water quality and quantity, in the depth to ground water, and in the location of surface water drainage channels shall be minimized and applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations shall not be violated. The permittee shall conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The permittee shall emphasize underground coal mining and reclamation practices that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in flows in preference to the use of water treatment facilities prior to discharge to surface waters. Practices to control and minimize pollution include, but are not limited to, diverting water from underground workings or preventing water contact with acid- or toxic-forming materials, and minimizing water contact time with waste materials, maintaining mine barriers to enhance postmining inundation and sealing, establishing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, achieving quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, and lining drainage channels. If treatment is required to eliminate pollution of surface or ground waters, the permittee shall operate and maintain the necessary water treatment facilities as set forth in this section.
