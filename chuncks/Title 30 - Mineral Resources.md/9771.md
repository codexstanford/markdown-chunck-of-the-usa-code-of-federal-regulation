###### ยง 1206.355 How do I calculate royalty due on geothermal resources I sell at arm's length to a purchaser for direct use?

If you sell geothermal resources produced from Class I, II, or III leases at arm's length to a purchaser for direct use, then the royalty on the geothermal resource is the gross proceeds accruing to you from the sale of the geothermal resource to the arm's-length purchaser multiplied by the royalty rate in your lease or that BLM prescribes under 43 CFR 3211.18. See ยง 1206.361 for additional provisions applicable to determining gross proceeds under arm's-length sales.
