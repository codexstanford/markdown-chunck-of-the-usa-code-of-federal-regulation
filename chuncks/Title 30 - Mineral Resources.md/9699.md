###### ยง 1206.174 How do I value gas production when an index-based method cannot be used?
####### Marketable condition/Marketing.

(h)You are required to place gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition and market the gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Indian lessor. When your gross proceeds establish the value under this section, that value must be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services to place the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market the gas, the cost of which ordinarily is your responsibility.
