####### Procedure for flame tests.

(d)(1) The Bunsen burner, retracted from the test position, shall be adjusted to give a blue flame 3 inches in height with natural gas.

(2) The observation door of the gallery shall be closed for the entire test.

(3) The burner flame shall be applied to the free end of the specimen for 1 minute in still air.

(4) At the end of 1 minute the burner flame shall be removed, the ventilating fan turned on to give an air current having a velocity of 300 feet per minute, and the duration of flame measured.

(5) After the test specimen ceases to flame, it shall remain in the air current for at least 3 minutes to determine the presence and duration of afterglow. If a glowing specimen exhibits flame within 3 minutes the duration of flame shall be added to the duration of flame obtained according to paragraph (d) (4) of this section.
