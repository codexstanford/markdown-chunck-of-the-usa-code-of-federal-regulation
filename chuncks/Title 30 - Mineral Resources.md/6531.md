###### Competitive Lease Process
####### § 585.212 What is the process BOEM will follow if there is reason to believe that competitors have withdrawn before the Final Sale Notice is issued?

BOEM may decide to end the competitive process before the Final Sale Notice if we have reason to believe that competitors have withdrawn and competition no longer exists. We will issue a second public notice of Request for Interest and consider comments received to confirm that there is no competitive interest.

(a) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of Request for Interest, BOEM determines that there is no competitive interest in the lease area, and one party wishes to acquire a lease, we will discontinue the competitive process and will proceed with the noncompetitive process set forth in § 585.231(d) through (i) following receipt of the acquisition fee specified in § 585.502(a).

(b) If, after reviewing comments in response to the notice of Request for Interest, BOEM determines that competitive interest in the lease area continues to exist, we will continue with the competitive process set forth in §§ 585.211 through 585.225.
