####### What must I do if a gas meter is out of calibration or malfunctioning?

(d)If a gas meter is out of calibration or malfunctioning, you must:

(1) If the readings are greater than the contractual tolerances, adjust the meter to function properly or remove it from service and replace it.

(2) Correct the volumes to the last acceptable calibration as follows:

(i) If the duration of the error can be determined, calculate the volume adjustment for that period.

(ii) If the duration of the error cannot be determined, apply the volume adjustment to one-half of the time elapsed since the last calibration or 21 days, whichever is less.
