###### Royalty Relief for Pre-Act Deep Water Leases and for Development and Expansion Projects
####### § 203.69 If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?

If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel gas).

(a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes are:

(1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 to 400 meters of water;

(2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and

(3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.

(b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to project wells and replaces the royalty relief, if any, with which we issued your lease.

(c) If your project is economic given the royalty relief with which we issued your lease, we will reject the application.

(d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is necessary for production to be economic.
