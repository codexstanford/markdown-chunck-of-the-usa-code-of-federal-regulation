When your facilities are no longer useful for operations, you must:

You must have two independent barriers, one being an ANSI/API Spec. 11D1 qualified mechanical barrier, in the exposed center wellbore prior to removing the tree and/or well control equipment;

(c) Remove all platforms and other facilities, except as provided in §§ 250.1725(a) and 250.1730.

(d) Decommission all pipelines;

(e) Clear the seafloor of all obstructions created by your lease and pipeline right-of-way operations;

(f) Follow all applicable requirements of subpart G of this part; and

(g) Conduct all decommissioning activities in a manner that is safe, does not unreasonably interfere with other uses of the OCS, and does not cause undue or serious harm or damage to the human, marine, or coastal environment.
