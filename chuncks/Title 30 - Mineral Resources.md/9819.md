##### Subpart A - General Provisions
###### ยง 1208.2 Definitions.
####### Delivery point

means the point where the lessor, in accordance with lease terms, directs the lessee to deliver royalty oil to a purchaser. Title to the royalty oil, or to the quantity thereof in a commingled stream, passes from the Federal Government to the purchaser at this designated point, which is specified in the royalty oil contract. For onshore leases, the delivery point will be on or adjacent to the lease, except as provided in ยง 1208.8(a) of this part. In instances where an onshore delivery point is designated for offshore royalty oil, such point generally will be the first onshore point where the price of the oil, including transportation costs, can be determined and where the purchaser can either exchange or take delivery of the oil. The Government does not guarantee physical access to the oil at such point.
