(1) For the purchase of royalty oil from onshore leases, it means a refiner that qualifies as a small and independent refiner as those terms are defined in sections 3(3) and 3(4) of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, 15 U.S.C. 751except that the time period for determination contained in section 3(3)(A) would be the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of the applicable "Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil." A refiner that, together with all persons controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or otherwise affiliated with the refiner, inputs a volume of domestic crude oil from its own production exceeding 30 percent of its total refinery input of crude oil is ineligible to participate in royalty oil sales under this part. Crude oil received in exchange for such refiner's own production is considered to be that refiner's own production for purposes of this section.

(2) For the purchase of royalty oil from leases on the OCS, it means a refiner that qualifies as a small business enterprise under the rules of the Small Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).
