###### Financial Assurance Requirements for Commercial Leases
####### § 585.515 What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my commercial lease?

(a) Before BOEM will issue your commercial lease or approve an assignment of an existing commercial lease, you (or, for an assignment, the proposed assignee) must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease by providing either:

(1) A $100,000 minimum, lease-specific bond; or

(2) Another approved financial assurance instrument guaranteeing performance up to $100,000, as specified in §§ 585.526 through 585.529.

(b) You meet the financial assurance requirements under this subpart if your designated lease operator provides a $100,000 minimum, lease-specific bond or other approved financial assurance that guarantees compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease.

(1) The dollar amount of the minimum, lease-specific financial assurance in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section will be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) or a substantially equivalent index if the CPI-U is discontinued; and

(2) The first CPI-U-based adjustment can be made no earlier than the 5-year anniversary of the adoption of this rule. Subsequent CPI-U-based adjustments may be made every 5 years thereafter.
