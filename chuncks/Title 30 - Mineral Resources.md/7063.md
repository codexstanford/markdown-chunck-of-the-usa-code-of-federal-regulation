For example, the 10-year 24-hour precipitation event would be that 24-hour precipitation event expected to be exceeded on the average once in 10 years. Magnitude of such events are as defined by the National Weather Service Technical Paper No. 40, "Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the U.S.," May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or rainfall probability information developed therefrom.
