(1)The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December 2012. December was the prompt month from October 23 through November 20. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. Ptherefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. In this example, assume that P= $95.08 per bbl; P= $95.03 per bbl; and P= $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 x ($95.08-$95.03) + .3333 x ($95.08-$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.
