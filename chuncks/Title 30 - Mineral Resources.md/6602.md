###### Financial Assurance for Limited Leases, ROW Grants, and RUE Grants
####### § 585.520 What financial assurance must I provide when I obtain my limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant?

(a) Before BOEM will issue your limited lease, ROW grant, or RUE grant, you or a proposed assignee must guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the lease or grant by providing either:

(1) A $300,000 minimum, lease- or grant-specific bond; or

(2) Another approved financial assurance instrument of such minimum level as specified in §§ 585.526 through 585.529.

(b) You meet the financial assurance requirements under this subpart if your designated lease or grant operator provides a minimum limited lease-specific or grant-specific bond in an amount sufficient to guarantee compliance with all terms and conditions of the limited lease or grant.

(1) The dollar amount of the minimum, lease- or grant-specific financial assurance in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be adjusted to reflect changes in the CPI-U or a substantially equivalent index if the CPI-U is discontinued; and

(2) The first CPI-U-based adjustment can be made no earlier than the 5-year anniversary of the adoption of this rule. Subsequent CPI-U-based adjustments may be made every 5 years thereafter.
