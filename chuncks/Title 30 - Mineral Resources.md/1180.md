####### Abrasion.

(1)(i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning a wound, soaking, applying antiseptic and nonprescription medication and bandages on the first visit and follow-up visits limited to observation including changing dressing and bandages. Additional cleaning and application of antiseptic constitutes first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.

(ii) Medical treatment includes examination for removal of imbedded foreign material, multiple soakings, whirlpool treatment, treatment of infection, or other professional treatments and any treatment involving more than a minor spot-type injury. Treatment of abrasions occurring to greater than full skin depth is considered medical treatment.
