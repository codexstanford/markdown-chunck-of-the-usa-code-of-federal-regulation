###### ยง 1206.113 What adjustments and transportation allowances apply when I value oil production from my lease using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices?
####### Example 3.

(3)Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Bakersfield, California. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Hynes Station and then exchanges the oil to Cushing, which it further exchanges with oil that it refines. Assume that the ANS spot price is $105.65/bbl and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Bakersfield to Hynes Station is $0.28/bbl. The lessee must request approval from ONRR for a location and quality adjustment between Hynes Station and Long Beach. For example, the lessee likely would propose using the tariff on Line 63 from Hynes Station to Long Beach as the adjustment between those points. Assume that adjustment to be $0.72, including the sulfur and gravity bank adjustments, and that ONRR approves the lessee's request. In this example, the preliminary (because the location and quality adjustment is subject to ONRR's review) royalty value of the oil is $105.65 -$0.72 -$0.28 = $104.65/bbl. The fact that oil was exchanged to Cushing does not change the use of ANS spot prices for royalty valuation.
