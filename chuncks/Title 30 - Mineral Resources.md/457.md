(1) For values not included in the table, the following formulas, on which the table is based, may be used to determine the minimum free distance.

(i) Steel Wall/Cover:

(ii) Aluminum Wall/Cover:

(2) The minimum free distance must be increased by 1.5 inches for 4,160 volt systems and 0.7 inches for 2,400 volt systems when the adjacent wall area is the top of the enclosure. If a steel shield is mounted in conjunction with an aluminum wall or cover, the thickness of the steel shield is used to determine the minimum free distances.
