###### ยง 1208.4 Royalty oil sales to eligible refiners.
####### Interim sales.

(d)The ONRR generally will not conduct interim sales. However, interim sales may be held at the discretion of the Secretary if substantial addition royalty oil becomes available. The potentially eligible refiners, individually or collectively, must submit documentation demonstrating that adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices are not available for purchase. Although sufficient documentation must be submitted, it is not mandatory for each potentially eligible refiner to participate in a submission of such documentation to be determined eligible. The documentation must be submitted to ONRR for a determination as to whether an interim sale is needed.
