####### Example 2. Prices in Out Months are Higher Going Forward:

(2)The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November. November was the prompt month (for year 2012) from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. Ptherefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. Pis the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P= $91.28 per bbl, P= $91.65 per bbl, and P= $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 x ($91.28-$91.65) + .3333 x ($91.28-$92.10) = (-$0.25) + (-$0.27) = (-$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively, a subtraction from the NYMEX price).
