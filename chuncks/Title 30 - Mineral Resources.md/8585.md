(e) If you conduct a coal reclamation project under part 874 of this chapter or noncoal reclamation project under part 875 of this chapter, you must not expend any construction funds until you receive a written authorization from us to proceed on an individual project. Our authorization to proceed ensures that both you and we have taken all actions necessary to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321) and any other applicable laws, clearances, permits, or requirements.

(f) To the extent technologically and economically feasible, you must use fuel other than petroleum or natural gas for all public facilities that are planned, constructed, or modified in whole or in part with Title IV grant funds.

(g) You must not expend more funds than we have awarded. Our award of any grant does not commit or obligate the United States to award any continuation grant or to enter into any grant revision, including grant increases to cover cost overruns.
