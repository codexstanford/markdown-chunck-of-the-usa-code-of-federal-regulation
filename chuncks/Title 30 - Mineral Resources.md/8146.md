For an impoundment meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR-60, or the size or other criteria of ยง 77.216(a) of this title, foundation investigation, as well as any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, shall be performed to determine the design requirements for foundation stability.

(7) Slope protection shall be provided to protect against surface erosion at the site and protect against sudden drawdown.

(8) Faces of embankments and surrounding areas shall be vegetated, except that faces where water is impounded may be riprapped or otherwise stabilized in accordance with accepted design practices.
