######## i.e.,

(iv) All parameters associated with the subsea pump operation (e.g., pump temperature high, pump vibration high, pump suction pressure high, pump discharge pressure high, pump suction flow low) must be cleared (within operational limits) or continuously monitored by personnel who observe visual indicators displayed at a designated control station and have the capability to initiate shut-in action in the event of an abnormal condition.

(3) Monitor the separator for seawater.

(4) Ensure that the subsea pump systems are controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system.

(d) Follow the valve closure times and hydraulic bleed requirements according to your approved DWOP for the following:

(1) Electro-hydraulic control system with a subsea pump;

(2) A loss of communication with the subsea well(s) and not a loss of communication with the subsea pump control system without an ESD or sensor activation;

(3) A loss of communication with the subsea pump control system, and not a loss of communication with the subsea well(s);

(4) A loss of communication with the subsea well(s) and the subsea pump control system.

(e) For subsea pump testing:

(1) Perform a complete subsea pump function test, including full shutdown, after any intervention or changes to the software and equipment affecting the subsea pump; and

(2) Test the subsea pump shutdown, including PSHL sensors both upstream and downstream of the pump, each quarter (not to exceed 120 days between tests). This testing may be performed concurrently with the ESD function test required by ยง 250.880(c)(4)(v).
