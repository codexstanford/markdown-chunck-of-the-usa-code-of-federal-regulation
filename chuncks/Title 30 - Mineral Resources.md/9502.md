####### Reporting requirements.

(b)(1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. You must provide the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.

(2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allotted leases and with lessor approval on Tribal leases.

(3) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
