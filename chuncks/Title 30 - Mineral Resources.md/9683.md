####### What leases this section applies to.

(a)This section explains how lessees must value, for royalty purposes, gas produced from Indian leases located in an index zone. For other leases, value must be determined under ยง 1206.174.

(1) You must use the valuation provision of this section if your lease is in an index zone and meets one of the following two requirements:

(i) Has a major portion provision;

(ii) Does not have a major portion provision, but provides for the Secretary to determine the value of production.

(2) This section does not apply to carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other non-hydrocarbon components of the gas stream. However, if they are recovered and sold separately from the gas stream, you must determine the value of these products under ยง 1206.174.
