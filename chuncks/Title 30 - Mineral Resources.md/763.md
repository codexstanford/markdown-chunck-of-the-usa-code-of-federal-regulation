####### Furnace.

(5)The furnace in which the ignition-temperature test is conducted shall consist of a refractory (alundum or equivalent) cylinder 5 inches in internal diameter and 5 inches in height; a transite-ring top and a transite-disk bottom, each of which is attached to a metal cylinder. The furnace is heated by three elements as follows: (i) A circumferential heater embedded in the refractory cylinder; (ii) a top or toroidal-neck heater that surrounds the neck of the test flask; and (iii) a flat base heater on which the test flask rests. The temperature of each heating element shall be controlled independently by an autotransformer. Means shall be provided for applying thermocouples at the neck, mid-section, and base of the test flask, which shall be inserted upright in the furnace.
