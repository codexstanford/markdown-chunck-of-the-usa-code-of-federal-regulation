###### § 1206.153 How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?
####### Firm demand charges paid to pipelines.

(1)You may deduct firm demand charges or capacity reservation fees that you or your affiliate paid to a pipeline, including charges or fees for unused firm capacity that you or your affiliate have not sold before you report your allowance. If you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment from any party for release or sale of firm capacity after reporting a transportation allowance that included the cost of that unused firm capacity, or if you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on form ONRR-2014 by the amount of that payment. You must modify form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period and pay any resulting royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
