##### ยง 717.14 Backfilling and grading of road cuts, mine entry area cuts, and other surface work areas.
###### Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and other

(e)waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste material for fill. Any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible materials, or any other waste materials as identified by the regulatory authority that are exposed, used, or produced during underground mining and which are deposited on the land surface shall, after placement in accordance with ยง 717.15 of this part, be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible material; or, if necessary, treated to neutralize toxicity, in order to prevent water pollution and sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth and land uses. Where necessary to protect against upward migration of salts, exposure by erosion, to provide an adequate depth for plant growth, or to otherwise meet local conditions, the regulatory authority shall specify thicker amount of cover using nontoxic material. Acid-forming or toxic-forming material shall not be buried or stored in proximity to a drainage course so as to cause or pose a threat of water pollution or otherwise violate the provisions of ยง 717.17 of this part.
