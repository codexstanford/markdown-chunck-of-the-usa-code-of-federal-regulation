###### Interpretation of § 784.15: Reclamation plan: Postmining land uses.

(a)(1) The requirements of § 784.15(a)(2), for approval of an alternative postmining land use, may be met by requesting approval through the permit revision procedures of § 774.13 rather than requesting such approval in the original permit application. The original permit application, however, must demonstrate that the land will be returned to its premining land use capability as required by § 817.133(a). An application for a permit revision of this type, (i) must be submitted in accordance with the filing deadlines of § 774.13, (ii) shall constitute a significant alteration from the mining operations contemplated by the original permit, and (iii) shall be subject to the requirements of 30 CFR parts 773 and 775.

(b) [Reserved]
