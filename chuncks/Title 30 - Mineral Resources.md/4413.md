####### ยง 250.713 What must I provide if I plan to use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) for well operations?
######## Dynamically positioned MODU.

(e)If you use a dynamically positioned MODU, you must include in your APD or APM your contingency plan for moving off location in an emergency situation. At a minimum, your plan must address emergency events caused by storms, currents, station-keeping failures, power failures, and losses of well control. The District Manager may require your plan to include additional events that may require movement of the MODU and other information needed to clarify or further address how the MODU will respond to emergencies or other events.
