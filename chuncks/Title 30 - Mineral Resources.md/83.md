The insulation thickness shall be representative of that used on the battery box and cover. If the insulation material and thickness of material are identical for the battery box and cover, only one sample need be prepared and tested.

(2) Prepare a 30 percent solution of sulfuric acid (HSO) by mixing 853 ml of water with 199 ml of sulfuric acid (HSO) with a specific gravity of 1.84. Completely cover the samples with the acid solution at the test temperature range of 65 &#xB0;F-80 &#xB0;F (18.3 &#xB0;C-26.7 &#xB0;C) and maintain these conditions for 7 days.
