####### www.onrr.gov

(ii) If you can transport gas to more than one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at, your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for the index pricing points to which your gas could be transported for the production month, whether or not there are constraints for that production month.

(iii) If there are sequential index pricing points on a pipeline, you must use the first index pricing point at or after your gas enters the pipeline.

(iv) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section by 5 percent for sales from the OCS Gulf of Mexico and by 10 percent for sales from all other areas, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu.
