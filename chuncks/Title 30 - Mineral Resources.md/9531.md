###### ยง 1206.113 What adjustments and transportation allowances apply when I value oil production from my lease using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices?
####### Example 1.

(1)Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Artesia, New Mexico. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Roswell, New Mexico, and then exchanges the oil to Midland, Texas. Assume that the lessee refines the oil received in exchange at Midland. Assume that the NYMEX price is $86.21/bbl, adjusted for the roll; that the WTI differential (Cushing to Midland) is-$2.27/bbl; that the lessee's exchange agreement between Roswell and Midland results in a location and quality differential of-$0.08/bbl; and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Artesia to Roswell is $0.40/bbl. In this example, the royalty value of the oil is $86.21-$2.27-$0.08-$0.40 = $83.46/bbl.
