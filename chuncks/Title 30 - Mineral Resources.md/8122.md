###### Surface-water protection.

(d)In order to protect the hydrologic balance, underground mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under ยง 784.14(g) of this chapter, and the following:

(1) Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the permit area; and otherwise prevent water pollution. If drainage control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not adequate to meet the requirements of this section and ยง 817.42, the operator shall use and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities or water quality controls.

(2) Surface-water quantity and flow rates shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps outlined in the plan approved under ยง 784.14(g) of this chapter.
