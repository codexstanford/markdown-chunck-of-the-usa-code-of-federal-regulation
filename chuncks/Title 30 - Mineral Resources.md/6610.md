####### ยง 585.529 Can I use a lease- or grant-specific decommissioning account to meet the financial assurance requirements related to decommissioning?

(a) In lieu of a surety bond, BOEM may authorize you to establish a lease-, ROW grant-, or RUE grant-specific decommissioning account in a federally insured institution. The funds may not be withdrawn from the account without our written approval.

(1) The funds must be payable to BOEM and pledged to meet your lease or grant decommissioning and site clearance obligations; and

(2) You must fully fund the account within the time BOEM prescribes to cover all costs of decommissioning including site clearance. BOEM will estimate the cost of decommissioning, including site clearance.

(b) Any interest paid on the account will be treated as account funds unless we authorize in writing that any interest be paid to the depositor.
