###### Indicating detectors.

(2)Indicating detectors shall give indications of as low as 0.25 percent methane. Detectors having an upper scale limit of 2 percent may be approved, but it is recommended that the detector be designed to give indications of as high as 4 percent methane. The indications for these percentages shall be within the limits of error specified in the following table:

(i) Tests shall be made at several percentages within the range of the indicating detector and at temperatures between the limits of 50&#xB0; and 70 &#xB0;F. by increments of 5&#xB0;. Ten determinations shall be made at each percentage. Neither the average of the 10 readings nor more than 2 readings for each percentage shall exceed the limits of error given in the table.

(ii) The average number of determinations that may be made with an indicating detector without replacement of any part shall be not less than 30, and the average number that may be made without recharging the battery shall be not less than 15.

(iii) The scale shall not be subdivided into smaller divisions than the general accuracy of the indicating detector warrants.
