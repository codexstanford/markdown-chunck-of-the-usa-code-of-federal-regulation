####### What are the requirements for liquid hydrocarbon allocation meters?

(k)For liquid hydrocarbon allocation meters you must:

(1) Take samples continuously proportional to flow or daily (use the procedure in the applicable chapter of the API MPMS as incorporated by reference in ยง 250.198;

(2) For turbine meters, take the sample proportional to the flow only;

(3) Prove operating allocation meters monthly if they measure 50 or more barrels per day per meter the previous month. When a force majeure event precludes the required monthly meter proving, meters must be proved within 15 days after being returned to service. The meters must be proved monthly thereafter; or

(4) Prove operating allocation meters quarterly if they measure less than 50 barrels per day per meter the previous month. When a force majeure event precludes the required quarterly meter proving, meters must be proved within 15 days after being returned to service. The meters must be proved quarterly thereafter;

(5) Keep a copy of the proving reports at the field location for 2 years;

(6) Adjust and reprove the meter if the meter factor differs from the previous meter factor by more than 2 percent and less than 7 percent;

(7) For turbine meters, remove from service, inspect and reprove the meter if the factor differs from the previous meter factor by more than 2 percent and less than 7 percent;

(8) Repair and reprove, or replace and prove the meter if the meter factor differs from the previous meter factor by 7 percent or more; and

(9) Permit BSEE representatives to witness provings.
