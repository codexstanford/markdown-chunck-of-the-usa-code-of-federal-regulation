###### ยง 556.702 When will my assignment result in a segregated lease?

(a) When there is an assignment by all record title owners of 100 percent of the record title to one or more aliquots in a lease, the assigned and retained portions become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such case, both the new lease and the remaining portion of the original lease are referred to as "segregated leases" and the assignee(s) becomes the record title owner(s) of the new lease, which is subject to all the terms and conditions of the original lease.
