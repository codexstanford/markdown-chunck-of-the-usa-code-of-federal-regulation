####### ยง 585.655 What activities require a revision to my GAP, and when will BOEM approve the revision?

(a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved GAP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing GAP or require a revision to your GAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.

(b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved GAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your GAP. If the review indicates that the GAP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, BOEM will require you to submit the needed revisions.

(c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your GAP will likely be necessary include:

(1) Activities not described in your approved GAP;

(2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;

(3) Change in the surface location of a facility or structure;

(4) Addition of a facility or structure not contemplated in your approved GAP;
