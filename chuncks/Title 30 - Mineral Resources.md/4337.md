######## What must I do in the event of a kick?

(n)In the event of a kick, you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:

(1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and pumping the fluids back into the formation.

(2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP system, and related equipment). The disposal of HS and other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of HS. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize HS and restore and maintain the proper quality.
