##### ยง 1220.034 Redetermination and appeals.

(a) If, as a result of an inspection of records or an audit under ยง 1220.033, the ONRR Director determines that there is an error in the NPSL capital account or an error in calculating the net profit share payment, whether in favor of the government or the lessee, the ONRR Director shall redetermine the net profit share base and recalculate the net profit share payment due the United States and notify the lessee of the recalculation.

(b) The lessee shall pay any additional amount of net profit share payment owed plus interest, compounded monthly, from the date that the payment was due until the date it is actually paid. Interest shall be calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as published in the Bulletin to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, in effect for the period or periods over which the payment is owed.

(c) If the recalculated profit share payment is less than the amount paid the United States, the lessee shall apply such overpayment to the next profit share payment.

(d) Within 30 days after receiving notice of the recalculation as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the lessee may appeal the decision of the ONRR Director in accordance with the appeals provision of 30 CFR part 1290.
