####### Original well

means a well that is drilled without utilizing an existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from the original wellbore either before the drilling rig moves off the well location or after a temporary rig move that BSEE agrees was forced by a weather or safety threat and drilling resumes within 1 year. A bypass from an original well (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the original well.
