####### What are the requirements for calibrating a master meter used in royalty meter provings?

(e)You must:

(1) Calibrate the master meter to obtain a master meter factor before using it to determine operating meter factors;

(2) Use a fluid of similar gravity, viscosity, temperature, and flow rate as the liquid hydrocarbons that flow through the operating meter to calibrate the master meter;

(3) Calibrate the master meter monthly, but the time between calibrations must not exceed 42 days;

(4) Calibrate the master meter by recording runs until the results of two consecutive runs (if a tank prover is used) or five out of six consecutive runs (if a mechanical-displacement prover is used) produce meter factor differences of no greater than 0.0002. Lessees must use the average of the two (or the five) runs that produced acceptable results to compute the master meter factor;

(5) Install the master meter upstream of any back-pressure or reverse flow check valves associated with the operating meter. However, the master meter may be installed either upstream or downstream of the operating meter; and

(6) Keep a copy of the master meter calibration report at your field location for 2 years.
