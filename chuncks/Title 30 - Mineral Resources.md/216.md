###### ยง 7.306 Explosion tests.

(a) The following shall be used for conducting an explosion test:

(1) An explosion test chamber designed and constructed to contain an explosive gas mixture to surround and fill the motor assembly being tested. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the motor assembly.

(2) A methane gas supply with at least 98 by volume per centum of combustible hydrocarbons, with the remainder being inert. At least 80 percent by volume of the gas shall be methane.

(3) Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series.

(4) An electric spark ignition source with a minimum of 100 millijoules of energy.

(5) A pressure recording system that will indicate the pressure peaks resulting from the ignition and combustion of explosive gas mixtures within the enclosure being tested.
