##### ยง 19.6 Specific requirements for approval.
###### Angle of light beam.

(b)MSHA recommends that the angle of the light beam be at least 130 degrees horizontally to insure that the contrast edge of the beam is away from the more sensitive sector of the wearer's vision; however, to allow for manufacturing and assembly tolerances and the use of multiple filament bulbs, MSHA will approve lamps giving a minimum beam angle of 120 degrees. If the bulb has more than one major filament, the one giving the smaller angle will be used in the determination.
