####### Processing

means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing. The use of a Joule-Thomson (JT) unit to remove NGLs from gas is considered processing regardless of where the JT unit is located, provided that you market the NGLs as NGLs.
