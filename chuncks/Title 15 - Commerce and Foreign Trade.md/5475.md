###### ยง 774.1 Introduction.
####### Scope of the control list.

(a)In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes "items"-i.e., "commodities," "software," and "technology"-subject to the authority of BIS. The CCL does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL may contain a reference to such controls. In addition, those items "subject to the EAR" but not identified on the CCL are identified by the designator "EAR99." See ยง 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are "subject to the EAR." EAR Part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.
