###### Burden of proof.

(8)Commerce entities will have the initial burden to prove the existence and amount of the Commerce debt. Thereafter, if the employee disputes the existence or amount of the Commerce debt, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no such Commerce debt exists or that the amount of the Commerce debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of the Commerce debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
