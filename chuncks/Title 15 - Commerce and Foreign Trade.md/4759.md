##### PART 762 - RECORDKEEPING
###### § 762.1 Scope.
####### Transactions subject to this part.

(a)The recordkeeping provisions of this part apply to the following transactions:

(1) Transactions involving restrictive trade practices or boycotts described in part 760 of the EAR;

(2) Exports of commodities, software, or technology from the United States and any known reexports, transfers (in-country), transshipment, or diversions of items exported from the United States;

(3) Exports to Canada, if, at any stage in the transaction, it appears that a person in a country other than the United States or Canada has an interest therein, or that the item involved is to be reexported, transshipped, or diverted from Canada to another foreign country; or

(4) Any other transactions subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to, the prohibitions against servicing, forwarding and other actions for or on behalf of end-users of proliferation concern contained in §§ 736.2(b)(7) and 744.6 of the EAR. This part also applies to all negotiations connected with those transactions, except that for export control matters a mere preliminary inquiry or offer to do business and negative response thereto shall not constitute negotiations, unless the inquiry or offer to do business proposes a transaction that a reasonably prudent exporter would believe likely to lead to a violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.
