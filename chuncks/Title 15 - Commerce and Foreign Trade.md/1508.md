###### ยง 200.107 WWV-WWVH-WWVB broadcasts.
####### WWVB.

(l)This station (antenna coordinates 40&#xB0;40&#x2032;28.3&#x2033; N., 105&#xB0;02&#x2032;39.5&#x2033; W.; radiated power 12 kw.) broadcasts on 60 kHz. Its time scale is the same as for WWV and WWVH, and its frequency accuracy and stability are the same. Its entire format consists of a 1 pulse per second special binary time code giving minutes, hours, days, and the correction between its UTC time scale and UTI astronomical time. Identification of WWVB is made by its unique time code and a 45&#xB0; carrier phase shift which occurs for the period between 10 minutes and 15 minutes after each hour. The useful coverage area of WWVB is within the continental United States. Propagation fluctuations are much less with WWVB than with high-frequency reception, permitting frequency comparisons to be made to a few parts in 10per day.
