####### Certificate of origin.

A.A certificate of origin is to be issued by the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by the exporting country, attesting that the goods exported to the boycotting country are of purely indigenous origin, and stating the name of the factory or the manufacturing company. To the extent that the goods as described on the certificate of origin are not solely and exclusively products of their country of origin indicated thereon, a declaration must be appended to the certificate of origin giving the name of the supplier/manufacturer and declaring:

"The undersigned, ______, does hereby declare on behalf of the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts or components of the goods described in the attached certificate of origin are the products of such country or countries, other than the country named therein as specifically indicated hereunder:

Sworn to before me, this ____ day of ______, 20__. Notary Seal."

It is the Department's position that furnishing a positive certificate of origin, such as the one set out above, falls within the exception contained in ยง 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See ยง 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder.
