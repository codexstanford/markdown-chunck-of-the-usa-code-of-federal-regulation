####### Authorization for commencement of an activity on an interim basis.

(d)For an activity notified pursuant to ยง 400.14(a), the Executive Secretary may authorize the commencement of some or all of the activity on an interim basis. Such authorization shall only be made based on a showing that commencement of the activity is time-sensitive, with such showing to include comments from CBP that specifically address the projected timeframe for commencement of the activity. Interim authorization shall not apply to materials or components subject to an AD/CVD order or proceeding or suspension of liquidation under AD/CVD procedures. As warranted, a determination that further review is needed for all or some of the notified activity pursuant to ยง 400.37(c) may also revoke the interim authorization until the Board makes a determination after conduct of that further review.
