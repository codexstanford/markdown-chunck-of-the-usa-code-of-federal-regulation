##### PART 760 - RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES OR BOYCOTTS
###### Supplement No. 6 to Part 760 - Interpretation
####### Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country.

(c)This term appears from time-to-time in letters of credit and shipping documents from Saudi Arabia. In our view, it is neither prohibited, nor reportable because it is not boycott-related. There is a wide range of symbols that are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for a variety of reasons, many having to do with that nation's cultural and religious beliefs. On this basis, we do not interpret the term to be boycott related. See ยง 760.2(a)(5) and ยง 760.5(a)(5)(v) of this part.
