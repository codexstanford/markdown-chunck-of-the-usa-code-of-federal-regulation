###### ยง 758.4 Use of export license.
####### Shipments against expiring license.

(b)Any item requiring a license that has not departed from the final U.S. port of export by midnight of the expiration date on an export license may not be exported under that license unless the shipment meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) BIS grants an extension; or

(2) Prior to midnight on the date of expiration on the license, the items:

(i) Were laden aboard the vessel;

(ii) Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage, and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or

(iii) The vessel was expected to be at the pier for loading before the license expired, but exceptional and unforseen circumstances delayed it, and BIS or the U.S. Customs Service makes a judgment that undue hardship would result if a license extension were required.
