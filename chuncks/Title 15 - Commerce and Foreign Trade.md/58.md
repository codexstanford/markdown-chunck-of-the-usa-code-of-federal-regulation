###### Description of records sought.

(c)(1) A FOIA request must reasonably describe the agency records sought, to enable Department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.

(2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number, and the name and location of the office where the record(s) might be found.

(i) In addition, if records about a court case are sought, the title of the case, the court in which the case was filed, and the nature of the case should be included.

(ii) If known, any file designations or descriptions of the requested records should be included.

(iii) As a general rule, the more specifically the request describes the records sought, the greater the likelihood that the Department will be able to locate those records.
