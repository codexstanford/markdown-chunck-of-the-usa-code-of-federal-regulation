###### Supplement No. 1 to Part 705 - Requirements for Submissions Requesting Exclusions From the Adjustment of Imports of Aluminum and Steel Imposed Pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as Amended
####### Not produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount.

(i)The exclusion review criterion "Not produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount" means that the amount that is needed by the end user requesting the exclusion is not available immediately in the United States to meet its specified business activities. Available "immediately" means that a product (whether it is currently being produced in the United States, or could be produced in the United States) can be delivered by a U.S. producer "within eight weeks", or, if that is not possible, by a date earlier than the time required for the requester to obtain the entire quantity of the product from the requester's foreign supplier. Furthermore, to the extent that an objector can produce and deliver a portion, which is less than 100 percent, but ten percent or more, of the amount of steel or aluminum needed in the business activities of the user in the United States described in the exclusion request, the Department of Commerce may deny a requested exclusion for that percentage of imported steel or aluminum. It is incumbent upon both the exclusion requester, and objecting producers, to provide supplemental evidence supporting their claimed delivery times.
