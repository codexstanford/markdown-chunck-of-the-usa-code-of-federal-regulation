(2) The UVL statement must be in writing, signed and dated by an individual of sufficient authority to legally bind the UVL party, and state the following:

(i) Name of UVL party; complete physical address, to include shipping, corporate, and end user addresses, if different (simply listing a post office box is insufficient); telephone number; fax number; email address; Web site (if available); and name and title of individual signing the UVL statement.

(ii) Agrees not to use the item(s) for any use prohibited by the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-772, and agrees not to reexport or transfer (in-country) the item(s) to any destination, use or user prohibited by the EAR.

(v) Agrees to provide copies of this document and all other export, reexport or transfer (in-country) records required to be retained in part 762 of the EAR.
