###### Decision.

(a)In deciding whether to authorize a demand for testimony or documents under this subpart, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel shall consider whether the disclosure or testimony is in the interests of the Department. The following factors should be considered:

(1) Conserving the time of Department employees for conducting official business;

(2) Minimizing the possibility of involving the Department in controversial issues that are not related to the Department's mission or matters that do not further the Department's mission;

(3) Preventing the possibility that the public will misconstrue variances between personal opinions of Department employees and official Department policy;

(4) Avoiding spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes;

(5) Preserving the integrity of the administrative or judicial process;

(6) Protecting classified, confidential, or controlled unclassified information, and the deliberative process of the Department;

(7) Preventing the appearance of improperly favoring one litigant over another;

(8) Avoiding the denial of a party's constitutional or statutory rights;

(9) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;

(10) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege; and

(11) Any other issue that is relevant to the decision.
