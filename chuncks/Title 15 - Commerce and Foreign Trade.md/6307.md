##### PART 784 - COMPLEMENTARY ACCESS
###### ยง 784.1 Complementary access: General information on the purpose of complementary access, affected locations, and the role of BIS.
####### Other locations specified in the U.S. declaration and locations requested by the IAEA that are not included in the U.S. declaration as agreed to by the U.S. Government.

(2)Complementary access may be conducted at other locations specified in the U.S. declaration (i.e., locations required to submit reports to BIS pursuant to ยง 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), and locations requested by the IAEA and agreed to by the U.S. Government, to resolve questions relating to the correctness and completeness of the information provided in the U.S. declaration or to resolve inconsistencies relating to that information.

(i) In the event that the IAEA has a question about, or identifies an apparent inconsistency in, information contained in the U.S. declaration (e.g., information based on reports submitted to BIS by one of these locations, pursuant to ยง 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), the IAEA will provide the U.S. Government with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency. The IAEA will not draw any conclusions about the question or inconsistency, or request complementary access to a location, until the U.S. Government has been provided with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency, unless the IAEA considers that a delay in access would prejudice the purpose for which the access is sought.
