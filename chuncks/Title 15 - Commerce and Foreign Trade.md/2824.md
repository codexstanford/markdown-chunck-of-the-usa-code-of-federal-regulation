###### ยง 713.2 Annual declaration requirements for plant sites that produce, process or consume Schedule 2 chemicals in excess of specified thresholds.
####### Determining declaration requirements for production, processing and consumption.,1,3

(iii)If the total quantity of a Schedule 2 chemical produced, processed or consumed at a plant on your plant site, including mixtures that contain 30% or more concentration of a Schedule 2 chemical, exceeds the applicable declaration threshold set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A)() through () of this section, you have a declaration requirement. For example, if during calendar year 2001, a plant on your plant site produced a mixture containing 300 kilograms of thiodiglycol in a concentration of 32% and also produced 800 kilograms of thiodiglycol, the total amount of thiodiglycol produced at that plant for CWCR purposes would be 1100 kilograms, which exceeds the declaration threshold of 1 metric ton for that Schedule 2 chemical. You must declare past production of thiodiglycol at that plant site for calendar year 2001. If, on the other hand, a plant on your plant site processed a mixture containing 300 kilograms of thiodiglycol in a concentration of 25% and also processed 800 kilograms of thiodiglycol in other than mixture form, the total amount of thiodiglycol processed at that plant for CWCR purposes would be 800 kilograms and would not trigger a declaration requirement. This is because the concentration of thiodiglycol in the mixture is less than 30% and therefore did not have to be "counted" and added to the other 800 kilograms of processed thiodiglycol at that plant.
