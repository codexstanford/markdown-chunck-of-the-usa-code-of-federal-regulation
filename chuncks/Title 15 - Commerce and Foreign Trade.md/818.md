##### ยง 19.12 How will Commerce entities offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a Commerce debt?
###### Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence.

(7)In the absence of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary evidence as required for a paper hearing, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. Further, the employee will have been deemed to admit the existence and amount of the Commerce debt as described in the notice of intent to offset. If the Commerce entity representative fails to appear at an oral hearing, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties.
