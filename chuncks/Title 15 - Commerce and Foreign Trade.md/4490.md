####### Reexports.

(l)If you know that an item that requires a license to be exported from the United States to a certain foreign destination will be reexported to a third destination also requiring approval, such a request must be included on the license application. The license application must specify the country to which the reexport will be made in Block 24. If the export does not require a license but the reexport does, you may apply for a license for the reexport, or you may export without a license and notify the consignee of the requirement to seek a license to reexport.
