####### CCATS response.

(4)The BIS response to the CCATS request will reflect the interagency consensus determination and the response will be made in accordance with the procedures in §§ 748.1 and 748.3(b). In addition, the BIS response will indicate one of the following:

(i) The "part," "component," "accessory," "attachment," or "software" is not "specially designed" on the basis of being within the scope of paragraph (b)(3) because the changes in form and fit have been determined by the U.S. Government to be minor or insignificant. In such cases, the new classification, which may be EAR99 or in another ECCN entry that does not use "specially designed," will be provided as part of the BIS response;"

(ii) The request under § 748.3(e) has been denied and the "part," "component," "accessory," "attachment," or "software" continues to be classified under a "specially designed" 'catch-all' (see the definition of "specially designed" in § 772.1 of the EAR). The response will also include a determination regarding where the "specially designed" "part," "component," "accessory," "attachment," or "software" is classified on the CCL; or

(iii) Returned without action (RWA) because insufficient information was provided or information was not provided in a timely fashion. These requests will be reviewed closely, and they will likely require additional follow up questions of applicants, so responding to such requests in a timely fashion will be an important part of the process to ensure such requests are considered by the U.S. Government.
