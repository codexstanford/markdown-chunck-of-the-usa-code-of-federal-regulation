####### Authorization to retain commodity abroad at launch country beyond six months.

(ii)If, after the commodity is exported or reexported under this authorization, a delay occurs in the launch schedule that would exceed the 6-month deadline in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the exporter or reexporter or the person in control of the commodities in the launch country may request a one-time 6-month extension by submitting written notification to BIS requesting a 6-month extension and noting the reason for the delay. If the requestor is not contacted by BIS within 30 days from the date of the postmark of the written notification and if the notification meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the request is deemed granted. The request must be sent to BIS at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR and should include the name and address of the exporter or reexporter, the name and address of the person who has control of the commodity, the date the commodities were exported or reexported, a brief product description, and the justification for the extension.
