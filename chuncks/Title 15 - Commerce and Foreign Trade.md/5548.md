c. Ceramic composite materials (dielectric constant is less than 6 at any frequency from 100 MHz to 100 GHz) for use in radomes useable in rockets, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of achieving a "range" equal to or greater than 300 km;

d. High-temperature ceramic materials, useable in rockets, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of achieving a "range" equal to or greater than 300 km, as follows:

d.1. Bulk machinable silicon-carbide reinforced unfired ceramic, usable for nose tips.

d.2. Reinforced silicon-carbide ceramic composites usable for nose tips, re-entry vehicles, nozzle flaps.

d.3. Bulk machinable ceramic composite materials consisting of an 'Ultra High Temperature Ceramic (UHTC)' matrix with a melting point equal to or greater than 3000 &#xB0;C and reinforced with fibers or filaments, usable for missile components (such as nose tips, re-entry vehicles, leading edges, jet vanes, control surfaces, or rocket motor throat inserts).

a.1. Spherical or spheroidal aluminum powder (C.A.S. 7429-90-5) in particle size of less than 200 x 10m (200 µm) and an aluminum content of 97% by weight or more, if at least 10% of the total weight is made up of particles of less than 63 µm, according to ISO 2591-1:1988 or national equivalents.

a.2. Metal powders and alloys where at least 90% of the total particles by particle volume or weight are made up of particles of less than 60 µ (determined by measurement techniques such as using a sieve, laser diffraction or optical scanning), whether spherical, atomized, spheroidal, flaked or ground, as follows:
