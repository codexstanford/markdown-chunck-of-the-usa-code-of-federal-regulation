###### Appendix A to Part 960 - Application Information Required
####### et seq.

To apply for a license to operate a remote sensing space system under 51 U.S.C. 60101,and this part, you must provide:

1. Material Facts: Fully accurate and responsive information to the following prompts under "Description of Applicant (Operator)" and "Description of System." If a question is not applicable, write "N/A" and explain, if necessary.

2. Affirmation: Confirm by indicating below that there will be, at all times, measures in place to ensure positive control of any spacecraft in the system that have propulsion, if applicable to your system. Such measures include encryption of telemetry, command, and control communications or alternative measures consistent with industry best practice.

3. Your response to each prompt below constitutes a material fact. If any information you submit becomes inaccurate or incomplete before a license grant or denial, you must promptly contact the Secretary and submit correct and updated information as instructed by the Secretary.

1. General Applicant Information

a. Name of Applicant (entity or individual):

b. Location and address of Applicant:

c. Applicant contact information (for example, general corporate or university contact information):

d. Contact information for a specific individual to serve as the point of contact with Commerce:

e. Contact information for a specific individual to serve as the point of contact with Commerce for limited-operations directives, if different than main point of contact, in the event that the applicant will receive a license in Tier 2 or Tier 3:

f. Place of incorporation and, if incorporated outside the United States, an acknowledgement that you will operate your system within the United States and are therefore subject to the Secretary's jurisdiction under this part:

2. Ownership interests in the Applicant:

a. If there is majority U.S. ownership: Report any domestic entity or individual with an ownership interest in the Applicant totaling at least 50 percent:

b. If there is not majority U.S. ownership: Report all foreign entities or individuals whose ownership interest in the Applicant is at least 10 percent:

3. Identity of any subsidiaries and affiliates playing a role in the operation of the System, including a brief description of that role:

1. General System Information

a. Name of system:

b. Brief mission description:

2. Remote Sensing Instrument(s) parameters

a. Sensor type (Electro Optical, Multi-Spectral (MSI), Hyperspectral (HSI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Thermal Infrared (TIR), etc.):

b. Imaging/frame rate in Hertz; pulse repetition frequency for SAR or LIDAR:

c. Spatial resolution in meters (show calculation for the anticipated finest ground spatial distance (GSD), impulse response (IPR), or other relevant appropriate unit of resolution):

d. Spectral range in nanometers:

e. Collection volume in area per unit time per spacecraft: Provide an estimate of the maximum number of square kilometers of which the system can provide data/imagery per hour or per minute. If this is a fast-framing system, consider each recorded frame as a separate image collected:

f. Ability of the remote sensing instrument to slew, point, or digitally look off-axis from the x, y, and z axes of travel:
