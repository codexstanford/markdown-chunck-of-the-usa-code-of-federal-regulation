####### Reexports to an alternate launch country.

(6)If a mechanical or weather related issue causes a change from the scheduled launch country to another foreign country after a commodity was exported or reexported, then that commodity may be subsequently reexported to the new scheduled launch country, provided all of the terms and conditions of paragraph (e) of this section are met, along with any other applicable EAR provisions. In such instances, the 6-month time limitation described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section would start over again at the time of the subsequent reexport transaction. Note that if the subsequent reexport may be made under the designation No License Required (NLR) or pursuant to an authorization under the EAR, a reexporter does not need to rely on the provisions contained in this paragraph (e).
