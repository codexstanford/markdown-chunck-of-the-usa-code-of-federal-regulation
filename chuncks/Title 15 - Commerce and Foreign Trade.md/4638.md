####### Power of attorney or other written authorization.

(h)In a "power of attorney" or other written authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal.

(1) An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization in the following circumstances:

(i) An agent that represents a foreign principal party in interest in a routed transaction must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth his authority; and

(ii) An agent that applies for a license on behalf of a principal party in interest must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth the agent's authority to apply for the license on behalf of the principal.

(2) This requirement for a power of attorney or other written authorization is a legal requirement aimed at ensuring that the parties to a transaction negotiate and understand their responsibilities. The absence of a power of attorney or other written authorization does not prevent BIS from using other evidence to establish the existence of an agency relationship for purposes of imposing liability.
