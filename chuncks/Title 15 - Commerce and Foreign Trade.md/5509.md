####### or

d.1. Soft body armor and protective garments manufactured to military standards or specifications, or to their equivalents, that provide ballistic protection equal to or less than NIJ level III (NIJ 0101.06, July 2008) or "equivalent standards";

d.2. Hard body armor plates that provide ballistic protection equal to NIJ level III (NIJ 0101.06, July 2008) or "equivalent standards".

e. Atmospheric diving suits "specially designed" for rescue operations for submarines controlled by the USML or the CCL.

f. Other personal protective "equipment" "specially designed" for military applications not controlled by the USML, not elsewhere controlled on the CCL.

g. to w. [Reserved]

x. "Parts," "components," "accessories," and "attachments" that are "specially designed" for a commodity controlled by ECCN 1A613 (except for 1A613.y) or an article enumerated in USML Category X, and not controlled elsewhere in the USML.

y. Other commodities as follows:

y.1 Conventional military steel helmets.

y.2 [Reserved]

The list of items controlled is contained in the ECCN heading.

b. Equipment limited by design or function to protect against hazards specific to civil industries, such as mining, quarrying, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, medical, veterinary, environmental, waste management, or to the food industry.

b. Radiographic detection equipment such as x-ray converters, and storage phosphor image plates.

a. Filament winding machines, of which the motions for positioning, wrapping and winding fibers are coordinated and programmed in three or more 'primary servo positioning' axes, "specially designed" for the manufacture of "composite" structures or laminates, from "fibrous or filamentary materials";

b. 'Tape laying machines', of which the motions for positioning and laying tape are coordinated and programmed in five or more 'primary servo positioning' axes, "specially designed" for the manufacture of "composite" airframe or missile structures;

c. Multidirectional, multidimensional weaving machines or interlacing machines, including adapters and modification kits, "specially designed" or modified for weaving, interlacing or braiding fibers for "composite" structures;

d. Equipment "specially designed" or adapted for the production of reinforcement fibers, as follows:

d.1. Equipment for converting polymeric fibers (such as polyacrylonitrile, rayon, pitch or polycarbosilane) into carbon fibers or silicon carbide fibers, including special equipment to strain the fiber during heating;

d.2. Equipment for the chemical vapor deposition of elements or compounds, on heated filamentary substrates, to manufacture silicon carbide fibers;

d.3. Equipment for the wet-spinning of refractory ceramics (such as aluminum oxide);

d.4. Equipment for converting aluminum containing precursor fibers into alumina fibers by heat treatment;

e. Equipment for producing prepregs controlled by 1C010.e by the hot melt method;

f. Non-destructive inspection equipment "specially designed" for "composite" materials, as follows:

f.1. X-ray tomography systems for three dimensional defect inspection;

f.2. Numerically controlled ultrasonic testing machines of which the motions for positioning transmitters or receivers are simultaneously coordinated and programmed in four or more axes to follow the three dimensional contours of the "part" or "component" under inspection;

g. Tow-placement machines, of which the motions for positioning and laying tows are coordinated and programmed in two or more 'primary servo positioning' axes, "specially designed" for the manufacture of "composite" airframe or missile structures.
