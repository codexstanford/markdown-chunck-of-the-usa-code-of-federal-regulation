(2) Vacuum pumps with a manufacturer's specified maximum flow-rate greater than 1 m/h (under standard temperature and pressure conditions), casings (pump bodies), preformed casing-liners, impellers, rotors, and jet pump nozzles designed for such pumps; n.e.s.;

(3) Laboratory equipment, including "components," "parts," and "accessories" for such equipment, for the analysis or detection, destructive or non-destructive, of chemical substances, n.e.s.;

(4) Whole chlor-alkali electrolysis cells (mercury, diaphragm, and membrane) and "components" "specially designed" therefor as follows:

(i) Electrodes;

(ii) Diaphragms; and

(iii) Ion exchange membranes;

(5) Compressors "specially designed" to compress wet or dry chlorine, regardless of material of construction;
