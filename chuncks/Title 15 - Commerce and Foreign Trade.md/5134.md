####### Interpretation 13: Encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons.

(m)Encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5A004 and 5D002 may be pre-loaded on a laptop, handheld device or other computer or equipment and exported under the tools of trade provision of License Exception TMP or the personal use exemption under License Exception BAG, subject to the terms and conditions of such License Exceptions. Neither License Exception TMP nor License Exception BAG contains a reporting requirement. Like other "information security" "software," components, "electronic assemblies" or modules, the control status of encryption commodities and software is determined in Category 5-Part 2 even if they are bundled, commingled or incorporated in a computer or other equipment. However, commodities and software specially designed for medical end use that incorporate an item in Category 5-Part 2 are not controlled in Category 5-Part 2. See paragraph (a) of supplement no. 3 to part 774 (Statements of Understanding) of the EAR.
