###### Procedure and evidence.

(d)In a hearing under this subpart, the Federal Rules of Evidence and Civil Procedure do not apply but the examiner shall exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence and all testimony shall be taken under oath or affirmation. The examiner may make such orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters which the examiner deems necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings and fundamental fairness to the parties. There shall be no discovery unless agreed to by the parties and ordered by the examiner. The hearing shall not be open to the public unless the former employee or the former employee's representative waives the right to a closed hearing, in which case the examiner shall determine whether the hearing will be open to the public.
