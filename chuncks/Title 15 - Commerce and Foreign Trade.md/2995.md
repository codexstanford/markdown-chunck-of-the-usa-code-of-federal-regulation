###### 718.2 Identification of confidential business information.
####### Confidential business information related to inspections disclosed to, reported to, or otherwise acquired by, the U.S. Government.

(d)(1) During inspections, certain confidential business information, as defined by the Act, may be disclosed to the Host Team. Facilities being inspected are responsible for identifying confidential business information to the Host Team, so that if it is disclosed to the Inspection Team, appropriate marking and handling can be arranged, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention (see ยง 718.3(c)(1)(ii) of the CWCR). Confidential business information not related to the purpose of an inspection or not necessary for the accomplishment of an inspection, as determined by the Host Team, may be removed from sight, shrouded, or otherwise not disclosed.

(2) Before or after inspections, confidential business information related to an inspection that is contained in any documents or that is reported to, or otherwise acquired by, the U.S. Government, such as facility information for pre-inspection briefings, facility agreements, and inspection reports, must be identified by the facility so that it may be appropriately marked and handled. If the U.S. Government creates derivative documents from such documents or reported information, they will also be marked and handled as confidential business information.
