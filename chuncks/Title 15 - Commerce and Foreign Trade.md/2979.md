####### Notice of challenge inspection.

(b)Challenge inspections may be made only upon issuance of written notice by the United States National Authority (USNA) to the owner and to the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises. BIS will provide notice of inspection to the inspection point of contact at such time that a person or facility has been clearly established, if possible, and when notification is deemed appropriate. If the United States is unable to provide actual written notice to the owner and to the operator, occupant or agent in charge, BIS (or another appropriate agency, if BIS is unable) may post notice prominently at the plant, plant site or other facility or location to be inspected.
