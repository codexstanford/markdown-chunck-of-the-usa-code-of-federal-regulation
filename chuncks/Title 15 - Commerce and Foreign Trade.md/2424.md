(b)A grantee's failure to submit a complete and accurate annual report pursuant to section 16 of the FTZ Act (19 U.S.C. 81p(b)) and § 400.51(c)(1) of these regulations constitutes a violation subject to a fine, with each day of continued failure to submit the report constituting a separate offense subject to a fine of not more than 1,000 dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 400.62(j)). Further, each day during which a zone operator fails to submit to the zone's grantee the information required for the grantee's timely submission of a complete and accurate annual report to the Board shall constitute a separate offense subject to a fine of not more than 1,000 dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to § 400.62(j)). Consistent with § 400.46, if the grantee submits a timely report to the Board identifying any operator that has not provided complete and timely information in response to a timely request(s) by the grantee, the grantee shall not be subject to a fine-assessment action stemming from the operator's failure to timely provide its report.
