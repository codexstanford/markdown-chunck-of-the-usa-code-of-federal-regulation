####### Time corrections.

(c)The UTC time scale operates on atomic frequency, but by means of step adjustments is made to approximate the astronomical UTI scale. It may disagree from UTI by as much as 0.9 second before step adjustments of exactly 1 second are made. These adjustments, or leap seconds are required about once per year and will usually be made on December 31 or June 30. For those who need astronomical time more accurately than 0.9 second, a correction to UTC is encoded by the use of double ticks after the start of each minute. The first through the eighth seconds ticks will indicate a "plus" correction, and from the ninth through the 16th a "minus" correction. The correction is determined by counting the number of double ticks. For example, if the first, second, and third ticks are doubled, the correction is "plus" 0.3 second. If the ninth, 10th, 11th, and 12th ticks are doubled, the correction is "minus" 0.4 second.
