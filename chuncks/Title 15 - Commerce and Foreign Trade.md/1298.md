####### Primary quantity.

(15)The quantity is the total number of units that correspond to the first unit of measure specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. Where the unit of measure is in terms of weight (grams, kilograms, metric tons, etc.), the quantity reflects the net weight, not including the weight of barrels, boxes, or other bulky coverings, and not including salt or pickle in the case of salted or pickled fish or meats. For a few commodities where "content grams" or "content kilograms" or some similar weight unit is specified in Schedule B or HTSUSA, the quantity may be less than the net weight. The quantity is reported as a whole unit only, without commas or decimals. If the quantity contains a fraction of a whole unit, round fractions of one-half unit or more up and fractions of less than one-half unit down to the nearest whole unit. (For example, where the unit for a given commodity is in terms of "tons," a net quantity of 8.4 tons would be reported as 8 for the quantity. If the quantity is less than one unit, the quantity is 1.)
