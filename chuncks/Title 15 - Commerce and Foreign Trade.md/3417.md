() ECCNs that do not use the phrase "(see List of Items controlled)." When all items classified in the ECCN are listed in the heading, a sentence is generally included in the "items" paragraph to direct you to the heading. An example of such a heading is ECCN 4E980 "Technology" for the "development," "production" or "use" of commodities controlled by 4A980. ECCNs 0A982, 5D101, 8D001 and 9A002 are other examples where the heading is the exclusive description of the items classified under those respective ECCNs.
