####### Exemption from liability.,per se,

(a)A grant of authority,shall not be construed to make the zone grantee liable for violations by zone participants. The role of the zone grantee under the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations is to provide general management of the zone to ensure that the reasonable needs of the business community are served. It would not be in the public interest to discourage public entities from zone sponsorship because of concern about liability without fault.
