###### Methods.

(b)A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirement of ยง 8b.19, or any other method that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped individuals. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate.

(c) If a small recipient finds, after consultation with a qualified handicapped individual seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities or facility, the small recipient may, as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped individual to other providers of those services that are accessible at no additional cost to the handicapped.
