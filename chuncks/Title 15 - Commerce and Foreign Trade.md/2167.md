(2) A producer fails to satisfy or fulfill any term, condition or representation, whether undertaken by itself or prescribed by the Departments, upon which receipt of allocation has been predicated or upon which the Departments have relied in connection with the sale or transfer of a business together with its allocation;

(3) A producer, in the judgment of the Secretaries, has failed to make a meaningful contribution to the territory for a period of two or more consecutive calendar years, when compared with the performance of the duty-free watch assembly industry in the territory as a whole. This comparison shall include the producer's quantitative use of its allocations, amount of direct labor employed in the assembly of watches and watch movements, and the net amount of corporate income taxes paid to the government of the territory. If the producer fails to satisfy the Secretaries as to why such action should not be taken, the firm's allocation shall be reduced or cancelled, whichever is appropriate under the show-cause order. The eligibility of a firm whose allocation has been cancelled to receive further allocations may also be terminated.

(b) The Secretaries may also issue a show-cause order to reduce or cancel a producer's allocation or production incentive certificate (see ยง 303.12, below), as appropriate, or to declare the producer ineligible to receive an allocation or certificate if it violates any regulation in this part, uses a form, license, permit, or certificate in an unauthorized manner, or fails to provide information or data required by these regulations or requested by the Secretaries or their delegates in the performance of their responsibilities.

(c) If a firm's allocation is reduced or cancelled, or if a firm voluntarily relinquishes a part of its allocation, the Secretaries may:

(1) Reallocate the allocation involved among the remaining producers in a manner best suited to contribute to the economy of the territory;

(2) Reallocate the allocation or part thereof to a new entrant applicant; or

(3) Do neither of the above if deemed in the best interest of the territories and the established industry.
