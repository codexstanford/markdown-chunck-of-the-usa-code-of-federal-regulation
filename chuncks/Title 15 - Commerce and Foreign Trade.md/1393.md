###### ยง 30.60 Confidentiality of Electronic Export Information.

(a) The Electronic Export Information (EEI) collected and accessed by the Census Bureau under 15 CFR Part 30 is confidential, to be used solely for official purposes as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce. The collection of EEI by the Department of Commerce has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collected is used by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes. In addition, EEI is used by federal government agencies, such as the Department of State, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for export control; by other federal government agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bureau of Transportation Statistics for statistical purposes; and by other federal agencies as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce or the Census Bureau Director consistent with the agencies' statutory or legal authorities as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section. Absent such authorization, information collected pursuant to this Part shall not be disclosed to anyone by any officer, employee, contractor, agent of the federal government or other parties with access to the EEI other than to the USPPI or the authorized agent of the USPPI. Such disclosure shall be limited to that information provided by each party pursuant to this Part.
