####### C. Coastal grasslands.

This area, which possesses sand dunes and coastal flats, has low rainfall (10 to 30 inches per year) and large amounts of humus in the soil. Ecological succession is slow, resulting in the presence of a number of seral stages of community development. Dominant vegetation includes mid-grasses (5 to 8 feet tall), such as Spartina, and trees such as willow (Salix sp.), cherry (Prunus sp.), and cottonwood (Pupulus deltoides.) This area is divided into four regions with the following typical strand vegetation:

1. Arctic/Boreal: Elymus;

2. Northeast/West: Ammophla;

3. Southeast Gulf: Uniola; and

4. Mid-Atlantic/Gulf: Spartina patens.
