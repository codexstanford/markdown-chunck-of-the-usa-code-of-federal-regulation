####### e.g.,

(2) For families of products where all the information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement is identical except for the model/series/part number (entry (a)(2)), you may list and describe these products with a single line in your .csv file using an appropriate model/series/part number identifier ('300' or '3xx') for entry (a)(2), provided each line in your .csv file corresponds to a single product series (or product type) within an overall product family.

(3) For example, if Company A produces, markets and sells both a '100' ('1xx') and a '300' ('3xx') series of product, in its encryption self-classification report (.csv file) Company A must list the '100' product series in one line (with entry (a)(2) completed as '100' or '1xx') and the '300' product series in another line (with entry (a)(2) completed as '300' or '3xx'), even if the other required information is common to all products in the '100' and '300' series.

(4) Only products self-classified by the exporter or reexporter must be reported. Products submitted for classification by the Bureau of Industry and Security for which a CCATS is issued do not need to be reported.
