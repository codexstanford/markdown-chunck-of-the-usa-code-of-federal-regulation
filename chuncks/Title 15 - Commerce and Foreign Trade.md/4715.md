####### Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting country's requirements.

(e)

(1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or transshipments of exports to:

(i) A boycotted country;

(ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;

(iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country; or

(iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.

(2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country; on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, including those located in third countries.

(3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the vendor of the shipment:

(i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or

(ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include the boycotted country.

(4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country.
