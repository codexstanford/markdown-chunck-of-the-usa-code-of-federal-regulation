####### USPPI identification number.

(iii)Report the EIN or DUNS number of the USPPI. If the USPPI has only one EIN, report that EIN. If the USPPI has more than one EIN, report the EIN that the USPPI uses to report employee wages and withholdings, not an EIN used to report only company earnings or receipts. Use of another company's EIN is prohibited. The appropriate Party ID Type code shall be reported to the AES. If a foreign entity is in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for export, the foreign entity is the USPPI. In such situations, when the foreign entity does not have an EIN, the authorized agent shall report a border crossing number, passport number, or any number assigned by CBP on behalf of the foreign entity.
