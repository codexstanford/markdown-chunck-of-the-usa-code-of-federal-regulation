(a)As soon as practicable after January 1 of each year the Secretaries shall make an interim allocation to each producer equaling 70% of the number of watch units it has entered duty-free into the customs territory of the United States during the first eight months of the preceding calendar year, or any lesser amount requested in writing by the producer. The Secretaries may also issue a lesser amount if, in their judgment, the producer might otherwise receive an interim allocation in an amount greater than the producer's probable annual allocation. In calculating the interim allocations, the Director shall count only duty-free watches and watch movements verified by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, or verified by other means satisfctory to the Secretaries, as having been entered on or before August 31 of the preceding year. Interim allocations shall not be published.
