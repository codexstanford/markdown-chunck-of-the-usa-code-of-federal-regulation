(b)Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item that requires a license for pursuant to the requirements of this section will be reviewed with a policy of denial. The following types of license applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the transaction in question would benefit the Russian or Belarusian government or defense sector: applications involving items to meet humanitarian needs and applications for the disposition of items by companies not headquartered in Country Group D:1, D:5, E:1 or E:2 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 that are curtailing or closing all operations in Russia or Belarus. The case-by-case license application review policy for items to meet humanitarian needs is included to address certain 'luxury goods' items that may be used in medical devices or situations in which a case-by-case analysis is needed to determine whether a license application should be approved to meet humanitarian needs while also taking into account the applicable broader U.S. national security and foreign policy concerns.
