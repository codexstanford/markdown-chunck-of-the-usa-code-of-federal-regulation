h.2. "Development" or "production" "technology" for control and diagnostic "parts" or "components" unique to the "FADEC system" and used to regulate engine thrust or shaft power;

h.3. "Development" "technology" for the control law algorithms, including "source code", unique to the "FADEC system" and used to regulate engine thrust or shaft power;

i. "Technology" for adjustable flow path systems designed to maintain engine stability for gas generator turbines, fan or power turbines, or propelling nozzles, as follows:

i.1. "Development" "technology" for deriving the functional requirements for the "parts" or "components" that maintain engine stability;

i.2. "Development" or "production" "technology" for "parts" or "components" unique to the adjustable flow path system and that maintain engine stability;

i.3. "Development" "technology" for the control law algorithms, including "source code", unique to the adjustable flow path system and that maintain engine stability;
