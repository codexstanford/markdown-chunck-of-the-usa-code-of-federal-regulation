CW applies to 1C350.b and .c. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for CW reasons. A license is required, for CW reasons, to export or reexport Schedule 2 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.b to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR). A license is required, for CW reasons, to export Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c to States not Party to the CWC, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country has been obtained by the exporter prior to export. A license is required, for CW reasons, to reexport Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c from a State not Party to the CWC to any other State not Party to the CWC. (See ยง 742.18 of the EAR for license requirements and policies for toxic and precursor chemicals controlled for CW reasons. See ยง 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements that apply to exports of Schedule 3 chemicals to countries not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR.)

AT applies to entire entry. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for AT reasons in 1C350. A license is required, for AT reasons, to export or reexport items controlled by 1C350 to a country in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. (See part 742 of the EAR for additional information on the AT controls that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)
