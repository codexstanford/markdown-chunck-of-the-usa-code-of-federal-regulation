####### Computation of time.

(e)In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period is to be included in the computation unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). In such instance, the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less-there is no cap on the period of time to which this exclusion applies, whenever the period of time prescribed or allowed by this part is computed in business days, rather than calendar days.
