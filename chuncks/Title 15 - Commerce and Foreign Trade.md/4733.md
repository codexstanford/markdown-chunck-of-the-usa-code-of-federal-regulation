####### Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycotting country.

A."In connection with the performance of this contract the Contractor/Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country shall apply to the furnishing and shipment of any products or components thereof to the boycotting country. The Contractor/Supplier specifically acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country prohibit, among other things, the importation into the boycotting country of products or components thereof: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country."

It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customs requirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performance of a contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under this part 760. See § 760.2(a)(5) and example (iii) under "Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business." It is also the Department's position that an agreement to comply generally with the import and customs requirements of a boycotting country does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under this part 760. See § 760.2(a)(5) and examples (iv) and (v) under "Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business." In addition, it is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out in the second sentence above, to comply with the boycotting country's import and customs requirements prohibiting the importation of products or components: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (3) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country falls within the exception contained in § 760.3(a) for compliance with the import requirements of a boycotting country. See § 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.

The Department notes that a United States person may not furnish a negative certification regarding the origin of goods or their components even though the certification is furnished in response to the import and shipping document requirements of the boycotting country. See § 760.3(c) and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder, and § 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.
