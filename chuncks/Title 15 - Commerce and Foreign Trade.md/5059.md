####### How BIS Makes Suspension and Deferral Decisions,Civil Penalties.

(f)-(1)In appropriate cases, payment of a civil monetary penalty may be deferred or suspended. See ยง 764.3(a)(1)(iii) of the EAR. In determining whether suspension or deferral is appropriate, BIS may consider, for example, whether the party has demonstrated a limited ability to pay a penalty that would be appropriate for such violations, so that suspended or deferred payment can be expected to have sufficient deterrent value, and whether, in light of all the circumstances, such suspension or deferral is necessary to make the impact of the penalty consistent with the impact of BIS penalties on other parties who committed similar violations.
