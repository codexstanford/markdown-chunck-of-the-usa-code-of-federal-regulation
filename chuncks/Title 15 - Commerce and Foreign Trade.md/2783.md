###### ยง 712.6 Advance notification and annual report of all exports and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals to, or from, other States Parties.

Pursuant to the Convention, the United States is required to notify the OPCW not less than 30 days in advance of every export or import of a Schedule 1 chemical, in any quantity, to or from another State Party. In addition, the United States is required to provide a report of all exports and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals to or from other States Parties during each calendar year. If you plan to export or import any quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical from or to your declared facility, undeclared facility or trading company, you must notify BIS in advance of the export or import and complete an annual report of exports and imports that actually occurred during the previous calendar year. The United States will transmit to the OPCW the advance notifications and a detailed annual declaration of each actual export or import of a Schedule 1 chemical from/to the United States. Note that the advance notification and annual report requirements of this section do not relieve you of any requirement to obtain a license for export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the EAR or ITAR or a license for import of Schedule 1 chemicals from the Department of Justice under the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Regulations in 27 CFR part 447. Only "declared" facilities, as defined in ยง 712.5(e) of the CWCR, are subject to initial and routine inspections pursuant to part 716 of the CWCR.
