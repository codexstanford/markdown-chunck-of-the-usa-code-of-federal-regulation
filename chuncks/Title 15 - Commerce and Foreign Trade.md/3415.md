() "(See List of Items Controlled)" is at the end of the ECCN heading. An example of an ECCN where all of the heading text precedes the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)" is ECCN 8A002 Marine systems, equipment, "parts" and "components," as follows (see List of Items Controlled). ECCNs 1A001, 3A001, 6A001, 7A004 and 9A012 are other examples where all of the heading text precedes the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)." In these types of headings, the items paragraphs must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the heading and classified under that ECCN.
