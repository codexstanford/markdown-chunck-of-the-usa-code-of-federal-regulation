###### ยง 30.60 Confidentiality of Electronic Export Information.
####### Determination by the Secretary of Commerce.

(e)Under 13 U.S.C. 301(g), the EEI collected and accessed by the Census Bureau is exempt from public disclosure unless the Secretary or delegate determines that such exemption would be contrary to the national interest. The Secretary or delegate may make such information available, if he or she determines it is in the national interest, taking such safeguards and precautions to limit dissemination as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. In determining whether it is contrary to the national interest to apply the exemption, the maintenance of confidentiality and national security shall be considered as important elements of national interest. The unauthorized disclosure of confidential EEI granted under a National Interest Determination renders such persons subject to the civil penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.
