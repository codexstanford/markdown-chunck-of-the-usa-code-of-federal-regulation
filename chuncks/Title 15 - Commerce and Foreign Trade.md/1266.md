####### Notice of revocation.

(4)Approved postdeparture filing USPPIs whose postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by other agencies shall contact those agencies for their specific revocation and appeal procedures. When the Census Bureau makes a determination to revoke an approved USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges, the USPPI will be notified electronically of the reason(s) for the decision. In most cases, the revocation shall become effective when the USPPI has either exhausted all appeal procedures, or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation, if no appeal is filed. However, in cases judged to affect national security, revocations shall become effective immediately upon notification.
