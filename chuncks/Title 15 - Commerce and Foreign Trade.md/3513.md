###### ยง 740.10 License Exception Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).

License Exception RPL authorizes exports and reexports associated with one-for-one replacement of parts, components, accessories, and attachments. License Exception RPL also authorizes exports and reexports of certain items currently "subject to the EAR" to or for, or to replace, a defense article described in an export or reexport authorization issued under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. It does not, however, authorize the export or reexport of defense articles subject to the ITAR, i.e., described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR 121.1).
