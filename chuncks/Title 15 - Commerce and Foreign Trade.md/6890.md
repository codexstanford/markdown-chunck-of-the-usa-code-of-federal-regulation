####### B. Coast shrublands.

This is a transitional area between the coastal grasslands and woodlands and is characterized by woody species with multiple stems and a few centimeters to several meters above the ground developing under the influence of salt spray and occasional sand burial. This includes thickets, scrub, scrub savanna, heathlands, and coastal chaparral. There is a great variety of shrubland vegetation exhibiting regional specificity:

1. Northern areas: Characterized by Hudsonia, various erinaceous species, and thickets of Myricu, prunus, and Rosa.

2. Southeast areas: Floral dominants include Myrica, Baccharis, and Iles.

3. Western areas: Adenostoma, arcotyphylos, and eucalyptus are the dominant floral species.
