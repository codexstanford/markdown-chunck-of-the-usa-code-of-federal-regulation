###### ยง 740.13 Technology and software - unrestricted (TSU).
####### Exclusions.

(2)The provisions of this paragraph (d) are not available for encryption software controlled for "EI" reasons under ECCN 5D002 or for encryption software with symmetric key length exceeding 64-bits that qualifies as mass market encryption software under the criteria in the Cryptography Note (Note 3) of Category 5, Part 2, of the CCL (supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). (Once such mass market encryption software has been released from "EI" and "NS" controls pursuant to ยง 740.17(b) of the EAR, it is controlled under ECCN 5D992.c and is thus outside the scope of License Exception TSU.) See ยง 740.17(b) of the EAR for exports and reexports of mass market encryption products controlled under ECCN 5D992.c.
