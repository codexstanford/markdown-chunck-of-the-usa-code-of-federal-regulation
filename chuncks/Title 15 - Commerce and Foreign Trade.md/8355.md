Every 180 days thereafter until the transmission of the investigation report, the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce shall notify the Secretary and NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer making the allegation of the current progress of the investigation and estimated time remaining until completion and transmittal of the investigation report.

(6) At the request of the Records Examination Board, shall submit a copy of the investigation report to the Records Examination Board.

(1) Shall consider an application for the correction of records made by a NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer who has filed a complaint investigated by the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce alleging that a personnel action was taken, withheld, or threatened in reprisal for making or preparing or being perceived as making or preparing a protected communication.

(5) Shall issue an appropriate recommendation to the Director concerning corrections, deletions, or additions to the NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer's records not later than 90 days after the NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer made a request to the Director to convene such a Records Examination Board. If the Records Examination Board requests a further report as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and determines that it cannot issue recommendations within 90 days, the Records Examination Board shall notify the officer or former officer and the Director and provide an estimate of time remaining until completion.

(1) Shall issue a decision concerning the correction of the NOAA Corps officer's or former NOAA Corps officer's records within 60 days of receiving the Records Examination Board's decision, but no sooner than 20 days after receiving the Records Examination Board decision to allow sufficient time for the NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer to submit any written disagreement with the Records Examination Board's recommendations under paragraph (c) of this section, and ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken;

(2) Shall notify the Inspector General of his or her decision concerning an application for the correction of personnel records of a NOAA Corps officer or former NOAA Corps officer who alleged reprisal for making or preparing or being perceived as making or preparing a protected communication at the time the Director issues a decision under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and

(3) Shall take appropriate administrative disciplinary action against the individual or individuals found to have taken, withheld, or threatened a personnel action as reprisal if those individuals are under the Director's chain of command.
