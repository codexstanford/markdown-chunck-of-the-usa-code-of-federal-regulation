###### ยง 758.1 The Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES).
####### Export control information on the EEI filing in AES.

(g)For each item on the EEI filing, you must report the license authority (license number, License Exception symbol, or No License Required (NLR) designator), the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), and the item description in the designated blocks. The item description must be stated in Commerce Control List (CCL) terms. If those terms are inadequate to meet the Bureau of Census requirements, the FTR requires that you give enough additional detail to permit verification of the Schedule B Number (or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) number). See 15 CFR part 30, appendix B, part III of the FTR for license codes.
