####### ยง 303.6 Allocation and reallocation of exemptions among producers.
######## Special allocations.

(e)A producer may request a special allocation if unusual circumstances kept it from making duty-free shipments at a level comparable with its past record. In considering such requests, the Secretaries shall take into account the firm's proposed assembly operations; its record in contributing to the territorial economy; and its intentions and capacity to make meaningful contributions to the territory. They shall also first determine that the amount of the special allocation requested will not significantly affect the amounts allocated to other producers pursuant to ยง 303.6(b)(1).
