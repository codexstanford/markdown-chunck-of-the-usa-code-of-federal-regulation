(b) The State agency is responsible for commenting on and concurring with or objecting to Federal agency consistency determinations and negative determinations (subpart C of this part), consistency certifications for federal licenses, permits, and Outer Continental Shelf plans (subparts D, E and I of this part), and reviewing the consistency of federal assistance activities proposed by applicant agencies (subpart F of this part). The State agency shall be responsible for securing necessary review and comment from other State, regional, or local government agencies, and, where applicable, the public. Thereafter, only the State agency is authorized to comment officially on or concur with or object to a federal consistency determination or negative determination, a consistency certification, or determine the consistency of a proposed federal assistance activity.

(c) If described in a State's management program, the issuance or denial of relevant State permits can constitute the State agency's consistency concurrence or objection if the State agency ensures that the State permitting agencies or the State agency review individual projects to ensure consistency with all applicable State management program policies and that applicable public participation requirements are met. The State agency shall monitor such permits issued by another State agency.
