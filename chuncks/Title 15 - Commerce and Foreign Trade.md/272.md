##### ยง 7.107 Procedures governing response and mitigation.

Within 30 days of service of the Secretary's notification pursuant to ยง 7.105, a party to an ICTS Transaction may respond to the Secretary's initial determination or assert that the circumstances resulting in the initial determination no longer apply, and thus seek to have the initial determination rescinded or mitigated pursuant to the following administrative procedures:

(a) A party may submit arguments or evidence that the party believes establishes that insufficient basis exists for the initial determination, including any prohibition of the ICTS Transaction;

(b) A party may propose remedial steps on the party's part, such as corporate reorganization, disgorgement of control of the foreign adversary, engagement of a compliance monitor, or similar steps, which the party believes would negate the basis for the initial determination;

(c) Any submission must be made in writing;

(d) A party responding to the Secretary's initial determination may request a meeting with the Department, and the Department may, at its discretion, agree or decline to conduct such meetings prior to making a final determination pursuant to ยง 7.109;

(e) This rule creates no right in any person to obtain access to information in the possession of the U.S. Government that was considered in making the initial determination to prohibit the ICTS Transaction, to include classified national security information or sensitive but unclassified information; and

(f) (f) If the Department receives no response from the parties within 30 days after service of the initial determination to the parties, the Secretary may determine to issue a final determination without the need to engage in the consultation process provided in section 7.108 of this rule.
