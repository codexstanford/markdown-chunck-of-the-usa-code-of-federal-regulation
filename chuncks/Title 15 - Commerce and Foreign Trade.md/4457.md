###### ยง 748.15 Authorization Validated End-User (VEU).

Authorization Validated End-User (VEU) permits the export, reexport, and transfer to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be used in a specific eligible destination. Validated end-users are those who have been approved in advance pursuant to the requirements of this section. To be eligible for authorization VEU, exporters, reexporters, and potential validated end-users must adhere to the conditions and restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. If a request for VEU authorization for a particular end-user is not granted, no new license requirement is triggered. In addition, such a result does not render the end-user ineligible for license approvals from BIS.
