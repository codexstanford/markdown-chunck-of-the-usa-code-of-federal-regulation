### PART 10 - PROCEDURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOLUNTARY PRODUCT STANDARDS
#### ยง 10.0 General.
##### Requirements for Department of Commerce sponsorship.

(b)The Department may sponsor the development of a voluntary Product Standard if, upon receipt of a request, the Department determines that:

(1) The proposed standard is likely to have substantial public impact;

(2) The proposed standard reflects the broad interest of an industry group or an organization concerned with the manufacture, production, packaging, distribution, testing, consumption, or use of the product, or the interest of a Federal or State agency;

(3) The proposed standard would not duplicate a standard published by, or actively being developed or revised by, a private standards-writing organization to such an extent that it would contain similar requirements and test methods for identical types of products, unless such duplication was deemed by the Department to be in the public interest;

(4) Lack of government sponsorship would result in significant public disadvantage for legal reasons or reasons of domestic and international trade;

(5) The proposed standard is not appropriate for development and maintenance by a private standards-writing organization; and

(6) The proposed standard will be funded by a proponent organization or government agency to cover costs for administrative and technical support services provided by the Department.
