### PART 15 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
#### Subpart B - Testimony by Employees and the Production of Documents in Legal Proceedings
##### ยง 15.14 Demand for testimony or production of documents in matters in which the United States is not a party.
###### Consultation.

(e)The General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a party, or with the party if not represented by an attorney, to refine or limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or seek additional information about the demand necessary to make the determination required by paragraph (b) of this section. Failure of the attorney or party to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel or the appropriate agency counsel to make an informed decision under this subpart may serve, where appropriate, as a basis for a determination not to comply with the demand. In addition, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may impose further conditions or restrictions on the production of any document or testimony when that is in the best interests of the United States.
