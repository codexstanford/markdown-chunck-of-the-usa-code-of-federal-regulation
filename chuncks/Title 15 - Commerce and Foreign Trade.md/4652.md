###### ยง 758.4 Use of export license.
####### Exports against license with approved name changes.

(d)If you are exporting against a license with approved name changes under ยง 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR, prior to using that export license you are required to include in the respective name field in AES (e.g., in the USPPI name field in AES), the new name followed by the original name in this format "[new name] f.k.a. [original name]." This reporting requirement would be completed by the authorized filer of the electronic export information (EEI) in AES. Although not required, the exporter may include a copy of the BIS written response approving the non-material name changes in accordance with ยง 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR. If the items have already been exported against the license by the time the name changes are approved, you are not required to report this additional information in AES, but you still must follow the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.
