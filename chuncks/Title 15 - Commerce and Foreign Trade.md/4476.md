(2)The United States requires security safeguards for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of High Performance Computers (HPCs) to ensure that they are used for peaceful purposes. If you are submitting a license application for an export, reexport, or in-country transfer of a high performance computer to or within a destination in Computer Tier 3 (see ยง 740.7(c)(1) of the EAR) or to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria you must include with your license application a security safeguard plan signed by the end-user, who may also be the ultimate consignee. This requirement also applies to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of components or electronic assemblies to upgrade existing "computer" installations in those countries.
