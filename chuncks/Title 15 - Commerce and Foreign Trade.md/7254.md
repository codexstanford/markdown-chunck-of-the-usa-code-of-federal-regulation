Pursuant to Michigan State Administrative Rule R 322.1013 of Part 325, Great Lakes Submerged Lands of Public Act 451 (Michigan State Statute), the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (Department) issues permits for projects that are of a minor nature which are not controversial, which have minimal adverse environmental impact, which will be constructed of clean, non-polluting materials, which do not impair the use of the adjacent bottomlands by the public, and which do not adversely affect riparian interests of adjacent owners. The following projects are minor projects:

(a) Noncommercial single piers, docks, and boat hoists which meet the following design criteria:

(i) are of a length or size not greater than the length or size of similar structures in the vicinity and on the watercourse involved; and

(ii) provide for the free littoral flow of water and drift material.

(b) Spring piles and pile clusters when their design and purpose is usual for such projects in the vicinity and on the watercourse involved.

(c) Seawalls, bulkheads, and other permanent revetment structures which meet all of the following purpose and design criteria:

(i) the proposed structure fulfills an identifiable need for erosion protection, bank stabilization, protection of uplands, or improvements on uplands;

(ii) the structure will be constructed of suitable materials free from pollutants, waste metal products, debris, or organic materials;

(iii) the structure is not more than 300 feet in length and is located in an area on the body of water where other similar structures already exist;

(iv) the placement of backfill or other fill associated with the construction does not exceed an average of 3 cubic yards per running foot along the shoreline and a maximum of 300 cubic yards; and

(v) the structure or any associated fill will not be placed in a wetland area or placed in any manner that impairs surface water flow into or out of any wetland area.

(d) Groins 50 feet or less in length, as measures from the toe to bluff, which meet all of the following criteria:

(i) the groin is low profile, with the lakeward end not more than 1 foot above the existing water level; and

(ii) the groin is placed at leastof the groin length from the adjacent property line or closer with written approval of the adjacent riparian.

(e) Filling for restoration of existing permitted fill, fills placed incidental to construction of other structures, and fills that do not exceed 300 cubic yards as a single and complete project, where the fill is of suitable material free from pollutants, waste metal products, debris, or organic materials.

(f) Dredging for the maintenance of previously dredged areas or dredging of not more than 300 cubic yards as a single and complete project when both of the following criteria are met:

(i) No reasonable expectation exists that the materials to be dredged are polluted; and

(ii) All dredging materials will be removed to an upland site exclusive of wetland areas.

(g) Structural repair of man-made structures, except as exempted by Michigan State Administrative Rule R 322.1008(3), when their design and purpose meet both of the following criteria:

(i) The repair does not alter the original use of a recently serviceable structure; and

(ii) The repair will not adversely affect public trust values or interests, including navigation and water quality.

(h) Fish or wildlife habitat structures which meet both of the following criteria:

(i) Are placed so the structures do not impede or create a navigational hazard; and

(ii) Are anchored to the bottomlands.

(i) Scientific structures such as staff gauges, water monitoring devices, water quality testing devices, survey devices, and core sampling devices, if the structures do not impede or create a navigational hazard.

(j) Navigational aids which meet both of the following criteria:

(i) Are approved by the United States Coast Guard; and
