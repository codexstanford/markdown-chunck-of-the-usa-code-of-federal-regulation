(2) In some circumstances, BIS may authorize changing the name of a person listed on a license (, name of exporter, reexporter, purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee or end user), provided the pertinent person has not undergone a change in ownership, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued. In order to rely on this paragraph (c)(2), BIS must have approved the name change in response to an advisory opinion request submitted by the licensee pursuant to ยง 748.3(c) of the EAR and the instructions below.

(i) The advisory opinion request must be submitted on the licensee's company letterhead and include the following information:

(A) The title of the advisory opinion, in this format: "License name change notification and review request;"

(B) All license numbers subject to the notification and review request (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);

(C) The name(s) changing on the license(s) (include the original and new names), and when the name(s) are changing (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);

(D) Any background information available on the reasons for the name change(s) (e.g., press releases from the person changing its name(s)); and

(E) A statement regarding whether there has been a change in ownership, including a merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status regarding the person(s) changing its name(s).

(F) Confirmation that, if the request is approved, the licensee will share the advisory opinion response from BIS with all other persons listed on the license, and inform those persons that the advisory opinion response must be retained pursuant to the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.

(ii) If BIS determines the name change is not a material change to the license and approves the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification. If BIS does not approve the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification.

(iii) For guidance on using an export license with approved name changes, see ยง 758.4(d) (Exports against license with approved name change).

(iv) If a license name change notification and review request is denied by BIS or the licensee determines that there has been a material change to the license, such as a change in ownership of a person on the license, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued, a new license application should be submitted.
