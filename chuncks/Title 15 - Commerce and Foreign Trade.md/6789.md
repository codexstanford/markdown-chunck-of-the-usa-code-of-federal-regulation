##### PART 911 - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CONCERNING USE OF THE NOAA SPACE-BASED DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS
###### ยง 911.7 Continuation of the NOAA Data Collection Systems.

(a) NOAA expects to continue to operate DCS on its geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, subject to the availability of future appropriations. However, viable commercial space-based alternatives may eventually obviate the need for NOAA to operate its own space-based DCS.

(b) If use of the system in support of NOAA programs increases, it eventually may be necessary to the further restrict system usage by other users. If such restrictions on use become necessary, or in the event that NOAA discontinues operation of GOES and/or POES, NOAA will provide, to the maximum extent practicable, advance notice and an orderly transition.

(c) NOAA will not be responsible for any losses resulting from the nonavailability of the NOAA DCS.
