####### Request for expedited action.

(a)(1) An applicant may be granted expedited action on its application in the discretion of the Secretary and the Attorney General.

A request for expedited action should include an explanation of why expedited action is needed, including a statement of all relevant facts and circumstances, such as bidding deadlines or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, that require the applicant to act in less than ninety days and that have a significant impact on the applicant's export trade.

(2) The Secretary shall advise the applicant within ten days after the application is deemed submitted whether it will receive expedited action. The Secretary may grant the request in whole or in part and process the remainder of the application through the normal procedures. Expedited action may be granted only if the Attorney General concurs.
