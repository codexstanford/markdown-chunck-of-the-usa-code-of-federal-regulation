####### Pre-docketing review.

(b)The grantee shall submit a single complete copy of an application for pre-docketing review. (For requests relating to production in already approved zone or subzone space, the request may be submitted by the operator, provided the operator at the same time furnishes a copy of the request to the grantee.) The Executive Secretary shall determine whether the application satisfies the requirements of §§ 400.12, 400.21, 400.23-400.25, and other applicable provisions of this part such that the application is sufficient for docketing. If the pre-docketing copy of the application is deficient, the Executive Secretary shall notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the pre-docketing copy, specifying the deficiencies. An affected zone participant may also be contacted regarding relevant application elements requiring additional information or clarification. If the applicant does not correct the deficiencies and submit a corrected pre-docketing application copy within 30 days of notification, the pre-docketing application (single copy) shall be discarded.
