###### See

(c) As part of its debt collection process, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Commerce debts by administrative and tax refund offset.31 CFR 285.12(g). The Treasury Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a Federal payment is disbursed, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the Federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, but are not limited to, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.
