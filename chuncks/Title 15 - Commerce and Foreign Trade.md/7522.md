####### ยง 930.121 Consistent with the objectives or purposes of the Act.

A federal license or permit activity, or a federal assistance activity, is "consistent with the objectives or purposes of the Act" if it satisfies each of the following three requirements:

(a) The activity furthers the national interest as articulated in ยง 302 or ยง 303 of the Act, in a significant or substantial manner,

(b) The national interest furthered by the activity outweighs the activity's adverse coastal effects, when those effects are considered separately or cumulatively.

(c) There is no reasonable alternative available which would permit the activity to be conducted in a manner consistent with the enforceable policies of the management program. The Secretary may consider but is not limited to considering previous appeal decisions, alternatives described in state objection letters and alternatives and other information submitted during the appeal. The Secretary shall not consider an alternative unless the State agency submits a statement, in a brief or other supporting material, to the Secretary that the alternative would permit the activity to be conducted in a manner consistent with the enforceable policies of the management program.
