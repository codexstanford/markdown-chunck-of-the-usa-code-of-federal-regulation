###### Admissions.

(b)In administering its admission policies, a recipient to which this subpart applies:

(1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of handicapped individuals who may be admitted; and

(2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped individuals or any class of handicapped individuals unless:

(i) The test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question; and

(ii) Alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Secretary to be available.

(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level of whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped individuals; and

(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make pre-admission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped individual but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
