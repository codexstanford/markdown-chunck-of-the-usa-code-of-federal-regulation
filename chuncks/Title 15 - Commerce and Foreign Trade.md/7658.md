####### i.e.,

ii. Relationship to Applicant (operating under Applicant's instructions under a contract):

7. Information Applicable to Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) and/or Hyper-Spectral Imaging (HSI). Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B section 2.a. is "MSI" and/or "HSI."

a. Number of spectral bands:

b. Individual spectral bandwidths (to include range of the upper and lower ends of each spectral band in nanometers):

8. Noise Equivalent Target (NET). Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B 2.c. is 5 meters or less, and the answer in Part B section 2.a. is neither "SAR" nor "LIDAR." NET is the primary parameter used by the U.S. Government to describe an Electro Optical sensor's light sensitivity performance for a target at the same distance from the sensor as is specified as the minimum operating altitude in Part B section 4.d.i. If NET cannot be calculated, simply report the expected minimum detectable ground target radiance in watts:

9. Information Applicable to Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) if used for remote sensing. Responses should include the calculations used to derive the reported parameters. Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B section 2.a. is "LIDAR."

a. Type (linear scanning or flash LIDAR (Geiger)):

b. Laser wavelength and pulse frequency:

c. Laser pulse width:

d. Spectral linewidth:

e. Z/Elevation accuracy in meters:

10. Information Applicable to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B section 2.a. is "SAR."

a. Azimuth resolution (ground plane):

b. Range resolution (ground plane):

c. SAR Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR):
