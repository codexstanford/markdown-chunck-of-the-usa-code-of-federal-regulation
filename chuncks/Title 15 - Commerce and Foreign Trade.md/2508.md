####### ยง 700.51 Requests for priority rating authority.
######## Rating authority for production or construction equipment.

(b)(1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the appropriate Delegate Agency. The Delegate Agency may establish particular forms to be used for these requests (e.g., Department of Defense Form DD 691.)

(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.
