() 1 metric ton of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see supplement no. 1 to this part).

(B) In order to trigger a declaration requirement for a past activity (i.e., production, processing or consumption) involving a Schedule 2 chemical, a plant on your plant site must have exceeded the applicable declaration threshold for that particular activity during one or more of the previous three calendar years. For example, if a plant on your plant site produced 800 kilograms of thiodiglycol and consumed 300 kilograms of the same Schedule 2 chemical, during the previous calendar year, you would not have a declaration requirement based on these activities, because neither activity at your plant would have exceeded the declaration threshold of 1 metric ton for that Schedule 2 chemical. However, a declaration requirement would apply if an activity involving a Schedule 2 chemical at the plant exceeded the declaration threshold in an earlier year (i.e., during the course of any other calendar year within the past three calendar years), as indicated in the example provided in the note to this paragraph.
