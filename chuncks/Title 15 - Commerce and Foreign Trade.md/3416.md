() "(See List of Items Controlled)" is in the middle of the ECCN heading. If the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)" appears in the middle of the ECCN heading, then all portions of the heading that follow the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)" will list items controlled in addition to the list in the "items" paragraph. An example of such a heading is ECCN 2B992 Non-"numerically controlled" machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces, (see List of Items Controlled) and "specially designed" "parts" and "components" therefor. Under the ECCN 2B992 example, the "items" paragraph must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the first part of the heading ("non-'numerically controlled' machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces") and classified under 2B992. The second part of the ECCN 2B992 heading ("and 'specially designed' 'parts' and 'components' therefor") contains the exclusive list described in the heading. ECCNs 1A006, 3B992, 4A001, 6A006 and 7A001 are other examples where the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)" appears in the middle of the ECCN heading.
