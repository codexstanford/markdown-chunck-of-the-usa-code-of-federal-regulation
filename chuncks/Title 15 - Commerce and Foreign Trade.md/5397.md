(General Technology Note) -As applied to "technology" or "software," refers to only that portion of "technology" or "software" which is peculiarly responsible for achieving or exceeding the controlled performance levels, characteristics or functions. Such "required" "technology" or "software" may be shared by different products. For example, assume product "X" is controlled on the CCL if it operates at or above 400 MHz and is not controlled if it operates below 400 MHz. If production technologies "A," "B," and "C" allow production at no more than 399 MHz, then technologies "A," "B," and "C" are not "required" to produce the controlled product "X". If technologies "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E" are used together, a manufacturer can produce product "X" that operates at or above 400 MHz. In this example, technologies "D" and "E" are peculiarly responsible for making the controlled product and are thus "required" technology under the General Technology Note. (See the General Technology Note.)
