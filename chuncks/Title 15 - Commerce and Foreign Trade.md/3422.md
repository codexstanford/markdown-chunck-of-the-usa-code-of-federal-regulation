###### ยง 738.4 Determining whether a license is required.
####### Using the CCL and the Country Chart,Overview.

(a)-(1)Once you have determined that your item is classified under a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the "License Requirements" section of that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license is required. Note that not all license requirements set forth under the "License Requirements" section of an ECCN refer you to the Commerce Country Chart, but in some cases this section will contain references to a specific section in the EAR for license requirements. In such cases, this section would not apply.
