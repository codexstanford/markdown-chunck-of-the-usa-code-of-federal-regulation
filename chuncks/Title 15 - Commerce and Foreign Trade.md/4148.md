####### Exceptions.

(d)(1) No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) and (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.

(2) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(2)(vii) through (ix) of this section, "U.S. persons" who are employees of a department or agency of the U.S. Government may 'support' a 'military-intelligence end use' or a 'military-intelligence end user,' as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, or engage in the activities described in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii) through (ix) of this section, if the 'support' is provided in the performance of official duties in furtherance of a U.S. Government program that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means. This paragraph (d)(2) does not authorize a department or agency of the U.S. Government to provide 'support' that is otherwise prohibited by other administrative provisions or by statute. 'Contractor support personnel' of a department or agency of the U.S. Government are eligible for this authorization when in the performance of their duties pursuant to the applicable contract or other official duties. 'Contractor support personnel' for the purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) has the same meaning given to that term in ยง 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of the EAR. This authorization is not available when a department or agency of the U.S. Government acts as an agent on behalf of a non-U.S. Government person.
