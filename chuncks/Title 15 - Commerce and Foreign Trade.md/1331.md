####### Entry number.

(13)The entry number must be reported for goods that are entered in lieu of being transported under bond for which the importer of record is a foreign entity or, for reexports of goods withdrawn from a FTZ for which a NAFTA deferred duty claim (entry type 08) could have been made, but that the importer elected to enter for consumption under CBP entry type 06. For goods imported into the United States for export to a third country of ultimate destination, where the importer of record on the entry is a foreign entity, the USPPI will be the authorized agent designated by the foreign importer for service of process. The USPPI, in this circumstance, is required to report the import entry number.
