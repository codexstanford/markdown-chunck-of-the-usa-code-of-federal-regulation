###### Non-centralized salary offset for Commerce debts.,See,See

(c)When centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, Commerce entities may collect delinquent Commerce debts through non-centralized salary offset.5 CFR 550.1109. In these cases, Commerce entities may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent Commerce debt owed by a Federal employee. If the Federal payment agency is another Commerce entity, the Commerce entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in ยง 19.20(c) of this part. At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of ยง 19.4 of this part. When referring a Commerce debt for offset, Commerce entities will certify to the payment agency, in writing, that the Commerce debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, Commerce entities will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met.5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the due process and other prerequisites for salary offset.
