###### ยง 716.2 Purposes and types of inspections of declared facilities.
####### Routine inspections.

(2)During routine inspections of declared Schedule 3 plant sites, in addition to the verification activities listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Host Team and the Inspection Team may draft site-specific facility agreements for the conduct of subsequent routine inspections (see ยง 716.6 of the CWCR). Although the Convention does not require facility agreements for declared Schedule 3 plant sites, the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a plant site may request one. The Host Team will not seek a facility agreement if the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the plant site does not request one. Subsequent routine inspections will be carried out pursuant to site-specific facility agreements, if applicable.
