###### ยง 717.2 Challenge inspections.
####### Consent to challenge inspections; warrants for challenge inspections.

(a)(1) The owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility may consent to a challenge inspection. The individual giving consent on behalf of the facility represents that he or she has the authority to make this decision for the facility. The facility must respond to the notice of inspection, which includes within it a request for consent to the inspection, within four hours of the facility's receipt of the notice of inspection from BIS.

(2) In instances where the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility does not consent to a challenge inspection, BIS will assist the Department of Justice in seeking a criminal warrant as provided by the Act. The existence of a facility agreement does not in any way limit the right of the operator of the facility to withhold consent to a challenge inspection request.
