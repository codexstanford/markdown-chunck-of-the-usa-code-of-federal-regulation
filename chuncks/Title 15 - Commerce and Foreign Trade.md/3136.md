####### Requests by a substantial segment of an industry.

(3)In determining whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has requested the appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will consider:

(i) The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment of a TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and technology in relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such items; and

(ii) The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production. Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of this supplement) shall consist of:

(A) Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S. producers of the items concerned; or

(B) Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of not less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar value of the items concerned; or

(C) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S. producers of the items concerned, provided that the total of their annual production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar value.

(iii) If it is determined that a substantial segment of the industry concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC concerning a specific grouping of items that the Department of Commerce determines difficult to evaluate for export control purposes, BIS will establish and use the TAC requested.
