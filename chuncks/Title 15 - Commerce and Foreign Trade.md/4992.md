####### Determining Whether a Case is Egregious.

1.In those cases in which a civil monetary penalty is considered appropriate, OEE will make a determination as to whether a case is deemed "egregious" for purposes of the base penalty calculation. If a case is determined to be egregious, OEE also will also determine the appropriate base penalty amount within the range of base penalty amounts prescribed in paragraphs IV.B.2.a.iii and iv below. These determinations will be based on an analysis of the applicable factors. In making these determinations, substantial weight will generally be given to Factors A ("willful or reckless violation of law"), B ("awareness of conduct at issue"), C ("harm to regulatory program objectives"), and D ("individual characteristics"), with particular emphasis on Factors A, B, and C. A case will be considered an "egregious case" where the analysis of the applicable factors, with a focus on Factors A, B, and C, indicates that the case represents a particularly serious violation of the law calling for a strong enforcement response. A determination by OEE that a case is "egregious" must have the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement.
