######## Sale or tranfer of a business

(4)means the sale or transfer of control, whether temporary or permanent, over a firm to which a duty-exemption has been allocated, to any other firm, corporation, partnership, person or other legal entity by any means whatsoever, including, but not limited to, merger and transfer of stock, assets or voting trusts.

(5) New firm is a watch firm not affiliated through ownership or control with any other watch duty-refund recipient. In assessing whether persons or parties are affiliated, the Secretaries will consider the following factors, among others: stock ownership; corporate or family groupings; franchise or joint venture agreements; debt financing; and close supplier relationships. The Secretaries may not find that control exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the potential to affect decisions concerning production, pricing, or cost. Also, no watch duty-refund recipient may own or control more than one jewelry duty-refund recipient. A new entrant is a new watch firm which has received an allocation.
