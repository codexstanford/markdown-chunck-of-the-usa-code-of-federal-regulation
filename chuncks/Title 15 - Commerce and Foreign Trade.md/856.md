## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Commerce
### PART 19 - COMMERCE DEBT COLLECTION
#### Subpart C - Procedures for Offset of Commerce Department Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
##### ยง 19.21 What does a Commerce entity do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a Commerce entity employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?
###### Notice to the creditor agency.

(2)If the employee is separated from the Commerce entity before the debt is paid in full, the Commerce entity will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If the Commerce entity is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Commerce entity will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in ยง 19.9(c) of this part.
