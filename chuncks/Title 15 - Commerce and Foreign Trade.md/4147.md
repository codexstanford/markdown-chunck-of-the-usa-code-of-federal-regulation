###### ยง 744.6 Restrictions on specific activities of "U.S. persons."
####### Additional prohibitions on "U.S. persons" informed by BIS.

(c)(1) BIS may inform "U.S. persons," either individually by specific notice, through amendment to the EAR published in theor through a separate notice published in thethat a license is required because an activity could involve the types of 'support' (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) to the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the "U.S. person" from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, BIS is hereby informing "U.S. persons" that a license is required for the following activities, which could involve 'support' for the weapons of mass destruction-related end uses set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(i) Shipping, transmitting, or transferring (in-country) to or within the PRC or Macau any item not subject to the EAR that you know will be used in the "development" or "production" of integrated circuits at a semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau that fabricates integrated circuits meeting any of the following criteria:

(A) Logic integrated circuits using a non-planar architecture or with a "production" technology node of 16/14 nanometers or less;

(B) NOT-AND (NAND) memory integrated circuits with 128 layers or more; or

(C) Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) integrated circuits using a "production" technology node of 18 nanometer half-pitch or less; or

(ii) Facilitating the shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country) of any item not subject to the EAR that you know will be used in the "development" or "production" of integrated circuits at a semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau that fabricates integrated circuits that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section;

(iii) Servicing any item not subject to the EAR that you know will be used in the "development" or "production" of integrated circuits at a semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau that fabricates integrated circuits that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section;

(iv) Shipping, transmitting, or transferring (in-country) to or within the PRC or Macau any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of any ECCN in Product Groups B, C, D, or E in Category 3 of the CCL that you know will be used in the "development" or "production" of integrated circuits at any semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau, but you do not know whether such semiconductor fabrication "facility" fabricates integrated circuits that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section;

(v) Facilitating the shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country) to or within the PRC or Macau of any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of any ECCN in Product Groups B, C, D, or E in Category 3 of the CCL that you know will be used in the "development" or "production," of integrated circuits at any semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau, but you do not know whether such semiconductor fabrication "facility" fabricates integrated circuits that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section;

(vi) Servicing any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of any ECCN in Product Groups B, C, D, or E in Category 3 of the CCL that you know will be used in the "development" or "production" of integrated circuits at any semiconductor fabrication "facility" located in the PRC or Macau, but you do not know whether such semiconductor fabrication "facility" fabricates integrated circuits that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section;

(vii) Shipping, transmitting, or transferring (in-country) to or within the PRC or Macau any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of ECCN 3B090, 3D001 (for 3B090), or 3E001 (for 3B090) regardless of end use or end user;

(viii) Facilitating the shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country) to or within the PRC or Macau of any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of ECCN 3B090, 3D001 (for 3B090), or 3E001 (for 3B090), regardless of end use or end user; or

(ix) Servicing any item not subject to the EAR located in the PRC or Macau and meeting the parameters of ECCN 3B090, 3D001 (for 3B090), or 3E001 (for 3B090), regardless of end use or end user.
