####### Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of documents.

(b)A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party may apply to the ALJ for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall be made at least 30 calendar days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless the ALJ specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the ALJ at least 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 business days after service, or within such additional time as the ALJ may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot either admit or deny such matters.
