####### Declaration or report form.

Means a multi-purpose form to be submitted to BIS regarding activities involving Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3, or unscheduled discrete organic chemicals. Declaration forms will be used by facilities that have data declaration obligations under the CWCR and are "declared" facilities whose facility-specific information will be transmitted to the OPCW. Report forms will be used by entities that are "undeclared" facilities or trading companies that have limited reporting requirements for only export and import activities under the CWCR and whose facility-specific information will not be transmitted to the OPCW. Information from declared facilities, undeclared facilities and trading companies will also be used to compile U.S. national aggregate figures on the production, processing, consumption, export and import of specific chemicals. See also related definitions of declared facility, undeclared facility and report.
