####### Top caps/Bottom caps:,Explanatory Note

(e)Disc-shaped components of between 75 mm (3 in) and 400 mm (16 in) diameter specially designed or prepared to fit to the ends of the rotor tube, and so contain the UFwithin the rotor tube, and in some cases to support, retain or contain as an integrated part an element of the upper bearing (top cap) or to carry the rotating elements of the motor and lower bearing (bottom cap), and manufactured from one of the high strength to density ratio materials described in theto section 5.1.1 of this supplement.

(a) Maraging steel capable of an ultimate tensile strength of 2.05 x 10N/m(300,000 psi) or more;

(b) Aluminum alloys capable of an ultimate tensile strength of 0.46 x 10N/m(67,000 psi) or more;

(c) Filamentary materials suitable for use in composite structures and having a specific modulus of 12.3 x 10m or greater and a specific ultimate tensile strength of 0.3 x 10m or greater ("Specific Modulus" is the Young's Modulus in N/mdivided by the specific weight in N/m; "Specific Ultimate Tensile Strength" is the ultimate tensile strength in N/mdivided by the specific weight in N/m).
