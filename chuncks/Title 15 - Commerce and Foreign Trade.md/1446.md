(ii) The maps must be furnished to the Census Bureau within 30 calendar days after the government authority signs the contract.

(iii) The Bureau will review the maps and, if revision is necessary, return them within 30 calendar days to the government authority.

(iv) Within 30 calendar days thereafter, the revised maps must be transmitted to the Bureau and, if they are still inadequate and must therefore be redrafted by the Bureau, the above-mentioned surcharge of $300 per map sheet requiring revision will be imposed.
