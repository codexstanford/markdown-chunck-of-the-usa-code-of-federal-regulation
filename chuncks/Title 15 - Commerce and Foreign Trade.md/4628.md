##### PART 758 - EXPORT CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
###### ยง 758.1 The Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES).
####### Notation on export documents for exports exempt from EEI filing requirements.

(d)When an exemption from filing the EEI applies, the export authority (license exception or NLR) of all the items must be entered on the loading document (e.g., Cargo Declaration, manifest, bill of lading, (master) air waybill) by the person responsible for preparing the document, see 15 CFR 30.35 of the FTR. This requirement is intended to parallel the Bureau of Census requirement, so that notations as to the basis for the EEI exemption and the license authority are entered in the same place and manner (see 15 CFR 30.45(e) and (f) of the FTR for detailed requirements). The loading document must be available for inspection by government officials, along with the items, prior to lading on the carrier.
