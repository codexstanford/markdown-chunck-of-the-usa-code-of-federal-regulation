####### Sample rate.

(Cat 3) For an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) the maximum number of samples that are measured at the analog input over a period of one second, except for oversampling ADCs. For oversampling ADCs the "sample rate" is taken to be its output word rate. "Sample rate" may also be referred to as sampling rate, usually specified in Mega Samples Per Second (MSPS) or Giga Samples Per Second (GSPS), or conversion rate, usually specified in Hertz (Hz).
