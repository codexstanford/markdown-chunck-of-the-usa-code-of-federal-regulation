(3)(i) Consistent with the MTCR AnnexMTCR Annexand ยง 750.7(c)(1)(x) of the EAR, the approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license of the minimum "software," excluding source code, controlled for MT reasons that is required for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the item and the "technology" required for the installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of the item in order to ensure the item's safe operation as originally intended. The approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the later export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of "software" controlled for MT reasons intended to correct defects (bug fixes) in a previously legally exported item under a BIS license to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license, provided that the capability and/or performance of the item are not otherwise enhanced. This MT licensing policy is implemented concurrent with ยง 750.7(c)(1)(x) because it applies to all MT licenses, except when a condition is placed on the license which excludes the use of ยง 750.7(c)(1)(x), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
