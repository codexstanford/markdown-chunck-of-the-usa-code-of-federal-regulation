####### Tools of trade-technology.,e.g.,

(2)Technology to be used by a 'U.S. person' exporter or reexporter or its employees who are traveling to or on temporary assignment in Cuba for the installation, servicing or repair of items that are subject to the EAR and that have been exported or reexported to Cuba under a license or license exception, or foreign-origin items that are not subject to the EAR that are owned and used exclusively by private sector entities in Cuba, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f). For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a 'U.S. person' is: an individual who is a citizen of the United States, an individual who is "lawfully admitted for permanent residence" in the United States as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or an individual who is a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). 'U.S. person' also means any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States, or any jurisdiction within the United States (corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization or group that is authorized to do business in the United States). If the employee who will use the technology is not a 'U.S. person,' the release of that technology to that employee must either not require a license or be authorized by a license or a license exception other than this section before it may be exported or reexported to that employee under this paragraph. The exporter or reexporter and the recipient of the technology must take security precautions to protect against unauthorized release of the technology while the technology is being shipped or transmitted and used overseas. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:

(i) Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for email and other business activities that involve the transmission and use of the technology authorized under this license exception;

(ii) Use of password systems on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception; and

(iii) Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception.
