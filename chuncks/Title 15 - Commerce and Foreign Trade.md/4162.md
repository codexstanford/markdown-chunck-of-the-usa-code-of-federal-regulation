(b)BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter, or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer of commodities described in ECCNs 0A504 (incorporating commodities controlled by ECCNs 6A002 or 6A003, or commodities controlled by 6A993.a that meet the criterion of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), 6A002, 6A003, or 6A993.a (having a maximum frame rate equal to or less than 9 Hz and thus meeting the criteria of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), or 8A002.d to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the users or unauthorized incorporation into the "military commodities" described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration.
