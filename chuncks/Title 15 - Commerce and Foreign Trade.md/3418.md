####### Scope.

(a)The Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine the Commerce Control List (CCL) export and reexport license requirements for most items listed on the CCL. Such license requirements are based on the Reasons for Control listed in the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to the item. Some ECCNs, however, impose license requirements either without reference to a reason for control code that is listed on the Commerce Country Chart, or in addition to such a reference. Those ECCNs may state their license requirements in full in their "Reasons for Control" sections or they may refer the reader to another provision of the EAR for license requirement information. In addition, some ECCNs do not impose license requirements, but refer the reader to the regulations of another government agency that may impose license requirements on the items described in that ECCN.

(1) ECCNs 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980. A license is required for all destinations for items controlled under these entries. For items controlled by 0A983, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980, no license exceptions apply. For items controlled by 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))) and 5D980, License Exception GOV may apply if your item is consigned to and for the official use of an agency of the U.S. Government (see ยง 740.2(a)(3)). If your item is controlled by 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) or 5E980 you should proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license application instructions and ยง 742.11 or ยง 742.13 of the EAR for information on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.
