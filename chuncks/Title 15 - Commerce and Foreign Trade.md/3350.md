####### Additional Information.

(c)Because this is only a model certification, exporters, reexporters, or transferors may add additional elements to the certification and/or use it for multiple purposes as part of their compliance program. For example, if a company has ten affiliated companies in a multi-step supply chain, instead of obtaining a model certification for each export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), the initial exporter, reexporter, or transferor may get all ten parties to sign the certification, which may further reduce the burden on parties participating in the supply chain.
