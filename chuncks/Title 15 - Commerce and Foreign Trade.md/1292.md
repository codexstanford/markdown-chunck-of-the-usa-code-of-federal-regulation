####### Port of export.

(9)The port of export is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seaport or airport where the goods are loaded on the carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States, or the CBP port where exports by overland transportation cross the U.S. border into Canada or Mexico. For EEI reporting purposes only, for goods loaded aboard a conveyance (aircraft or vessel) that stops at several ports before clearing to the foreign country, the port of export is the first port where the goods were loaded on this conveyance. For goods off-loaded from the original conveyance to another conveyance (even if the aircraft or vessel belongs to the same carrier) at any of the ports, the port where the goods were loaded on the last conveyance before going foreign is the port of export. The port of export shall be reported in terms of Schedule D, "Classification of CBP Districts and Ports." Use port code 8000 for shipments by mail.
