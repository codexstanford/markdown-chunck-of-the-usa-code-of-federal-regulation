####### Cuba.

(1)All the items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) require a license to Cuba. In addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the CCL, designated by the Number "EAR99", require a license to Cuba. Most items requiring a license to these destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.
