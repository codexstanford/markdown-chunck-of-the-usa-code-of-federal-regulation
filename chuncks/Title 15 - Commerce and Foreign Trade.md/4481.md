####### Numerical control devices, motion control boards, numerically controlled machine tools, dimensional inspection machines, direct numerical control systems, specially designed assemblies and specially designed software.

(h)(1) If you are submitting a license application to export, reexport, or request BIS to classify numerical control devices, motion control boards, numerically controlled machine tools, dimensional inspection machines, and specially designed software you must include the following information in your license application:

(i) For numerical control devices and motion control boards:

(A) Make and model number of the control unit;

(B) Description and internal configuration of numerical control device. If the device is a computer with motion control board(s), then include the make and model number of the computer;

(C) Description of the manner in which a computer will be connected to the CNC unit for on-line processing of CAD data. Specify the make and model of the computer;

(D) Number of axes the control unit is capable of simultaneously controlling in a coordinated contouring mode, and type of interpolation (linear, circular, and other);

(E) Minimum programmable increment;

(F) A description and an itemized list of all software/firmware to be supplied with the control device or motion control board, including software/firmware for axis interpolation function and for any programmable control unit or device to be supplied with the control unit;

(G) Description of capabilities related to "real time processing" and receiving computer aided-design;

(H) A description of capability to accept additional boards or software that would permit an upgrade of the electronic device or motion control board above the control levels specified in ECCN 2B001; and

(I) Specify if the electronic device has been downgraded, and if so can it be upgraded in future.

(ii) For numerically controlled machine tools and dimensional inspection machines:

(A) Name and model number of machine tool or dimensional inspection machine;

(B) Type of equipment, e.g., horizontal boring machine, machining center, dimensional inspection machine, turning center, water jet, etc.;

(C) Description of the linear and rotary axes capable of being simultaneously controlled in a coordinated contouring mode, regardless of the fact that the coordinated movement of the machine axis may be limited by the numerical control unit supplied by the machine tool;

(D) Maximum workpiece diameter for cylindrical grinding machines;

(E) Motion (camming) of the spindle axis measured in the axial direction in one revolution of the spindle, and a description of the method of measurement for turning machine tools only;

(F) Motion (run out) of the spindle axis measured in the radial direction in one revolution of the spindle, and a description of the method of measurement;

(G) Overall positioning accuracy in each axis, and a description of the method for measurement; and

(H) Slide motion test results.
