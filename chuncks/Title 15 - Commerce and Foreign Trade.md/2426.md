####### Procedures for determination of violations and imposition of fines.

(d)When the Board or the Executive Secretary has reason to believe that a violation pursuant to §§ 400.62(b) and (c) has occurred and that the violation warrants the imposition of a fine (such as a situation where a party has previously been notified of action required for compliance and has failed to take such action within a reasonable period of time), the following steps shall be taken:

(1) The Executive Secretary shall notify the party or parties responsible for the violation and the zone grantee in writing stating the nature of the alleged violation, and provide the party(ies) a specified period (no less than 30 days, with consideration given to any requests for an extension, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) to respond in writing;

(2) The Executive Secretary shall conduct a hearing, if requested or otherwise if appropriate. Parties may be represented by counsel at the hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding shall be presented. A transcript of the hearing shall be produced and a copy shall be made available to the parties;

(3) The Executive Secretary shall make a recommendation on the record of the proceeding not earlier than the later of 15 days after the deadline for the party(ies)'s response under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or 15 days after the date of a hearing held under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the recommendation is for an affirmative determination of a violation, the Executive Secretary shall also recommend the amount of the fine to be imposed; and

(4) The Board shall make a determination regarding the finding of a violation and imposition of a fine based on the Executive Secretary's recommendation under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For related actions where the total sum of recommended fines is no more than 10,000 dollars (50,000 dollars in the case of violations pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section), the Board delegates to the Executive Secretary the authority to make a determination.
