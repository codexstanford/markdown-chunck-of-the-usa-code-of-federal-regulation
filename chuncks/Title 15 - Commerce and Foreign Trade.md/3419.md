####### Countries.

(b)The first column of the Country Chart lists countries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations that are not listed in the Country Chart contained in supplement no. 1 to part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and such destination is a territory, possession, dependency or department of a country included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the same licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory, possession, dependency or department. For example, if your destination is the Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, refer to the United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements. In addition, if your destination is Liechtenstein, which serves as one territory with Switzerland for purposes of the EAR, refer to Switzerland on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.
