###### ยง 738.2 Commerce Control List (CCL) structure.
####### Items.,1,2,3

(C)This paragraph describes the relationship between the "items" paragraph and ECCN headings and will assist your understanding as you classify items on the CCL. When the heading contains the phrase "see List of Items Controlled," the portion of the heading preceding that phrase is only a summary of the items controlled by the ECCN and the "items" paragraph contains an exclusive list of items described in the heading. Paragraphs (d)(2)(iv)(C)(), () and () of this section provide examples of the three different uses of the phrase "(see List of Items Controlled)" in ECCN headings. Each heading on the CCL uses one of these three structures. Understanding the relationship between the heading and the "items" paragraph is important when classifying items that are "subject to the EAR" on the CCL.
