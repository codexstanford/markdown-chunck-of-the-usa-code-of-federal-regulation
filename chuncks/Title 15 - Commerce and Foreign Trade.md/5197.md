####### Component.

This is an item that is useful only when used in conjunction with an "end item." "Components" are also commonly referred to as assemblies. For purposes of this definition an assembly and a "component" are the same. There are two types of "components": "Major components" and "minor components." A "major component" includes any assembled element which forms a portion of an "end item" without which the "end item" is inoperable. For example, for an automobile, "components" will include the engine, transmission, and battery. If you do not have all those items, the automobile will not function, or function as effectively. A "minor component" includes any assembled element of a "major component." "Components" consist of "parts." References in the CCL to "components" include both "major components" and "minor components."
