The pivot is normally a hardened steel shaft with a hemisphere at one end with a means of attachment to the bottom cap, described in section 5.1.1(e) of this Supplement, at the other. The shaft may however have a hydrodynamic bearing attached. The cup is pellet-shaped with a hemispherical indentation in one surface. These components are often supplied separately to the damper.
