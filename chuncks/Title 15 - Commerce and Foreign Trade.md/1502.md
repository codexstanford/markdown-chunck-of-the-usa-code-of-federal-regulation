####### Accuracy and stability.

(f)The time and frequency broadcasts are controlled by the NIST atomic frequency standards, which realize the internationally defined cesium resonance frequency with an accuracy of 1 part in 10. The frequencies transmitted by WWV and WWVH are held stable to better than +/-2 parts in 10at all times. Deviations at WWV are normally less than 1 part in 10from day to day. Incremental frequency adjustments not exceeding 1 part in 10are made at WWV and WWVH as necessary. Changes in the propagation medium (causing Doppler effect, diurnal shifts, etc.) result in fluctuations in the carrier frequencies as received which may be very much greater than the uncertainties described above.
