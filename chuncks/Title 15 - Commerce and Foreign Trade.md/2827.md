###### ยง 713.2 Annual declaration requirements for plant sites that produce, process or consume Schedule 2 chemicals in excess of specified thresholds.
####### Quantities to be declared,Production, processing and consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical above the declaration threshold,Annual declaration on past activities.

(c)-(1)-(i)If you are required to complete forms pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, you must declare the aggregate quantity resulting from each type of activity (production, processing or consumption) from each plant on your plant site that exceeds the applicable threshold for that Schedule 2 chemical. Do not include in these aggregate production, processing, and consumption quantities any data from plants on the plant site that did not individually produce, process or consume a Schedule 2 chemical in amounts greater than the applicable threshold. For example, if a plant on your plant site produced a Schedule 2 chemical in an amount greater than the applicable declaration threshold during the previous calendar year, you would have to declare only the production quantity from that plant, provided that the total amount of the Schedule 2 chemical processed or consumed at the plant did not exceed the applicable declaration threshold during any one of the previous three calendar years. If in the previous calendar year your production, processing and consumption activities all were below the applicable declaration threshold, but your declaration requirement is triggered because of production activities occurring in an earlier year, you would declare "0" only for the declared production activities.
