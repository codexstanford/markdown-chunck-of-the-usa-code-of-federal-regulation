(2)

(i) Where continued use of DDTC authorization is not or is no longer an available option, or a holder of an existing DDTC authorization returns or terminates that authorization, any required authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) a transitioned item on or after the effective date of the applicable final rule must be obtained under the EAR. Following the publication date and prior to the effective date of a final rule moving an item from the USML to the CCL, applicants may submit license applications to BIS for authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) the transitioning item. BIS will process the license applications in accordance with ยง 750.4 of the EAR, hold the license application without action (HWA) if necessary, and issue a license, if approved, to the applicant no sooner than the effective date of the final rule transitioning the items to the CCL.

(ii) Following the effective date of a final rule moving items from the USML to the CCL, exporters, reexporters, and transferors of such items may return DDTC licenses in accordance with ยง 123.22 of the ITAR or terminate Technical Assistance Agreements, Manufacturing License Agreements, or Warehouse and Distribution Agreements in accordance with ยง 124.6 of the ITAR and thereafter export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) such items under applicable provisions of the EAR, including any applicable license requirements. No transfer (in-country) may be made of an item exported under a DDTC authorization containing provisos or other limitations without a license issued by BIS unless (i) the transfer (in-country) is authorized by an EAR license exception and the terms and conditions of the License Exception have been satisfied, or (ii) no license would otherwise be required under the EAR to export or reexport the item to the new end user.
