###### ยง 743.6 Prior notifications to Congress of exports of certain semiautomatic firearms.
####### License application information.

(c)In addition to information required on the application, the exporter must include a copy of the signed contract or, if there is no contract, a written explanation from the applicant (including a statement of the value of the firearms controlled by ECCN 0A501.a to be exported) for any proposed export described in paragraph (b) of this section. License applications for semiautomatic firearms controlled by ECCN 0A501.a may include other nonautomatic firearms, shotguns, other 0x5zz items, or other items subject to the EAR, but the applicant must clearly identify the semiautomatic firearms controlled by ECCN 0A501.a. The applicant clearly distinguishing the semiautomatic firearms controlled by ECCN 0A501.a from any other items on the license application will assist BIS in assessing whether the license application requires congressional notification under this section and identifying the information that will need to be reported to Congress. Any activity intended to circumvent notification requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited to, the splitting or structuring of contracts to avoid exceeding applicable notification dollar value limits described in paragraph (a) of this section.
