####### Prohibition or restriction.

(c)Upon review, if a finding is made that zone activity is no longer in the public interest (taking into account the factors enumerated in ยง 400.27 where production activity is involved), the Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance may prohibit or restrict the activity in question. Such prohibitions or restrictions may be put in place after a preliminary review (e.g., prior to potential steps such as a public comment period) if circumstances warrant such action until further review can be completed. The procedures of ยง 400.34(a)(5)(iv)(A) shall be followed to notify the grantee of the affected zone and allow for a response prior to the final imposition of a prohibition or restriction. The appropriateness of a delayed effective date shall be considered.
