### PART 19 - COMMERCE DEBT COLLECTION
#### Subpart C - Procedures for Offset of Commerce Department Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
##### ยง 19.20 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by a Commerce entity?
###### Offset of Commerce entity payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.

(a)(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by Commerce entities and other Federal agencies, a process known as "centralized offset." When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a Commerce entity (when acting as a "payment agency") to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Commerce entity, including salary payments issued to Commerce entity employees. This section and ยง 19.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks a Commerce entity to offset a payment issued by the Commerce entity to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
