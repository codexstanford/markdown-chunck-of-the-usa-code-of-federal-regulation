###### ยง 774.1 Introduction.
####### Conventions related to the use of quotation marks on the CCL.

(d)The use of double quotation marks on the CCL is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the CCL that are defined in part 772 (Definitions of Terms), or for purposes of ECCNs, where a definition is provided in the "related definitions" paragraph in the License Requirements section of ECCNs or sometimes in Notes and Technical Notes for particular ECCNs and that definition is specific to that particular ECCN. In this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the CCL that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. It is also a useful compliance practice to review the "Related Definitions" paragraph and Notes and Technical Notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular ECCN.
