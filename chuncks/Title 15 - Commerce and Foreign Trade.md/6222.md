(a)The Additional Protocol is a supplement to the existing U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which entered into force in 1980. It provides the IAEA with access to additional information about civil nuclear and nuclear-related items, materials, and activities and with physical access to reportable locations where nuclear facilities, materials, or ores are located (to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities) and to other reportable locations and locations specified by the IAEA (to resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the U.S. Declaration). The Additional Protocol is based upon and is virtually identical to the IAEA Model Additional Protocol (see IAEA Information Circular, INFCIRC/540, at), except that it excludes IAEA access to activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or to locations or information associated with such activities, and provides for managed access in connection with those same activities and to locations or information associated with those activities.
