(8)The carrier identification is the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) for vessel, rail, and truck shipments or the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code for air shipments. The carrier identification specifies the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. The carrier transporting the goods to the port of export and the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States may be different. For vessel shipments, report the carrier identification code of the party whose booking number was reported in the AES. For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the carrier identification is that of the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. For modes other than vessel, air, rail and truck valid methods of transportation, including but not limited to mail, fixed transport (pipeline), and passenger hand carried, the carrier identification is not required. The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) issues and maintains the SCAC. (See) The IATA issues and maintains the IATA codes. (Seefor a list of IATA codes.)
