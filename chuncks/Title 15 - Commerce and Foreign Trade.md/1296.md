####### Commodity description.

(13)Report the description of the goods shipped in English in sufficient detail to permit verification of the Schedule B or HTSUSA number. Clearly and fully state the name of the commodity in terms that can be identified or associated with the language used in Schedule B or HTSUSA (usually the commercial name of the commodity), and any and all characteristics of the commodity that distinguish it from commodities of the same name covered by other Schedule B or HTSUSA classifications. If the shipment requires a license, the description reported in the EEI shall conform with that shown on the license. If the shipment qualifies for a license exemption, the description shall be sufficient to ensure compliance with that license exemption. However, where the description on the license does not state all of the characteristics of the commodity that are needed to completely verify the commodity classification number, as described in this paragraph, report the missing characteristics, as well as the description shown on the license, in the commodity description field of the EEI.
