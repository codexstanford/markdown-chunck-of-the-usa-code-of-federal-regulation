####### Methodology and evidence.

(b)The evaluation of an application for production authority shall include the following steps:

(1) The first phase (§ 400.27(a)) involves consideration of threshold factors. If an examiner or reviewer makes a negative finding on any of the factors in § 400.27(a) in the course of a review, the applicant shall be informed pursuant to § 400.34(a)(5)(iv)(A). When threshold factors are the basis for a negative recommendation in a review of ongoing activity, the zone grantee and directly affected party shall be notified and given an opportunity to submit evidence pursuant to § 400.34(a)(5)(iv)(A). If the Board determines in the negative regarding any of the factors in § 400.27(a), it shall deny or restrict authority for the proposed or ongoing activity.

(2) The second phase (§ 400.27(b)) involves consideration of the enumerated economic factors, taking into account their relative weight and significance under the circumstances. Previous evaluations in similar cases shall be considered.
