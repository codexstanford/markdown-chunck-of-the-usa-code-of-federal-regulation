####### Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements of war.

(g)Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S. Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following, which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce:

(1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity by means of excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing, cutting, or by any other method are "scrap".

(2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armed services as "scrap", whether or not they have been heated, flame-treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any other method.

(3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions List are "scrap", and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling, crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should consult the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.
