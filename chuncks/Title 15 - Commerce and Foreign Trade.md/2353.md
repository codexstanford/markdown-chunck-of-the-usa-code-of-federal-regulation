###### ยง 400.27 Criteria applicable to evaluation of applications for production authority.
####### Threshold factors.

(a)It is the policy of the Board to authorize zone activity only when it is consistent with public policy and, in regard to activity involving foreign merchandise subject to quotas or inverted tariffs, when zone procedures are not the sole determining cause of imports. Thus, without undertaking a review of the economic factors enumerated in ยง 400.27(b), the Board shall deny or restrict authority for proposed or ongoing activity if it determines that:

(1) The activity is inconsistent with U.S. trade and tariff law, or policy which has been formally adopted by the Executive branch;

(2) Board approval of the activity under review would seriously prejudice U.S. tariff and trade negotiations or other initiatives; or

(3) The activity involves items subject to quantitative import controls or inverted tariffs, and the use of zone procedures would be the direct and sole cause of imports that, but for such procedures, would not likely otherwise have occurred, taking into account imports both as individual items and as components of imported products.
