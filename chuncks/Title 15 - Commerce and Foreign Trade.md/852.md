##### ยง 19.20 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by a Commerce entity?
###### Priority of debts owed to Commerce entity.

(h)For purposes of this section, debts owed to a Commerce entity generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. The Commerce entity that has been asked to offset the payments may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to a Commerce entity. The Commerce entity that has been asked to offset the payments will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.
