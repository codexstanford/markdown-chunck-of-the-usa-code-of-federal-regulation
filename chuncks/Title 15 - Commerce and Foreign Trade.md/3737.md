####### Status of pending AGR notification requests.,https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/stela

(5)You must contact BIS's System for Tracking Export License Applications (STELA) () for status of your pending AGR notification or verify the status in BIS's Simplified Network Applications Processing Redesign (SNAP-R) System. STELA will provide the date of registration of the AGR notification. If no department or agency objection is raised within 11 business days, STELA will, on the twelfth business day following the date of registration, provide you with confirmation of that fact. You may not proceed with your shipment unless you confirm with either STELA or SNAP-R that no objection has been raised. If an objection is raised, STELA and SNAP-R will indicate that a license is required. The AGR notification will then be processed as a license application. In addition, BIS may provide notice of an objection by telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.
