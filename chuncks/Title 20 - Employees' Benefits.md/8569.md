###### ยง 416.1165 How we deem income to you from your ineligible parent(s).
####### When you are the only eligible child.

(e)(1)If you are the only eligible child in the household, we deem any of your parents' current monthly income that remains to be your unearned income. We combine it with your own unearned income and apply the exclusions in ยง 416.1124 to determine your countable unearned income in the month. We add this to any countable earned income you may have and subtract the total from the Federal benefit rate for an individual to determine whether you are eligible for benefits.
