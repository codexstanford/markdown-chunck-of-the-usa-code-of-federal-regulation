A clinical psychologist may serve as a physician within the scope of his or her practice as defined by state law. Therefore, a clinical psychologist may not serve as a physician for conditions that include a physical component unless the applicable state law allows clinical psychologists to treat physical conditions. A clinical psychologist may also perform testing, evaluation, and other services under the direction of a qualified physician.
