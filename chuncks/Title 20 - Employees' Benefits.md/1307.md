###### ยง 220.128 Age as a vocational factor.
####### General.,Age

(a)(1)refers to how old the claimaint is (chronological age) and the extent to which his or her age affects his or her ability to-

(i) Adapt to a new work situation; and

(ii) Do work in competition with others.

(2) In determining disability, the Board does not consider age alone. The Board must also consider the claimant's residual functional capacity, education, and work experience. If the claimant is unemployed because of his or her age and can still do a significant number of jobs which exist in the national economy, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled. Appendix 2 of this part explains in detail how the Board considers age as a vocational factor. However, the Board does not apply these age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.
