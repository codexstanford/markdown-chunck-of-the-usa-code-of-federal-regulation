##### ยง 404.412 After my benefits are reduced for age when and how will adjustments to that reduction be made?
###### When is the adjustment made?

(b)We make automatic adjustments in benefits to exclude the months of entitlement described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section from consideration when determining the amount by which such benefits are reduced. Each year we examine beneficiary records to identify when an individual has attained full retirement age and one or more months described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section occurred prior to such age during the period of entitlement to benefits reduced for age. Increases in benefit amounts based upon this adjustment are effective with the month of attainment of full retirement age. In the case of widow's or widower's benefits, this adjustment is made in the month of attainment of age 62 as well as the month of attainment of full retirement age.
