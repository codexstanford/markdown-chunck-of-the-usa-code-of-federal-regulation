####### Your impairment(s) must prevent you from making an adjustment to any other work.

(g)(1) If we find that you cannot do your past relevant work because you have a severe impairment(s) (or you do not have any past relevant work), we will consider the same residual functional capacity assessment we made under paragraph (e) of this section, together with your vocational factors (your age, education, and work experience) to determine if you can make an adjustment to other work. (See ยง 404.1560(c).) If you can make an adjustment to other work, we will find you not disabled. If you cannot, we will find you disabled.

(2) We use different rules if you meet one of the two special medical-vocational profiles described in ยง 404.1562. If you meet one of those profiles, we will find that you cannot make an adjustment to other work, and that you are disabled.
