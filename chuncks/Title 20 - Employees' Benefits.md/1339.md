####### Semi-skilled work.

(c)Semi-skilled work is work which needs some skills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. A job may be classified as semi-skilled where coordination and dexterity are necessary, as when hand or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive tasks. Semi-skilled jobs may require-

(1) Alertness and close attention to watching machine processes;

(2) Inspecting, testing, or otherwise looking for irregularities;

(3) Tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons against loss, damage, or injury; or

(4) Other types of activities which are similarly less complex than skilled work but more complex than unskilled work.
