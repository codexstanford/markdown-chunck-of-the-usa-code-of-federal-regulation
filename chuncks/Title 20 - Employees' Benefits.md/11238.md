###### Training enrollment deadlines.

(a)As a condition for receiving Basic TRA, an AAW must meet the participation in approved training requirement in ยง 618.720(g)(1) no later than the latest of:

(1) The last day of the 26th week after the AAW's most recent qualifying separation;

(2) The last day of the 26th week after the week in which the certification was issued; or

(3) 45 days after the later of the dates specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, if there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension of the enrollment period. Extenuating circumstances that justify the 45-day extension are circumstances that would constitute good cause, as established by ยง 618.730; that is, circumstances under which the AAW acted diligently yet was unable to enroll because of exigent circumstances.

(4) In the case of an AAW who fails to enroll by the date required by paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section due to a failure by the State to provide the AAW with timely information regarding the applicable training enrollment deadline, the AAW must be enrolled in training or obtain a waiver by the Monday of the first week occurring 60 consecutive calendar days following the date the worker was properly notified; or

(5) The Monday of the first week occurring 30 consecutive calendar days (or, if the State is closed that last day because that day falls on a weekend or holiday or for any other reason, the next business day) following the day of termination, whether by revocation or expiration or revocation of a waiver under ยง 618.735.
