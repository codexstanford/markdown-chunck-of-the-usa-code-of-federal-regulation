##### ยง 672.110 What definitions apply to this part?
###### Partnership.

The term "partnership" means an agreement that involves a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or letter of commitment submitted by each organization and applicant, as defined in the YouthBuild Transfer Act, that plan on working together as partners in a YouthBuild program. Each partner must have a clearly defined role. These roles must be verified through a letter of commitment, not just a letter of support, or an MOU submitted by each partner. The letter of commitment or MOU must detail the role the partner will play in the YouthBuild Program, including the partner's specific responsibilities and resources committed, if appropriate. These letters or MOUs must clearly indicate the partnering organization's unique contribution and commitment to the YouthBuild Program.
