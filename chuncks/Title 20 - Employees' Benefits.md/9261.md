(6) To determine whether a State's expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of SSI benefits are not less than the State's expenditures for the payments in the preceding 12-month period, in computing the State's expenditures, we disregard, pursuant to a one-time election of the State, all expenditures by the State for the retroactive supplementary payments that are required to be made under thev.493 U.S. 521 (1990) class action.
