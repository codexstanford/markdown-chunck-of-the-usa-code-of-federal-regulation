###### ยง 404.1579 How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends.
####### You are currently engaging in substantial gainful activity.

(4)If you are currently engaging in substantial gainful activity before we determine whether you are no longer disabled because of your work activity, we will consider whether you are entitled to a trial work period as set out in ยง 404.1592. We will find that your disability has ended in the month in which you demonstrated your ability to engage in substantial gainful activity (following completion of a trial work period, where it applies). This exception does not apply in determining whether you continue to have a disabling impairment(ยง 404.1511) for purposes of deciding your eligibility for a reentitlement period (ยง 404.1592a).
