###### ยง 404.1594 How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends.
####### Substantial evidence shows that you have undergone vocational therapy (related to your ability to work).

(2)Vocational therapy (related to your ability to work) may include, but is not limited to, additional education, training, or work experience that improves your ability to meet the vocational requirements of more jobs. This decision will be based on substantial evidence which includes new medical evidence and a new residual functional capacity assessment. (See ยง 404.1545.) If, at the time of our review you have not completed vocational therapy which could affect the continuance of your disability, we will review your claim upon completion of the therapy.
