###### Compromise of a nerve root(s) of the lumbar spine.

c.Compromise of a nerve root as it exits the lumbar spine between the vertebrae may limit the functioning of the associated lower extremity. The physical examination reproduces the related symptoms based on radicular signs and clinical tests. When a nerve root of the lumbar spine is compromised, we require a positive straight-leg raising test (also known as a Las&#xE8;gue test) in both supine and sitting positions appropriate to the specific lumbar nerve root that is compromised.
