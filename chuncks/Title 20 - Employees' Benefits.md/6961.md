###### ยง 408.220 Do you have other benefit income?
####### When other benefit payments are considered to be similar payments from the same or a related source.

(b)Payments are similar payments from the same or a related source if they are received from sources substantially related to the sources of income received before you became entitled to SVB. For example, if you received U.S. Social Security spouse's benefits in the 12-month period before you filed your application for SVB and these were changed to widower's benefits after you became entitled to SVB, we would consider this to be from the same or a related source.
