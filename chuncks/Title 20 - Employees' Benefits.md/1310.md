###### ยง 220.128 Age as a vocational factor.
####### Person of advanced age.

(d)The Board considers that advanced age (55 or over) is the point at which age significantly affects the claimant's ability to do substantial gainful activity.

(1) If the claimant is severly impaired and of advanced age, and he or she cannot do medium work (see ยง 220.132), the claimant may not be able to work unless he or she has skills that can be used in less demanding jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.

(2) If the claimant is close to retirement age (60-64) and has a severe impairment, the Board will not consider him or her able to adjust to sedentary or light work unless the claimant has skills which are highly marketable.
