(d)Even though conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section apply because your impairment is no longer disabling or you are no longer blind under ยง 416.986(a)(1), (a)(2) or (b), we will not suspend your benefits for this reason if-

(1) You are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, as described in ยง 416.1338(c) and (d);

(2) You began participating in the program before the date your disability or blindness ended; and
