####### What you must do to receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision.

(d)(1) To receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision on our reconsideration determination, you must request a hearing and continuation of benefits no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our reconsideration determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. A hearing must be requested as provided in ยง 416.1433, and you must request continued benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) If you fail to request a hearing and continued benefits within the 10-day period required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but you later ask that we continue your benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision, we will use the rules as provided in ยง 416.1411 to determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after receipt of the reconsideration determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the delayed request to be timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.
