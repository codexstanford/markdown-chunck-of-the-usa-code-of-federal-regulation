####### Making service available to the general public.

(18)The fact that an individual makes his or her services available to the general public on a regular and consistent basis rather than to one employer indicates that the individual is self-employed rather than an employee of any one firm. An individual may make services available to the public by working from his or her own office with assistants, from his or her own home, by holding business licenses, by a listing in a business directory, or by advertising.
