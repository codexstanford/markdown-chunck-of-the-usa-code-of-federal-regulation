###### Payments to local lodge officials.

(e)A payment by a local lodge of a labor organization to an employee for services as a local lodge official shall be regarded as subsidiary remuneration if such payment does not exceed an average of $15 a day for the period with respect to which it is payable or accrues, unless there is information that the work from which the payment is derived does not require substantially less than full time as determined by generally prevailing standards, or is not susceptible of performance at such times and under such circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time employment in another occupation.
