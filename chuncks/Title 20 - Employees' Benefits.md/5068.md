####### When the provisions of this section are available.

(b)(1) Benefits may be continued under this section only if the determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling is made on or after January 12, 1983 (or before January 12, 1983, and a timely request for reconsideration or a hearing before an administrative law judge is pending on that date).

(2) Benefits may be continued under this section only for months beginning with January 1983, or the first month for which benefits are no longer otherwise payable following our determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling, whichever is later.

(3) Continued payment of benefits under this section will stop effective with the earlier of:

(i) The month before the month in which an administrative law judge's hearing decision finds that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling or the month before the month of a new administrative law judge decision (or final action by the Appeals Council on the administrative law judge's recommended decision) if your case was sent back to an administrative law judge for further action; or

(ii) The month before the month no timely request for a reconsideration or a hearing before an administrative law judge is pending. These continued benefits may be stopped or adjusted because of certain events (such as work and earnings or receipt of worker's compensation) which occur while you are receiving these continued benefits and affect your right to receive continued benefits.
