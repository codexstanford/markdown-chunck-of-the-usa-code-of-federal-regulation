## Chapter II - Railroad Retirement Board
### Subchapter C - Regulations Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act
#### PART 330 - DETERMINATION OF DAILY BENEFIT RATES
##### ยง 330.5 Procedure for obtaining and using information about daily rate of compensation.
###### Information furnished by employers.

(a)Every employer, as defined in part 301 of this chapter, shall furnish information to the Board with respect to the daily rate of compensation of each employee for his or her last employment in the applicable base year. The employer shall make such report when it files its annual report of compensation in accordance with part 209 of this chapter and shall use the form prescribed by the Board for that purpose. If an employee's last daily rate of compensation in the base year is $99.99 or more, the employer may report such rate as $99.99 instead of the employee's actual last daily rate of compensation. In the absence of evidence to the contrary or a challenge by the employee, the daily rate of compensation provided by an employer under this section shall be used to compute a qualified employee's daily benefit rate. If an employer fails to report the last daily rate of compensation for a qualified employee who has applied for benefits or if an employee challenges the daily rate reported by an employer, the procedure in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will apply.
