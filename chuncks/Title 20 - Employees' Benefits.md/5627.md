(i) To do a work-related task, you must be able to understandrememberapply information required by the task. Similarly, you must be able to concentratepersistmaintain pace in order to complete the task, and adaptmanage yourself in the workplace. Limitation in any one of these parts (understandrememberapply; concentratepersistmaintain pace; adaptmanage oneself) may prevent you from completing a work-related task.

(ii) We will document the rating of limitation of the whole area of mental functioning, not each individual part. We will not add ratings of the parts together. For example, with respect to paragraph B3, if you have marked limitation in maintaining pace, and mild or moderate limitations in concentrating and persisting, we will find that you have marked limitation in the whole paragraph B3 area of mental functioning.

(iii) Marked limitation in more than one part of the same paragraph B area of mental functioning does not satisfy the requirement to have marked limitation in two paragraph B areas of mental functioning.
