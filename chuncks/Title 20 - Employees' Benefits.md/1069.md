####### Entitlement based on "child in care."

(c)When the surviving divorced spouse annuity is based on having a "child in care" as explained in part 216 of this chapter, the annuity ends as shown in this paragraph unless he or she is at least age 60 and was married to the employee for at least 10 years. In that case, the surviving divorced spouse annuity based on having a child in care is changed to an annuity based on age. If the surviving divorced spouse is not entitled to an annuity based on age, the surviving divorced spouse annuity based on "child in care" ends with the earliest of-

(1) The last day of the month shown in paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) The last day of the month before the month in which the child is no longer in the surviving divorced spouse's care, as explained in part 216 of this chapter (in this case entitlement to the annuity does not terminate, but no annuity is payable while the child is no longer in care);

(3) The last day of the month before the month in which the child attains age 16, unless the child is disabled;

(4) The last day of the month before the month in which the surviving divorced spouse remarries unless the marriage is to an individual entitled to a retirement, disability, widow(er)'s, father's/mother's, parent's or child's disability benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act;

(5) The last day of the second month after the month in which the child's disability ends, if the child is over age 16; or

(6) The last day of the month before the month in which the surviving divorced spouse attains full retirement age (the annuitant then becomes entitled to an annuity based upon age).
