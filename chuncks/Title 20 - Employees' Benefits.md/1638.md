###### ยง 225.50 General.

After an annuitant begins receiving an annuity, the PIA's may be recomputed as explained in ยง 225.52. Most recomputations result in an increase in the PIA. The Board pays a recomputed PIA when an increase of at least $1 results. Most recomputations are processed automatically and require no action by the annuitant.
