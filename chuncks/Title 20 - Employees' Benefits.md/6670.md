###### ยง 404.1641 Standards of performance.
####### General.

(a)The performance standards include both a target level of performance and a threshold level of performance for the State agency. The target level represents a level of performance that we and the States will work to attain in the future. The threshold level is the minimum acceptable level of performance. Performance below the threshold level will be the basis for the Commissioner's taking from the State agency partial or complete responsibility for performing the disability determination function. Intermediate State agency goals are designed to help each State agency move from its current performance levels to the target levels.
