####### General.

(a)During a temporary absence, we continue to consider the absent person a member of the household. A temporary absence occurs when-

(1) You, your ineligible spouse, parent, or an ineligible child leaves the household but intends to and does return in the same month or the month immediately following; or

(2) You enter a medical treatment facility and are eligible for either benefit payable under ยง 416.212. We consider your absence to be temporary through the last month benefits under ยง 416.212 were paid unless you were discharged from the facility in the following month. In that case, we consider your absence to be temporary through the date of discharge.
