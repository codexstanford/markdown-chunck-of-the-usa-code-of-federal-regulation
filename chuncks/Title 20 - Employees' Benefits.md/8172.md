(3)For the purpose of determining SGA, a payment you make toward the cost of a deductible item (regardless of when it is acquired) may be deducted if payment is made in a month you are working. For the purpose of determining your SSI monthly payment amount, a payment you make toward the cost of a deductible item (regardless of when it is acquired) may be deducted if the payment is made in the month your earned income is received and the earned income is for work done in the month you used the item. If you begin working and make a payment before the month earned income is received, the payment is also deductible. If you make a payment after you stop working, and the payment is made in the month you received earned income for work done in the month you used the item, the payment is also deductible. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section when purchases are made in anticipation of work.
