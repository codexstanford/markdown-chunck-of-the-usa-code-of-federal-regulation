###### ยง 416.1471 Dismissal by Appeals Council.

The Appeals Council will dismiss your request for review if you did not file your request within the stated period of time and the time for filing has not been extended. The Appeals Council may also dismiss any proceedings before it if-

(a) You and any other party to the proceedings files a written request for dismissal; or

(b) You die, there are no other parties, and we have no information to show that you may have a survivor who may be paid benefits due to you under ยง 416.542(b) and who wishes to pursue the request for review, or that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act. The Appeals Council, however, will vacate a dismissal of the request for review if, within 60 days after the date of the dismissal:

(1) A person claiming to be your survivor, who may be paid benefits due to you under ยง 416.542(b), submits a written request for review, and shows that a decision on the issues that were to be considered on review may adversely affect him or her; or

(2) We receive information showing that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act.
