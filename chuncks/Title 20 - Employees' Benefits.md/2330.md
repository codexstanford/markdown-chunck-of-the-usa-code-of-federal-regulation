##### Subpart A - Normal Benefits
###### ยง 336.4 Base year compensation.
####### Formula.

(a)For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include any amount that exceeds the value of "X" in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600). In this formula, "A" is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation base with respect to months in such base year. For example, if an employee had railroad earnings of $1,500 per month in each of three months in base year 1990, the employee's base year compensation for purposes of part 302 of this chapter would be $2,235 (three times the monthly compensation base of $745 per month for months in 1990). But the employee's base year compensation for purposes of computing maximum normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits under this subpart would be $2,886 (three times $962), and his or her normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits would not be considered exhausted until he or she is paid unemployment (or sickness) benefits in an amount equal to $2,886. In this example, $962 is the amount computed as the value of "X" in the above formula when "A" is equal to $745.
