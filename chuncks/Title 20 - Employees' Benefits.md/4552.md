###### ยง 404.1350 Deemed insured status.
####### Amount of credit given for deemed insured World War II veterans.

(b)(1) When we compute a survivor's benefit or lump-sum death payment, we give credit for-

(i) $200 (for increment year purposes) for each calendar year in which the veteran had at least 30 days of active service beginning September 16, 1940, through 1950; and

(ii) An average monthly wage of $160.

(2) If the World War II veteran was fully or currently insured without the wage credits, we add increment years (years after 1936 and prior to 1951 in which the veteran had at least $200 in creditable earnings) to the increment years based on the veteran's wages.
