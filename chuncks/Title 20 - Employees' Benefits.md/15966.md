######## Adjustment by withholding part of a monthly benefit.

(c)Adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section may be effected by withholding a part of the monthly benefit payable to a beneficiary where it is determined that:

(1) Withholding the full amount each month would deprive the beneficiary of income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses;

(2) The overpayment was not caused by the beneficiary's intentionally false statement or representation, or willful concealment of, or deliberate failure to furnish, material information; and

(3) Recoupment can be effected in an amount of not less than $ 10 a month and at a rate which would not unreasonably extend the period of adjustment.
