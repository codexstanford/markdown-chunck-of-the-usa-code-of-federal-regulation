####### What is a psychological consultant?

(c)A psychological consultant is a member of a team that makes disability determinations in a State agency (see ยง 416.1015), or who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations for us when we make disability determinations ourselves. The psychological consultant completes the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment about all mental impairment(s) in a claim. When we are unable to obtain the services of a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist despite making every reasonable effort (see ยง 416.1017) in a claim involving a mental impairment(s), a medical consultant will evaluate the mental impairment(s).
