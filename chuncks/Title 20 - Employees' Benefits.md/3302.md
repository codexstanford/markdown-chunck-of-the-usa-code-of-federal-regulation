###### ยง 404.313 What are delayed retirement credits and how do they increase my old-age benefit amount?
####### How do delayed retirement credits affect the special minimum primary insurance amount?,i.e.

(d)We do not add delayed retirement credits to your old-age benefit if your benefit is based on the special minimum primary insurance amount described in ยง 404.260. We add the delayed retirement credits only to your old-age benefit based on your regular primary insurance amount,as computed under one of the other provisions of subpart C of this part. If your benefit based on the regular primary insurance amount plus your delayed retirement credits is higher than the benefit based on your special minimum primary insurance amount, we will pay the higher amount to you. However, if the special minimum primary insurance amount is higher than the regular primary insurance amount without the delayed retirement credits, we will use the special minimum primary insurance amount to determine the family maximum and the benefits of others entitled on your earnings record.
