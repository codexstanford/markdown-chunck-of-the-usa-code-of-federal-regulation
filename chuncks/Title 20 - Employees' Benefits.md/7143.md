###### ยง 408.923 Is there a limit on the amount we will withhold from your SVB payments to recover an overpayment?
####### Your right to request a different rate of withholding.

(b)When we notify you of the rate we propose to withhold from your monthly SVB payment, we will give you the opportunity to request a higher or lower rate of withholding than that proposed. If you request a rate of withholding that is lower than the one established under paragraph (a) of this section, we will set a rate that is appropriate to your financial condition after we evaluate all the pertinent facts. An appropriate rate is one that will not deprive you of income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses. We will evaluate your income, resources, and expenses as described in ยง 404.508 of this chapter.
