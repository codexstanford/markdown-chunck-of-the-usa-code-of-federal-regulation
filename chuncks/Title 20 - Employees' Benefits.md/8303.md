(2) Waiver of recovery of an overpayment resulting from continued benefits to you may be considered as long as the cessation determination was appealed in good faith. We will assume that your appeal was made in good faith and, therefore, you have the right to waiver considerationyou fail to cooperate in connection with the appeal, e.g., if you fail (without good reason) to give us medical or other evidence we request, or to go for a physical or mental examination when requested, in connection with the appeal. In determining whether you have good cause for failure to cooperate and, thus, whether an appeal was made in good faith, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) you may have which may have caused your failure to cooperate.
