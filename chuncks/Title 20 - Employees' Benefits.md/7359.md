##### ยง 411.505 How is an EN paid?

An EN (including a State VR agency acting as an EN) can elect to be paid under either the outcome payment system or the outcome-milestone payment system. The EN will elect a payment system at the time the EN enters into an agreement with us. (For State VR agencies, see ยง 411.365.) The EN (or State VR agency) may periodically change its elected EN payment system as described in ยง 411.515.
