###### ยง 404.1918 How benefits are computed.
####### Auxiliary and survivors benefits; reductions; family maximum.

(f)We will determine auxiliary and survivors benefit amounts (see subpart D) on the basis of the pro rata PIA. We will apply the regular reductions for age under section 202(q) of the Act to the benefits of the worker or to any auxiliaries or survivors which are based on the pro rata PIA (see ยง 404.410). Benefits will be payable subject to the family maximum (see ยง 404.403) derived from the pro rata PIA. If the pro rata PIA is less than the minimum PIA, the family maximum will be 1times the pro rata PIA.
