###### § 416.999c How do we determine provisional benefits?
####### Examples:

(4)

(c) We will not pay you a provisional benefit for a month where you are not eligible for a payment under §§ 416.1322, 416.1323, 416.1325, 416.1327, 416.1329, 416.1330, 416.1334, and 416.1339.

(d) We will not pay you a provisional benefit for any month that is after the earliest of either: the month we send you notice of our determination on your request for reinstatement; or, the sixth month following the month you requested expedited reinstatement.

(e) You are not eligible for provisional benefits if-

(1) Prior to starting your provisional benefits we determine that you do not meet the requirements for reinstatement under §§ 416.999a(a); or

(2) We determine that your statements on your request for reinstatement, made under § 416.999b(d)(2), are false.

(f) Determinations we make regarding your provisional benefits under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are final and are not subject to administrative and judicial review under subpart N of part 416.

(g) If you were previously overpaid benefits under title II or title XVI of the Act, we will not recover the overpayment from your provisional benefits unless you give us permission.

(h) If we determine you are not eligible to receive reinstated benefits, provisional benefits we have already paid you under this section that were made prior to the termination month under paragraph (d) of this section will not be subject to recovery as an overpayment unless we determine that you knew, or should have known, you did not meet the requirements for reinstatement in § 416.999a. If we inadvertently pay you provisional benefits when you are not entitled to them because we have already made a determination described in paragraph (e) of this section, they will be subject to recover as an overpayment under subpart E of part 416.
