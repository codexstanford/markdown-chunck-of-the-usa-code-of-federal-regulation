####### Working on employer's premises.

(9)Working on the employer's premises may indicate that an individual is an employee where by nature the work could be done elsewhere, because the employer's place of business is physically within the employer's direction and supervision. Desk space, telephone, and stenographic services provided by an employer place the worker within the employer's direction and supervision unless the worker has the option not to use these facilities. Work done off the employer's premises does not by itself indicate that the worker is not an employee because some occupations require that work be performed away from the premises of the employer. Control over the place of work is indicated when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to compel the worker to travel a designated route, to canvass a territory within a certain time, or to work at specific places as required.
