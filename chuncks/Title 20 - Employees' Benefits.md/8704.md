##### ยง 416.1233 Exclusion of certain underpayments from resources.
###### Limitation on exclusion.

(c)This exclusion applies only to any unspent portion of retroactive payments made under title II or XVI. Once the money from the retroactive payment is spent, this exclusion does not apply to items purchased with the money, even if the 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable (see paragraph (a) of this section), has not expired. However, other exclusions may be applicable. As long as the funds from the retroactive payment are not spent, they are excluded for the full 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable.
