###### § 404.1590 When and how often we will conduct a continuing disability review.
####### Reviews to determine whether the work you have done shows that you are able to do substantial gainful activity.

(4)Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to reviews we conduct using the rules in §§ 404.1571-404.1576 to determine whether the work you have done shows that you are able to do substantial gainful activity and are, therefore, no longer disabled.
