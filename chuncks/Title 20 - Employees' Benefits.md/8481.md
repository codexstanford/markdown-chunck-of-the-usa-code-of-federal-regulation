###### ยง 416.1133 What is a pro rata share of household operating expenses.
####### General.

(a)If you pay your pro rata share toward monthly household operating expenses, you are living in your own household and are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance from anyone else in the household. The one-third reduction, therefore, does not apply to you. (If you are receiving food or shelter from someone outside the household, we value it under the rule in ยง 416.1140.)
