###### Needs-based stipend.

The term "Needs-based stipends" means additional payments (beyond regular stipends for program participation) that are based on defined needs that enable youth to participate in the program. To provide needs-based stipends the grantee must have a written policy in place, which defines: Eligibility; the amounts; and the required documentation and criteria for payments. This policy must be applied consistently to all program participants.
