#### PART 348 - REPRESENTATIVE PAYMENT
##### ยง 348.1 Introduction.
###### Explanation of representative payment.

(a)This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee may be either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of a claimant will be served by representative payment rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines that the claimant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.
