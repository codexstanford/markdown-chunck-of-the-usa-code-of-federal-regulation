###### ยง 418.3625 What is the process for administrative review?

The process for administrative review of initial determinations is either a hearing conducted by telephone or a case review. We will provide you with a hearing by telephone when you appeal the initial determination made on your claim, unless you choose not to participate in a telephone hearing. If you choose not to participate in a telephone hearing, the review will consist of a case review. The hearing will be conducted by an individual who was not involved in making the initial determination. The individual who conducts the hearing will make the final decision after the hearing. If you are dissatisfied after we have made a final decision, you may file an action in Federal district court.
