###### ยง 229.66 Changes in reduction amount.
####### Change in DIB O/M.

(a)The amount of the worker's compensation or public disability benefit reduction does not change when there is an increase in the DIB O/M rate because of an amendment or cost of living increase. However, the reduction amount does change if there is a change in the family members included in the DIB O/M. When the number of family members changes and the DIB O/M is still payable, the amount of the reduction is recomputed using the DIB O/M rate, including the changed family group, as if the new family composition had existed when the worker's compensation or public disability benefit reduction first applied. However, this new reduction is not effective until the date of the change of the family group. The worker's compensation or public disability benefit and average current earnings are the same as those used before the change in the family group.
