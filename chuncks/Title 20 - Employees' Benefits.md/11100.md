##### ยง 618.510 Eligibility period for payments of Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance and application deadline.
###### Adversely affected worker who has not received TRA.

(a)(1) In the case of an AAW who has not received TRA, the worker may receive benefits as described in ยง 618.520(a) for a period not to exceed 104 weeks beginning on the earlier of:

(i) The date on which the worker exhausts all rights to UI based on the separation of the worker from the adversely affected employment that is the basis of the certification; or

(ii) The date on which the worker first begins qualifying reemployment as described in ยง 618.505(e).

(2) Where a worker has more than one separation from adversely affected employment, the relevant separation for determining the date on which the "worker exhausts all rights to UI" referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is the worker's last separation from adversely affected employment that qualifies the worker as an AAW. The Department uses the last separation because that separation is the one that triggers the worker's application for RTAA. Accordingly, the State must determine the worker's last separation for lack of work from adversely affected employment before the RTAA application. This principle applies only to the determination of the eligibility period and does not apply to the calculation of RTAA payments, where wages at separation are defined as the annualized hourly rate at the time of the most recent separation, as explained in ยง 618.520(a).
