####### Claim is for life benefits.

(a)An application for life benefits under title II of the Social Security Act is an application for an annuity if the conditions either in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) or in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are met:

(1) The application was filed because the applicant did not know he or she was eligible for an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. The Board must have or receive evidence indicating why the applicant thought that he or she lacked eligibility for an annuity.

(2) The claimant would have been entitled to and would currently be entitled to an annuity under subpart B or D of part 216 of this chapter if the applicant had applied for the annuity on the date the social security application was filed.

(3) The applicant asks the Board in a written statement to consider the application for social security benefits as an application for an employee or spouse annuity.

(4) The application was filed because the employee had less than 10 years of creditable railroad service, and having established entitlement to social security benefits and continued working in railroad service, subsequently acquired 10 years of railroad service.
