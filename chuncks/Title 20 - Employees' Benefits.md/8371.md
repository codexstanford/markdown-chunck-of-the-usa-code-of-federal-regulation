(a) We will provide the State agency with written guidelines necessary for it to carry out its responsibilities in performing the disability determination function.

(b) The State agency making determinations of disability will comply with our written guidelines that are not designated as advisory or discretionary. (See ยง 416.1002 for what we mean by written guidelines.)

(c) A representative group of State agencies will be given an opportunity to participate in formulating disability program policies that have an effect on their role in carrying out the disability determination function. State agencies will also be given an opportunity to comment before changes are made in written guidelines unless delay in issuing a change may impair service to the public.
