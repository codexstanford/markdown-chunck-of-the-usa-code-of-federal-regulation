(3)If both you and a person entitled (or deemed entitled) on your earnings record have excess earnings (as described in ยง 404.430), your excess earnings are charged first against the total family benefits payable (or deemed payable) on your earnings record, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

See ยง 404.441 for an example of this process and the manner in which partial monthly benefits are apportioned.
