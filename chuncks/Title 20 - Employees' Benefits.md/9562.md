###### ยง 418.3420 How are funds held in financial institution accounts counted?
####### Jointly-held account.

(c)(1) If you are the only subsidy claimant or subsidy recipient who is an account holder on a jointly held account, we presume that all of the funds in the account belong to you. If more than one subsidy claimant or subsidy recipient are account holders, we presume that the funds in the account belong to those individuals in equal shares.

(2) If you disagree with the ownership presumption as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you may rebut the presumption. Rebuttal is a procedure which permits you to furnish evidence and establish that some or all of the funds in a jointly-held account do not belong to you.
