#### Subpart H - Labor Condition Applications and Requirements for Employers Seeking To Employ Nonimmigrants on H-1b Visas in Specialty Occupations and as Fashion Models, and Requirements for Employers Seeking To Employ Nonimmigrants on H-1b1 and E-3 Visas in Specialty Occupations
##### § 655.715 Definitions.
###### i.e.,

(C) The H-1B nonimmigrant is not at the location as a "strikebreaker" (the H-1B nonimmigrant is not performing work in an occupation in which workers are on strike or lockout).

(2) Examples of "non-worksite" locations based on worker's job functions: A computer engineer sent out to customer locations to "troubleshoot" complaints regarding software malfunctions; a sales representative making calls on prospective customers or established customers within a "home office" sales territory; a manager monitoring the performance of out-stationed employees; an auditor providing advice or conducting reviews at customer facilities; a physical therapist providing services to patients in their homes within an area of employment; an individual making a court appearance; an individual lunching with a customer representative at a restaurant; or an individual conducting research at a library.

(3) Examples of "worksite" locations based on worker's job functions: A computer engineer who works on projects or accounts at different locations for weeks or months at a time; a sales representative assigned on a continuing basis in an area away from his/her "home office;" an auditor who works for extended periods at the customer's offices; a physical therapist who "fills in" for full-time employees of health care facilities for extended periods; or a physical therapist who works for a contractor whose business is to provide staffing on an "as needed" basis at hospitals, nursing homes, or clinics.

(4) Whenever an H-1B worker performs work at a location which is not a "worksite" (under the criterion in paragraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this definition), that worker's "place of employment" or "worksite" for purposes of H-1B obligations is the worker's home station or regular work location. The employer's obligations regarding notice, prevailing wage and working conditions are focused on the home station "place of employment" rather than on the above-described location(s) which do not constitute worksite(s) for these purposes. However, whether or not a location is considered to be a "worksite"/"place of employment" for an H-1B nonimmigrant, the employer is required to provide reimbursement to the H-1B nonimmigrant for expenses incurred in traveling to that location on the employer's business, since such expenses are considered to be ordinary business expenses of employers (§§ 655.731(c)(7)(iii)(C); 655.731(c)(9)). In determining the worker's "place of employment" or "worksite," the Department will look carefully at situations which appear to be contrived or abusive; the Department would seriously question any situation where the H-1B nonimmigrant's purported "place of employment" is a location other than where the worker spends most of his/her work time, or where the purported "area of employment" does not include the location(s) where the worker spends most of his/her work time.
