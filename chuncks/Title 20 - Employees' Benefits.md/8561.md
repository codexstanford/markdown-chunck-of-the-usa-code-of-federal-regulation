###### ยง 416.1163 How we deem income to you from your ineligible spouse.
####### Ineligible spouse dies.

(4)If your ineligible spouse dies, we do not deem your spouse's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the month following the month of death. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the month following the month of death, we use only your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible spouse.
