###### § 702.410 Duties of employees with respect to special examinations.

(a) For any special examination required of an employee by §§ 702.408 and 702.409, the employee shall submit to such examination at such place as is designated in the order to report, but the place so selected shall be reasonably convenient for the employee.

(b) Where an employee fails to submit to an examination required by §§ 702.408 and 702.409, the district director or administrative law judge may order that no compensation otherwise payable shall be paid for any period during which the employee refuses to submit to such examination unless circumstances justified the refusal.

(c) Where an employee unreasonably refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment, or to an examination by a physician selected by the employer, the district director or administrative law judge may by order suspend the payment of further compensation during such time as the refusal continues. Except that refusal to submit to medical treatment because of adherence to the tenets of a recognized church or religious denomination as described in § 702.401(b) shall not cause the suspension of compensation.
