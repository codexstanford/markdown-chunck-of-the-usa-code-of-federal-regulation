###### Payments to residents to Medicaid facilities.

(d)A Medicaid facility is a medical care facility where Medicaid pays more than 50 percent of the cost of a person's care. In order to be eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement, any State that has a supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities on or after October 1, 1987, must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner to maintain such supplementary payment level at least equal to the October 1987 level (or if a State first makes such supplementary payments after October 1, 1987, but before July 1, 1988, the level for the first month the State makes such supplementary payments).
