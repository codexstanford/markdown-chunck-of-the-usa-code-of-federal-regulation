######## Basic rate.

(a)The amount of benefits payable to a beneficiary for a month is determined, in the first instance, by computing the "basic rate." The basic rate is equal to 37percent of the monthly pay rate for Federal employees in GS-2, step 1. That rate for a month is determined by:

(1) Ascertaining the lowest annual rate of pay (step 1) for Grade GS-2 of the General Schedule applicable to such month (see 5 U.S.C. 5332);

(2) Ascertaining the monthly rate thereof by dividing the amount determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 12; and

(3) Ascertaining the basic rate under the Act by multiplying the amount determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 0.375 (that is, by 37percent).
