2.04To confirm the condition of pulmonary hypertension, the Tables under Body Part C., Cardiac, designate as "highly recommended": an electrocardiogram which indicates definite right ventricular hypertrophy. However, the impairment may also be confirmed by insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter into the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary artery pressure measured directly.

2.05 There may be some conditions for which several "highly recommended" tests are suggested to confirm an impairment. In these circumstances, we will use all "highly recommended" tests to establish the existence of the impairment.
