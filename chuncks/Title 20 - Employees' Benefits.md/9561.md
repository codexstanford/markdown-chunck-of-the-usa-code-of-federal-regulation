####### Individually-held account.

(b)If you are designated as the sole owner by the account title and you can withdraw and use funds from that account for your support and maintenance, all of that account's funds are your resource regardless of the source. For as long as these conditions are met, we presume that you own 100 percent of the funds in the account. This presumption is not rebuttable.
