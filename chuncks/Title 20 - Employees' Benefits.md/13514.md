###### Prevailing piece rate

means that amount that is typically paid to an agricultural worker per piece (which includes, but is not limited to, a load, bin, pallet, bag, bushel, etc.), to be determined by the SWA according to a methodology published by the Department. As is currently the case, the unit of production will be required to be clearly described; e.g., a field box of oranges (1bushels), a bushel of potatoes, and Eastern apple box (1metric bushels), a flat of strawberries (twelve quarts), etc.
