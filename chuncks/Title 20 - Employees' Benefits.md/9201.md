(d)The agreement may be modified at any time by mutual consent. The State or SSA may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice to the other party, provided the effective date of the termination is the last day of a quarter. However, the State may terminate the agreement upon 45 days written notice to SSA where: (1) The State does not wish to comply with a regulation promulgated by SSA subsequent to the execution of the agreement; and (2) the State provides such written notice within 30 days of the effective date of the regulation. The Secretary is not precluded from terminating the agreement in less than 90 days where he finds that a State has failed to materially comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section or ยง 416.2090.
