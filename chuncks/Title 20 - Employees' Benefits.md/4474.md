(b)We notify the State that if it desires coverage, it may be provided by either a regular modification or an error modification, depending on the circumstances (§§ 404.1215 and 404.1216). In most cases, the State may obtain coverage by a regular modification. If a regular modification cannot be used (e.g., State law does not permit the retroactive effective date which would be desired), the State may use an error modification. The effective date of either modification depends on the facts of the situation being corrected.
