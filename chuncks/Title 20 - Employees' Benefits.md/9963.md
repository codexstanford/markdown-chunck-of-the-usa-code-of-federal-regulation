###### Policy.

(c)SSA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain incident to employment. We encourage employees to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid losses that may not be recoverable from SSA. The procedures set forth in this subpart are designed to enable you to obtain the proper amount of compensation from SSA and/or a private insurer for the loss or damage. If you fail to comply with these procedures it could reduce or preclude payment of your claim under this subpart.
