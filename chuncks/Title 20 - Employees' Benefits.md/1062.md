However, see also paragraph (d) of this section. If the widow(er) is eligible for a widow(er) annuity based on age, when he or she is no longer entitled on the basis of having a "child in care," his or her annuity is changed to a widow(er) annuity based on age.

(1) The last day of the month shown in paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) The last day of the month before the month in which the child is no longer in the widow(er)'s care as explained in part 216 of this chapter (in this case entitlement to the annuity does not terminate, but no annuity is payable while the child is no longer in care);

(3) The last day of the month before the month in which the child attains age 18 and is not disabled;

(4) The last day of the month before the month in which the widow(er) attains full retirement age (the "child in care" annuity is changed to an age annuity);

(5) The last day of the month before the month in which the child marries;

(6) The last day of the month before the month in which the child dies; or

(7) The last day of the second month after the month in which the child's disability ends, if the child is over age 18.
