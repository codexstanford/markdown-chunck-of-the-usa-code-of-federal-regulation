###### General.

(a)In preparing a report required under this part, an employer may report compensation in the report required for the year in which the compensation was paid even though such compensation was earned by the employee in a previous year. If compensation is reported with respect to the year in which it was paid, it shall be credited by the Board to the employee in such year unless within the four year period provided in ยง 211.15 of this chapter the employee requests that such compensation be credited to the year in which it was earned. If the employee makes such a request, and the Board determines that the compensation should be credited to the year in which it was earned, the reporting employer must file an adjustment report as required by ยง 209.9 of this part which reports such compensation in the year in which it was earned. The employee may revoke his or her request anytime prior to the filing of the adjustment report. Upon the Board's receipt of the adjustment report, the request becomes irrevocable.
