##### ยง 327.10 Consideration of availability.
###### Attendance in school or training course.

(e)(1) A claimant who has voluntarily left work to enroll as a student in an educational institution shall be presumed not to be available for work. For the purpose of this provision, leaving work is considered voluntary when the claimant on his or her own initiative left work that he or she could have continued to perform but for the claimant's decision to attend school. In all other cases, this presumption shall not apply, but eligibility shall instead be determined on the basis of the facts of each case. In each such case, the claimant shall be given an opportunity to establish that he or she remains ready and willing to engage in full-time employment for hire, notwithstanding his or her school attendance. If a claimant is enrolled in a vocational training program at a trade or technical school, he or she shall be considered available for work if his or her current prospects for work are poor and the vocational training can reasonably be expected to increase his or her prospects for obtaining new employment.
