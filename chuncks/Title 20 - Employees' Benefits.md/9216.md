###### Effect of additional income exclusions on payment amounts.

(c)A State has the option of excluding amounts of earned and unearned income in addition to the amounts it is required to exclude under paragraph (a) of this section in determining a person's eligibility for State supplementary payments. Such additional income exclusions affect the amount of the State supplementary payments as follows:

(1) Countable income (as determined under the Federal eligibility rules) will first be deducted from the Federal benefit rate applicable to an eligible individual or eligible couple.

(2) Such countable income is then reduced by the amount of the additional income exclusion specified by the State.

(3) If the remaining countable income is equal to or less than the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the full amount of the State supplementary payment will be made.

(4) If the remaining countable income exceeds the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the State supplementary payment will be reduced by the amount of such excess.
