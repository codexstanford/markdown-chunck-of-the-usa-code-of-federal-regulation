###### ยง 225.53 Recomputation to consider additional earnings.
####### Earnings not reported in time to use them in the computation of the PIA.

(3)Because of the way reports of earnings are made, the earnings an employee has in the year before he or she becomes entitled to an annuity, becomes disabled, or dies, might not be reported in time to use them in computing the PIA. The Board recomputes the PIA with the new earnings information and begins paying annuitants the higher benefits based on the additional earnings at the time described in paragraph (b) of this section.
