##### ยง 655.736 What are H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators?
###### How is an employer's H-1B-dependency status to be shown on the LCA?,i.e.,

(e)The employer is required to designate its status by marking the appropriate box on the Form ETA-9035 or 9035E (either H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent). An employer which marks the designation of "H-1B-dependent" may also mark the designation of its intention to seek only "exempt" H-1B nonimmigrants on the LCA (see paragraph (g) of this section, and ยง 655.737). In the event that an employer has filed an LCA designating its H-1B-dependency status (either H-1B-dependent or non-H-1B-dependent) and thereafter experiences a change of status, the employer cannot use that LCA to support H-1B petitions for new nonimmigrants or requests for extension of H-1B status for existing nonimmigrants. Similarly, an employer that is or becomes H-1B-dependent cannot continue to use an LCA filed before January 19, 2001 to support new H-1B petitions or requests for extension of status. In such circumstances, the employer shall file a new LCA accurately designating its status and shall use that new LCA to support new petitions or requests for extensions of status.
