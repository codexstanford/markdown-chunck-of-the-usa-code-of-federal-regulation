The Railroad Retirement Act provides two types of disability annuities for employees who have been credited with at least 10 years of railroad service. An employee may receive an annuity if his or her disability prevents work in his or her regular railroad occupation. An employee who cannot be considered for a disability based on ability to work in his or her regular railroad occupation may receive an annuity if his or her disability prevents work in any regular employment.
