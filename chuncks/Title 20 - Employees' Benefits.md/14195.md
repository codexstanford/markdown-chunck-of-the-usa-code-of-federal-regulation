(2) These procedures must provide an opportunity for a hearing and prescribe appropriate time limits to ensure prompt resolution of the appeal.

(4) If the Secretary determines that the appellant was not accorded procedural rights under the appeal process established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or that the area meets the requirements for designation at WIA section 116(a)(2) or 116(a)(3), the Secretary may require that the area be designated as a workforce investment area.
