####### Entitlement based on "child in care."

(c)When the remarried widow(er) annuity is based on having a "child in care," as explained in part 216 of this chapter, the annuity ends as shown in this paragraph unless the remarried widow(er) is at least age 60. In that case, the remarried widow(er) annuity based on having a "child in care" is changed to an annuity based on age. If the remarried widow(er) is not entitled to an annuity based on age, the remarried widow(er) annuity based on having a "child in care" ends with the earliest of-

(1) The last day of the month shown in paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) The last day of the month before the month in which the child is no longer in the remarried widow(er)'s care, as explained in part 216 of this chapter (in this case entitlement to the annuity does not terminate but no annuity is payable while the child is no longer in care);

(3) The last day of the month before the month in which the child attains age 16, unless the child is disabled;

(4) The last day of the month before the month in which the remarried widow(er) remarries unless the marriage is to an individual entitled to a retirement, disability, widow(er)'s, father's/mother's, parent's or child's disability benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act;

(5) The last day of the second month after the month in which the child's disability ends, if the child is over age 16; or

(6) The last day of the month before the month in which the remarried widow attains full retirement age (the annuitant then becomes entitled to an annuity based upon age).
