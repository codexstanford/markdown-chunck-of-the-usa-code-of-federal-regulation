##### In-Kind Support and Maintenance in Special Circumstances
###### § 416.1148 If you have both in-kind support and maintenance and income that is deemed to you.
####### The one-third reduction and deeming of income.

(a)If you live in the household of your spouse, parent, essential person, or sponsor whose income can be deemed to you, or the household of a parent whose income is not deemed to you because of the provisions of § 416.1165(i), the one-third reduction does not apply to you. The rules on deeming income are in §§ 416.1160 through 416.1169. However, if you live in another person's household as described in § 416.1131, and someone whose income can be deemed to you lives in the same household, we must apply both the one-third reduction and the deeming rules to you.
