##### ยง 404.410 How does SSA reduce my benefits when my entitlement begins before full retirement age?
###### Widow's or widower's benefits based on age.

(1)Your widow's or widower's unreduced benefit amount (the worker's primary insurance amount after any reduction for the family maximum under ยง 404.403), is reduced or further reduced based on the number of months of entitlement prior to the month you attain full retirement age. This does not include any month in which you have in your care a child of the worker on whose earnings record you are entitled. The child must be entitled to child's benefits. The number of months of entitlement prior to full retirement age is multiplied by .285 and then divided by the number of months in the period beginning with the month of attainment of age 60 and ending with the month immediately before the month of attainment of full retirement age.
