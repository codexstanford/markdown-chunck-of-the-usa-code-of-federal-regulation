####### How we credit QCs based on earnings after 1977 (General).

(c)After 1977, both wages and self-employment income are generally reported on an annual basis. For calendar years after 1977, as explained in ยง 404.143, we generally credit you with a QC for each part of your total covered earnings in a calendar year that equals the amount required for a QC in that year. Section 404.143 also tells how the amount required for a QC will be increased in the future as average wages increase. Section 404.144 tells how self-employment income derived in a taxable year beginning after 1977 is credited to specific calendar years for purposes of ยง 404.143.
