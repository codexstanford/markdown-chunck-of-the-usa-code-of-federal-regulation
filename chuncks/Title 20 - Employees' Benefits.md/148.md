####### ยง 10.423 May compensation payments be assigned to, or attached by, creditors?

(a) As a general rule, compensation and claims for compensation are exempt from the claims of private creditors. Further, any attempt by a FECA beneficiary to assign his or her claim is null and void. However, pursuant to provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 659, and regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at 5 CFR part 581, FECA benefits, including survivor's benefits, may be garnished to collect overdue alimony and child support payments.

(b) Garnishment for child support and alimony may be requested by providing a copy of the State agency or court order to the district office handling the FECA claim.
