###### How will we evaluate symptomatic congenital heart disease?

2.

a. Because of improved treatment methods, more children with congenital heart disease are living longer. Although some types of congenital heart disease may be corrected by surgery, many children with treated congenital heart disease continue to have problems throughout their lives (symptomatic congenital heart disease). If you have congenital heart disease that results in chronic heart failure with evidence of ventricular dysfunction or in recurrent arrhythmias, we will evaluate your impairment under 104.02 or 104.05. Otherwise, we will evaluate your impairment under 104.06.

b. For 104.06A2, we will accept pulse oximetry measurements instead of arterial O, but the arterial Ovalues are preferred, if available.

c. For 104.06D, examples of impairments that in most instances will require life-saving surgery or a combination of surgery and other major interventional procedures (for example, multiple "balloon" catheter procedures) before age 1 include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,

(ii) Critical aortic stenosis with neonatal heart failure,

(iii) Critical coarctation of the aorta, with or without associated anomalies,

(iv) Complete atrioventricular canal defects,

(v) Transposition of the great arteries,

(vi) Tetralogy of Fallot,

(vii) Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum,

(viii) Single ventricle,

(ix) Tricuspid atresia, and

(x) Multiple ventricular septal defects.
