###### Unusual circumstances.

(1)Whenever the RRB cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of "unusual circumstances," as defined in the FOIA, and the RRB extends the time limit on that basis, the RRB shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the RRB estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the RRB shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The RRB shall make available its designated FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The RRB shall also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.
