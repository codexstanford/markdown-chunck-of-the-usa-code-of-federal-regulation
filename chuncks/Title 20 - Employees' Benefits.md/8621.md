###### Liquid resources.

(b)Liquid resources are cash or other property which can be converted to cash within 20 days, excluding certain nonwork days as explained in ยง 416.120(d). Examples of resources that are ordinarily liquid are stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, promissory notes, mortgages, life insurance policies, financial institution accounts (including savings, checking, and time deposits, also known as certificates of deposit) and similar items. Liquid resources, other than cash, are evaluated according to the individual's equity in the resources. (See ยง 416.1208 for the treatment of funds held in individual and joint financial institution accounts.)
