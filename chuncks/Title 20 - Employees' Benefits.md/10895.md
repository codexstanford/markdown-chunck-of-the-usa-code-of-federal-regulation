###### Termination of investigation.

(e)(1) The Department will notify the petitioner of the termination of an investigation, publish a Notice of Termination of Investigation in theand post on the Department's website. The Department may terminate an investigation if the investigation establishes one of the following:

(i) The petition is invalid, which includes petitions identifying a nonexistent group of workers, filed under false pretenses, or perpetuating fraud;

(ii) The petitioner has withdrawn the petition in writing;

(iii) The group of workers identified in the investigation is the same as a group of workers identified in another pending investigation;

(iv) The group of workers identified in the investigation already has been issued a denial, and the period of investigation applicable to the current investigation and the previous denial is the same; or

(v) The group of workers identified in the investigation is already covered by a certification that does not expire within 90 calendar days of the determination.

(2) If appropriate to protect the interests of the group of workers covered by a petition filed and terminated under paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Department may use the original impact date of the terminated petition for the identical group of workers covered under a later, valid, petition covering the identical group of workers, provided that it is filed within 30 calendar days of the filing date of the first petition. Under no circumstances will the Department use the impact date of an earlier petition when that petition was terminated for being invalid under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section because it was filed under false pretenses or to perpetuate a fraud.

(3) Section 618.245 describes reconsideration of a termination of investigation.
