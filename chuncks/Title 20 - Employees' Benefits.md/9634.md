##### ยง 422.114 Annual wage reporting process.
###### Processing late and incorrect paper form reports.

(e)If SSA receives paper form wage reports after the due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. SSA will ask an employer to provide replacement forms for illegible, incomplete, or clearly erroneous paper reporting forms, or will ask the employer to provide information necessary to process the reports without having to resubmit corrected forms. (For wage reports where earnings are reported without a social security number or with an incorrect name or social security number, see ยง 422.120.) If an employer fails to provide legible, complete, and correct W-2 reports within 45 days, SSA may identify the employers to IRS for assessment of employer reporting penalties.
