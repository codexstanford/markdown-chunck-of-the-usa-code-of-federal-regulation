(a)This section applies to all records kept by SSA (as described in ยง 401.5) except for records of earnings. (20 CFR 422.125 describes how to request correction of your earnings record.) You may request that your record be corrected or amended if you believe that the record is not accurate, timely, complete, relevant, or necessary to the administration of a social security program. To amend or correct your record, you should write to the manager identified in the notice of systems of records which is published in the(see ยง 401.40(c) on how to locate this information). The staff at any social security office can help you prepare the request. You should submit any available evidence to support your request. Your request should indicate-

(1) The system of records from which the record is retrieved;

(2) The particular record which you want to correct or amend;

(3) Whether you want to add, delete or substitute information in the record; and

(4) Your reasons for believing that your record should be corrected or amended.
