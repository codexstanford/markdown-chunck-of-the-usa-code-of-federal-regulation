#### ยง 402.105 Exemption seven for withholding records: Law enforcement.
##### Enforcement proceedings.

(a)We may withhold information whose release could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category. In certain cases-such as when a fraud investigation is likely-we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that relate to the violations in order not to disclose that an investigation is in progress, or may be conducted.
