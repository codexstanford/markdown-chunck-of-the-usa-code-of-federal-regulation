###### ยง 222.43 How the one-half support determination is made.
####### Reasonable period of time.

(b)The employee is not providing at least one-half of a person's support unless the employee has made contributions for a reasonable period of time. Ordinarily, the Board will consider a reasonable period of time to be the 12-month period immediately preceding the time when the one-half support requirement must be satisfied. However, if the employee provided one-half or more of the person's support for at least 3 months of the 12-month period, and was forced to stop or reduce contributions because of circumstances beyond his or her control, such as illness or unemployment, and no one else took over responsibility for providing at least one-half of the person's support on a permanent basis, three months shall be considered a reasonable period of time.
