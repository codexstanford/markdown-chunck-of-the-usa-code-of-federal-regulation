###### ยง 418.3125 What are redeterminations?
####### Redeterminations defined.

(a)A redetermination is a periodic review of your eligibility to make sure that you are still eligible for a subsidy and if so, to determine whether you should continue to receive a full or partial subsidy. This review deals with evaluating your income and resources (and those of your spouse, who lives with you) and will not affect past months of eligibility. It will be used to determine your future subsidy eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy for future months. We will redetermine your eligibility if we made the initial determination of your eligibility or if you are deemed eligible because you receive SSI benefits. Rules regarding redeterminations of initial eligibility determinations made by a State are described in 42 CFR 423.774.
