###### ยง 416.2211 Criteria for determining when VR services will be considered to have contributed to a continuous period of 9 months.

The State VR agency may be paid for VR services if such services contribute to the individual's performance of a continuous 9-month period of SGA. The following criteria apply to individuals who received more than just evaluation services. If a State VR agency claims payment for services to an individual who received only evaluation services, it must establish that the individual's continuous period or medical recovery (if medical recovery occurred before completion of a continuous period) would not have occurred without the services provided. In applying the criteria below, we will consider services described in ยง 416.2214 that were initiated, coordinated or provided, including services before October 1, 1981.
