##### WARN not to supersede other laws and contracts.

(g)The provisions of WARN do not supersede any laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide for additional notice or additional rights and remedies.

Collective bargaining agreements may be used to clarify or amplify the terms and conditions of WARN, but may not reduce WARN rights.
