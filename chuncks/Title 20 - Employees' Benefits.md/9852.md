###### Federal Salary Offset: amount, frequency and duration of deductions.

(d)(1) Treasury may collect the overdue debt from an employee of the Federal Government through the deduction of an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the debtor's current disposable pay each payday.

(2) Federal Salary Offset will begin not less than 60 calendar days after the date of the notice to the debtor described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(3) Once begun, Federal Salary Offset will continue until Treasury recovers the full amount of the debt, the debt is otherwise resolved, or the debtor's Federal employment ceases, whichever occurs first.

(4) After Federal Salary Offset begins, the debtor may request a reduction in the amount deducted from disposable pay each payday. When Treasury determines that the amount deducted causes financial harm under the rules in ยง 422.833(j), they will reduce that amount. Treasury will not reduce the amount from the debtor's disposable pay if the debt was caused by:

(A) An intentional false statement by the debtor, or

(B) The debtor's willful concealment of, or failure to furnish, material information.

(2) "Willful concealment" means an intentional, knowing and purposeful delay in providing, or failure to reveal, material information.
