###### ยง 416.1166 How we deem income to you and your eligible child from your ineligible spouse.

If you and your eligible child live in the same household with your ineligible spouse, we deem your ineligible spouse's income first to you, and then we deem any remainder to your eligible child. For the purpose of this section, SSI benefits include any federally administered State supplement. We then follow the rules in ยง 416.1165(e) to determine the child's eligibility for SSI benefits and in ยง 416.1165(f) to determine the benefit amount.
