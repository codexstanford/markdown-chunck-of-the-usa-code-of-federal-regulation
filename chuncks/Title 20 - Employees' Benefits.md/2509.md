#### PART 348 - REPRESENTATIVE PAYMENT
##### ยง 348.1 Introduction.
###### Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.

(c)(1) The Board's policy is that every claimant has the right to manage his or her own benefits. However, due to mental or physical condition some claimants may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of a claimant would be better served if benefit payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the claimant is a legally competent individual. If the claimant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.

(2) If payment is being made directly to a claimant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the claimant has not been adjudged legally incompetent, continue to pay the claimant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.
