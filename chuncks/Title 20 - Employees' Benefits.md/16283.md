###### Conflicts of interest.

(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an enrolled actuary shall not perform actuarial services for a client if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if-

(i) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or

(ii) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the enrolled actuary's responsibilities to another client, a former client, or by a personal interest of the enrolled actuary.

(2) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the enrolled actuary may represent a client if-

(i) The enrolled actuary reasonably believes that he or she will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;

(ii) The representation is not prohibited by law; and

(iii) Each affected client waives the conflict of interest and gives informed consent at the time the existence of the conflict of interest is known by the enrolled actuary.
