###### ยง 416.1111 How we count earned income.
####### In-kind earned income.

(d)We use the current market value of in-kind earned income for SSI purposes. (See ยง 416.1101 for a definition of current market value.) If you receive an item that is not fully paid for and are responsible for the unpaid balance, only the paid-up value is income to you. (See the example in ยง 416.1123(c)).
