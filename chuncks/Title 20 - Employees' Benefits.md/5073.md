####### What you must do to receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision.

(g)(1) To receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision on our reconsideration determination, you must request a hearing and continuation of benefits no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our reconsideration determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. A hearing must be requested as provided in ยง 404.933, and you must request continued benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) If you request continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision but did not request continued benefits while we were reconsidering the initial cessation determination, your benefits will begin effective the month of the reconsideration determination.

(3) If you fail to request continued payment of benefits within the 10-day period required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, but you later ask that we continue your benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision on our reconsidered determination, we will use the rules as provided in ยง 404.911 to determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after receipt of the reconsideration determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the request to be timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.
