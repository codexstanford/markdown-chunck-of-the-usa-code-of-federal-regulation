##### ยง 655.737 What are "exempt" H-1B nonimmigrants, and how does their employment affect the additional attestation obligations of H-1B-dependent employers and willful violator employers?
###### How is the "master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment" to be determined?,i.e.,

(d)(1) "Master's or higher degree (or its equivalent)," for purposes of this section means a foreign academic degree from an institution which is accredited or recognized under the law of the country where the degree was obtained, and which is equivalent to a master's or higher degree issued by a U.S. academic institution. The equivalence to a U.S. academic degree cannot be established through experience or through demonstration of expertise in the academic specialty (no "time equivalency" or "performance equivalency" will be recognized as substituting for a degree issued by an academic institution). The DHS and the Department will consult appropriate sources of expertise in making the determination of equivalency between foreign and U.S. academic degrees. Upon the request of the DHS or the Department, the employer shall provide evidence to establish that the H-1B nonimmigrant has received the degree, that the degree was earned in the asserted field of study, including an academic transcript of courses, and that the institution from which the degree was obtained was accredited or recognized.

(2) "Specialty related to the intended employment," for purposes of this section, means that the academic degree is in a specialty which is generally accepted in the industry or occupation as an appropriate or necessary credential or skill for the person who undertakes the employment in question. A "specialty" which is not generally accepted as appropriate or necessary to the employment would not be considered to be sufficiently "related' to afford the H-1B nonimmigrant status as an "exempt H-1B nonimmigrant."
