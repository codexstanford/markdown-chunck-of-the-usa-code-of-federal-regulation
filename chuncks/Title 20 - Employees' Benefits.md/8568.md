###### ยง 416.1165 How we deem income to you from your ineligible parent(s).
####### Allocations for your ineligible parent(s).

(d)We next deduct allocations for your parent(s). We do not deduct an allocation for a parent who is receiving public income-maintenance payments (see ยง 416.1142(a)). The allocations are calculated as follows:

(1) We first deduct $20 from the parents' combined unearned income, if any. If they have less than $20 in unearned income, we subtract the balance of the $20 from their combined earned income.

(2) Next, we subtract $65 plus one-half the remainder of their earned income.

(3) We total the remaining earned and unearned income and subtract-

(i) The Federal benefit rate for the month for a couple if both parents live with you; or

(ii) The Federal benefit rate for the month for an individual if only one parent lives with you.
