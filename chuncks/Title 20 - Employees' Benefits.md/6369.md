(i) To do an age-appropriate activity, you must be able to understandrememberapply information required by the activity. Similarly, you must be able to concentratepersistmaintain pace in order to complete the activity, and adaptmanage yourself age-appropriately. Limitation in any one of these parts (understandrememberapply; concentratepersistmaintain pace; adaptmanage oneself) may prevent you from completing age-appropriate activities.

(ii) We will document the rating of limitation of the whole area of mental functioning, not each individual part. We will not add ratings of the parts together. For example, with respect to paragraph B3, if you have marked limitation in concentrating, but your limitations in persisting and maintaining pace do not rise to a marked level, we will find that you have marked limitation in the whole paragraph B3 area of mental functioning.

(iii) Marked limitation in more than one part of the same paragraph B area of mental functioning does not satisfy the requirement to have marked limitation in two paragraph B areas of mental functioning.
