####### The claimant's earnings may show the claimant has done substantial gainful activity.

(1)The amount of the claimant's earnings from work the claimant has done may show that he or she has engaged in substantial gainful activity. Generally, if the claimant worked for substantial earnings, this will show that he or she is able to do substantial gainful activity. On the other hand, the fact that the claimant's earnings are not substantial will not necessarily show that the claimant is not able to do substantial gainful activity. The Board will generally consider work that the claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's earnings from that work will not show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity.
