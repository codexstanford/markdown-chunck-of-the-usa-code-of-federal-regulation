###### Calculation of the required optional State supplementary payment level for flat grant amounts.,i.e.

(c)The optional State supplementary payment level for March 1983 for flat grant amounts is the total amount that an eligible individual (or couple) with no countable income received for March 1983 in excess of the FBR for March 1983. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later the amount calculated in the first sentence shall continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (, $10.30). If the State varied its payment levels for different groups of recipients (e.g., paid recipients different amounts based on eligibility categories, geographic areas, living arrangements, or marital status), each variation represents a separate supplementary payment level.
