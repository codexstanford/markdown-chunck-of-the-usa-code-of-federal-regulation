###### ยง 225.34 How the amount of the DRC is figured.

(a) The amount of the DRC depends on-

(1) The year the employee reaches full retirement age; and

(2) The number of months for which the credit is due, as explained in ยง 225.33.

(b) The percent given in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is multiplied by the PIA; that product is then multiplied by the number of months for which credit is due and rounded to the next lowest multiple of $0.10, if the answer is not already a multiple of $0.10. The result is the DRC which is added to the PIA.
