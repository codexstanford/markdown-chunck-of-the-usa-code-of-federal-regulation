###### ยง 418.3415 How do we determine countable resources?
####### General rule.

(a)Your countable resources are determined as of the first moment of the month for which we determine your eligibility based on your application for a subsidy or for which we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy. A resource determination is based on what assets you (and your living-with spouse, if any) have, what their values are, and whether they are excluded as of the first moment of the month. We will use this amount as your countable resources at the point when we determine your eligibility for the subsidy unless you report to us that the value of your resources has changed as described in ยง 418.3120.
