###### Notices to States about potential noncompliance.

(d)Within 90 days after the end of the relevant 12-month period, the Commissioner shall send a notice to any State that has not maintained its supplementary payment levels and that appears not to have maintained its total expenditures during the period. The notice will advise the State of the available methods of compliance and the time within which corrective action must be taken (see §§ 416.2096(b)(3) and 416.2096(c)(2)) in order to avoid a determination of noncompliance. If the State fails to take the corrective action, the Commissioner shall make a timely determination of noncompliance.
