####### Intermediate goals.

(d)Intermediate goals are levels of performance between the threshold levels and the target levels established by our appropriate Regional Commissioner after negotiation with each State agency. The intermediate goals are designed to help the State agencies reach the target levels. Failure to meet these goals is not a cause for considering the State agency to be substantially failing to comply with the performance standards. However, failure to meet the intermediate goals may result in consultation and an offer of optional performance support depending on the availability of our resources.
