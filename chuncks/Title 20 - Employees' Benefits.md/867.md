####### Instructions.

(1)An individual required to comply with instructions about when, where, and how to work is ordinarily an employee. Instructions may be oral or in the form of manuals or written procedures which show how the desired result is to be accomplished. An individual who ordinarily works without receiving instructions because he or she is highly skilled or knowledgeable may nevertheless be an employee if the employer has a right to instruct the individual in performance of the work.
