##### § 404.413 After my benefits are reduced for age what happens if there is an increase in my primary insurance amount?
###### What is the general rule on reduction of increases?

(a)After an individual's benefits are reduced for age under §§ 404.410 through 404.411, the primary insurance amount on which such benefits are based may subsequently be increased because of a recomputation, a general benefit increase pursuant to an amendment of the Act, or increases based upon a rise in the cost-of-living under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act. When the primary insurance amount increases the monthly benefit amount also increases.
