(a)The Board determines whether a pension established by a railroad employer is a private pension that will cause a reduction in the employee's supplemental annuity. A private pension for purposes of this subpart is a plan that:

(1) Is a written plan or arrangement which is communicated to the employees to whom it applies;

(2) Is established and maintained by an employer for a defined group of employees; and

(3) Provides for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or disability. Such a plan is sometimes referred to as a defined benefit plan.
