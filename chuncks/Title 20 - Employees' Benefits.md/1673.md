####### Computation.

(b)The employee vested dual benefit is computed as follows:

(1) The combined earnings dual benefit PIA is subtracted from the total of the railroad earnings dual benefit PIA and the social security earnings dual benefit PIA (see part 225 of this chapter for an explanation of these PIA's).

(2) The result from paragraph (b)(l) of this section is adjusted for any applicable cost-of-living increase, as shown in ยง 226.13 of this part.

(3) If the employee is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see ยง 216.1 of this chapter), the rate from paragraph (b)(2) of this section is reduced in the same manner as the tier I as provided for in ยง 226.10 of this part. In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is entitled to an annuity reduced for age, the age reduction applies only to the tier I component; no age reduction applies to the vested dual benefit.

(4) The vested dual benefit payable in a given year may also be reduced for insufficient funding as shown in part 233 of this chapter.
