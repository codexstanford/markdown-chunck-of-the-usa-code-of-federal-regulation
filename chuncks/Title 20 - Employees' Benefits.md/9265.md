###### Calculation of the required mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level.,i.e.

(b)(1) Except for States described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level for March 1983 is a recipient's December 1973 income, as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66, plus any State increases prior to April 1983, less any reductions made at any time after December 1973 due to changes in special needs or circumstances, less the March 1983 FBR. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later the amount calculated in the first sentence shall continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (, $10.30), so long as that reduction does not cause the mandatory minimum State supplementary level to fall below that required by section 212(a)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 93-66.
