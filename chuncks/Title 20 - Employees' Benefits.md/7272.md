###### ยง 411.165 How does using a ticket under the Ticket to Work program affect my continuing disability reviews?

We periodically review your case to determine if you are still disabled under our rules. However, we will not begin a continuing disability review during the period in which you are using a ticket. Sections 411.170 and 411.171 describe when the period of using a ticket begins and ends. You must meet certain requirements for us to consider you to be using a ticket.
