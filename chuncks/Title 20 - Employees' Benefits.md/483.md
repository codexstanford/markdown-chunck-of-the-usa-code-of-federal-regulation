###### Overpayments
####### ยง 30.520 How are overpayments collected?

(a) When an overpayment has been made to a recipient who is entitled to further payments, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention is called to same. If no refund is made, OWCP shall recover the overpayment by reducing any further lump-sum payments due currently or in the future, taking into account the financial circumstances of the recipient, and any other relevant factors, so as to minimize any hardship. Should the recipient die before collection has been completed, further collection shall be made by decreasing later payments, if any, payable under EEOICPA with respect to the underlying occupational illness or covered illness.
