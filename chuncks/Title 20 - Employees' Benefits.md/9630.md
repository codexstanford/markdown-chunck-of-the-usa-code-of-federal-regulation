###### General.

(a)Under the authority of section 232 of the Act, SSA and IRS have entered into an agreement that sets forth the manner by which SSA and IRS will ensure that the processing of employee wage reports is effective and efficient. Under this agreement, employers are instructed by IRS to file annual wage reports with SSA on paper Forms W-2, "Wage and Tax Statement," and Forms W-3, "Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements," or equivalent W-2 and W-3 magnetic media reports. Special versions of these forms for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are also filed with SSA. SSA processes all wage reporting forms for updating to SSA's earnings records and IRS tax records, identifies employer reporting errors and untimely filed forms for IRS penalty assessment action, and takes action to correct any reporting errors identified, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. SSA also processes Forms W-3c, "Transmittal of Corrected Income Tax Statements," and W-2c, "Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts" (and their magnetic media equivalents) that employers are required to file with SSA when certain previous reporting errors are discovered.
