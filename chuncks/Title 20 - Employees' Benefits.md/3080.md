###### ยง 404.130 How we determine disability insured status.
####### Rule III-You had a period of disability before age 31.

(d)You are insured in a quarter for purposes of establishing a period of disability or becoming entitled to disability insurance benefits if in that quarter-

(1) You are disabled again at age 31 or later after having had a prior period of disability established which began before age 31 and for which you were only insured under paragraph (c) of this section; and

(2) You are fully insured and have QCs in at least one-half the calendar quarters in the period beginning with the quarter after the quarter you became age 21 and through the quarter in which the later period of disability begins, up to a maximum of 20 QCs out of 40 calendar quarters; however-

(i) If the number of quarters during this period is an odd number, we reduce the number by one;

(ii) If the period has less than 12 quarters, you must have at least 6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with that quarter; and

(iii) No monthly benefits may be paid or increased under Rule III before May 1983.
