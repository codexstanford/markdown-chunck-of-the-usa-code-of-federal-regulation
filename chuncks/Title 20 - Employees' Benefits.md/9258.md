###### State agreements to maintain supplementary payment levels.

(a)(1) In order to be eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement, any State that makes supplementary payments, other than payments to residents of Medicaid facilities where Medicaid pays more than 50 percent of the cost of their care (see paragraph (d) of this section for definition of Medicaid facility and ยง 416.414 for discussion of the reduced SSI benefit amount payable to residents of Medicaid facilities), on or after June 30, 1977, must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner. In this agreement-

(i) The State must agree to continue to make the supplementary payments;

(ii) For months from July 1977 through March 1983, the State must agree to maintain the supplementary payments at levels at least equal to the December 1976 levels (or, if a State first makes supplementary payments after December 1976, the levels for the first month the State makes supplementary payments). For months in the period July 1, 1982 through March 31, 1983, a State may elect to maintain the levels described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

(iii) For months after March 1983, the State must agree to maintain supplementary payments at least sufficient to maintain the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels in effect in March 1983, increased by any subsequent SSI benefit increases, except as provided in ยง 416.2097(b) and ยง 416.2097(c).

(2) We will find that the State has met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the State has the appropriate agreement in effect and complies with the conditions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. We will consider a State to have made supplementary payments on or after June 30, 1977, unless the State furnishes us satisfactory evidence to the contrary.
