# Title 20 - Employees' Benefits
## Chapter V - Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor
### PART 651 - GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE WAGNER-PEYSER ACT EMPLOYMENT SERVICE
#### ยง 651.10 Definitions of terms used in this part and parts 652, 653, 654, and 658 of this chapter.
##### Bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ)

means that an employment decision or request based on age, sex, national origin or religion is based on a finding that such characteristic is necessary to the individual's ability to perform the job in question. Since a BFOQ is an exception to the general prohibition against discrimination on the basis of age, sex, national origin, or religion, it must be interpreted narrowly in accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations set forth at 29 CFR parts 1604, 1605, and 1627.
