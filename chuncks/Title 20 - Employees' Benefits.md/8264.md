####### Persons who were found disabled under a State plan.

(c)If you became entitled to benefits because you were found to be disabled under a State plan, we will first evaluate your impairment(s) under the rules explained in paragraph (b) of this section. We will apply the same steps as described in paragraph (b) of this section to the last decision granting or affirming entitlement to benefits under the State plan. If we are not able to find that your disability continues on the basis of these rules, we will then evaluate your impairment(s) under the appropriate State plan. If we are not able to find that your disability continues under these State plan criteria, we will find that your disability ends. Disability will be found to end the month the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled under the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section (or appropriate State plan criteria), subject to the rules set out in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
