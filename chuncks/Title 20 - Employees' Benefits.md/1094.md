###### ยง 219.7 How the Board decides what is convincing evidence.

When the Board receives evidence, a Board representative examines it to see if it is convincing evidence. If it is, no other evidence is needed. In deciding whether the evidence is convincing, the Board representative decides whether-

(a) The information contained in the evidence was given by a person in a position to know the facts;

(b) There was any reason to give false information when the evidence was created;

(c) The information contained in the evidence was given under oath, or in the presence of witnesses, or with the knowledge that there was a penalty for giving false information;

(d) The evidence was created at the time the event took place or shortly after;

(e) The evidence has been altered or has any erasures on it; and

(f) The information contained in the evidence agrees with other available evidence, including existing Board records.
