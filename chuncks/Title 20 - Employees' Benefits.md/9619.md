###### Evidence of U.S. citizenship.

(d)Generally, an applicant for an original or replacement social security number card may prove that he or she is a U.S. citizen by birth by submitting a birth certificate or other evidence, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, that shows a U.S. place of birth. Where a foreign-born applicant claims U.S. citizenship, the applicant for a social security number or a replacement social security number card is required to present documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship. If required evidence is not available, a social security number card will not be issued until satisfactory evidence of U.S. citizenship is furnished. Any of the following is generally acceptable evidence of U.S. citizenship for a foreign-born applicant:

(1) Certificate of naturalization;

(2) Certificate of citizenship;

(3) U.S. passport;

(4) U.S. citizen identification card issued by the Department of Homeland Security;

(5) Consular report of birth (State Department form FS-240 or FS-545); or

(6) Other verification from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of State, or Federal or State court records confirming citizenship.
