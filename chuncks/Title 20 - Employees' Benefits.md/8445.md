###### ยง 416.1112 Earned income we do not count.
####### General.

(a)While we must know the source and amount of all of your earned income for SSI, we do not count all of it to determine your eligibility and benefit amount. We first exclude income as authorized by other Federal laws (see paragraph (b) of this section). Then we apply the other exclusions in the order listed in paragraph (c) of this section to the rest of your income in the month. We never reduce your earned income below zero or apply any unused earned income exclusion to unearned income.
