#### Subpart C - Computing Primary Insurance Amounts
##### Recomputing Your Primary Insurance Amount
###### ยง 404.281 Why your primary insurance amount may be recomputed.
####### Earnings not reported to us in time to use them in the computation of your primary insurance amount.

(d)Because of the way reports of earnings are required to be submitted to us for years after 1977, the earnings you have in the year before you become entitled to old-age insurance benefits, or become disabled or in the year you die might not be reported to us in time to use them in computing your primary insurance amount. We recompute your primary insurance amount based on the new earnings information and begin paying you (or your survivors) the higher benefits based on the additional earnings, beginning with the month you became entitled or died.
