Compensation claimed by an employee, which is not credited in the records of the Board, must be verified to the satisfaction of the Board before it may be credited. An employee's claim to compensation not credited shall be processed as follows:

(a) If the compensation claimed is in excess of the maximum creditable amounts defined in ยง 211.13 of this part, the Director of the Bureau of Research and Employment Accounts shall inform the employee that the compensation claimed is not creditable.

(b) If the compensation is claimed within four years from the date the compensation was required to be reported to the Board as prescribed in ยง 209.6 of this chapter, the Director of Research and Employment Accounts shall contact the employer requesting a review of their records, and if the employee's claim is correct, the employer will submit an adjustment crediting the employee with the compensation claimed. If the employer states that the employee's claim is incorrect, the employee will be requested to submit check stubs to show railroad retirement taxes withheld from the compensation claimed. Upon receipt of the check stubs, the proof will be sent to the employer along with a request for the employer to submit an adjustment crediting the employee with the compensation claimed.
