###### ยง 404.1594 How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends.
####### Prior residual functional capacity assessment should have been made, but was not.,i.e.

(iii)If the most recent favorable medical decision should have contained an assessment of your residual functional capacity (, your impairments did not meet or equal the level of severity contemplated by the Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 of this subpart) but does not, either because this assessment is missing from your file or because it was not done, we will reconstruct the residual functional capacity. This reconstructed residual functional capacity will accurately and objectively assess your functional capacity to do basic work activities. We will assign the maximum functional capacity consistent with an allowance.
