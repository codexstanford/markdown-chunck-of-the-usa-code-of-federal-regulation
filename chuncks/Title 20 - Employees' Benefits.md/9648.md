###### Determinations and notice to individuals.

(c)In the case of an application for benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a lump-sum death payment, a recomputation of a primary insurance amount, or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or supplementary medical insurance benefits, after obtaining the necessary evidence, we will determine, based on the preponderance of the evidence (see §§ 404.901 and 416.1401 of this chapter) as to the entitlement of the individual claiming or for whom is claimed such benefits, and will notify the applicant of the determination and of his right to appeal. Section 404.1503 of this chapter has a discussion of the respective roles of State agencies and the Administration in the making of disability determinations and information regarding initial determinations as to entitlement or termination of entitlement in disability claims. See section 1869(a) of the Social Security Act for determinations under the health insurance for the aged program and sections 1816 and 1842 of the Act for the role of intermediaries, carriers, and State agencies in performing certain functions under such program, e.g., payment of claims pursuant to an agreement with the Social Security Administration.
