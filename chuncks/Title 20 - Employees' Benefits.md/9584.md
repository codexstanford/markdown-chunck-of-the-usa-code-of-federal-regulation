###### ยง 418.3630 How do you request administrative review?
####### When we will extend the time period to request administrative review.

(c)If you want a review of the initial determination but do not request one within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the initial determination, you may ask us for more time to request a review. Your request for an extension must explain why it was not filed within the stated time period. If you show us that you had good cause for missing the deadline, we will extend the time period. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in ยง 418.3640.
