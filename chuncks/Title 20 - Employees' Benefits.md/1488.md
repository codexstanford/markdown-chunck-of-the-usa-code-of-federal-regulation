B.-This category of tests refers to non-imaging studies.

2.11 If there are no "highly recommended" confirmatory tests designated to confirm an impairment and the "recommended" confirmatory tests only include non-imaging procedures, at least one of these tests should be positive to confirm the impairment. The greater the number of tests that are positive, the greater the confidence that the correct diagnosis has been established.
