###### ยง 416.1161a Income for deeming purposes where Medicaid eligibility is affected.
####### When special deeming rules apply:

(b)

(1) The Department will consider not applying the usual deeming rules only upon application by a State Medicaid agency (requirement approved under OMB No. 0960-0304) and on condition that the agency must show:

(i) Deeming would result in lack of Medicaid eligibility for the individual.

(ii) Medicaid eligibility would, prospectively, result in savings to the Medicaid program; and

(iii) The quality of medical care necessary for the individual would be maintained under the arrangements contemplated.

(2) The Department may also in particular cases require that additional facts be demonstrated, or that other criteria or standards be met, before it determines not to apply the usual deeming rules.
