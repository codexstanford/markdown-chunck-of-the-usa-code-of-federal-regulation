####### Subsidy

(13)means an amount CMS will pay on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for a subsidy of their Medicare Part D costs. The amount of a subsidy for a Medicare beneficiary depends on the beneficiary's income as related to household size, resources, and late enrollment penalties (if any) as explained in 42 CFR 423.780 and 42 CFR 423.782. We do not determine the amount of the subsidy, only whether or not the individual is eligible for a full or partial subsidy.
