###### Monitoring program.

(4)In order to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the TAA Program, States must adopt a formal monitoring program designed to review and audit worker files.

(i) The monitoring program must be designed to identify and share best practices, identify and correct deficiencies, and identify and address staff training needs.

(ii) A minimum quarterly random sample of 20 cases must be audited as part of the monitoring program and must include cases from at least 2 certifications issued under subpart B of this part.

(iii) The four quarterly samples within a calendar year must also cover at least four different areas of the State administering the program.

(iv) If circumstances preclude a State from meeting the criteria in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the State must contact the appropriate ETA regional office to design a monitoring program that better suits the TAA Program in that State, and make sure it is sufficient to ensure the accuracy and verifiability of such data.
