###### ยง 220.129 Education as a vocational factor.
####### Inability to communicate in English.

(5)Since the ability to speak, read, and understand English is generally learned or increased at school, the Board may consider this an educational factor. Because English is the dominant language of the country, it may be difficult for the claimant who does not speak and understand English to do a job, regardless of the amount of education he or she may have in another language. The claimant's ability to speak, read and understand English will be considered when the Board evaluates what work, if any, he or she can do.
