##### ยง 681.250 Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply to?

(a) For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either basic skills deficient or an English language learner, and youth who require additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment, must be low-income. All other OSY meeting OSY eligibility under ยง 681.210(c)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) are not required to be low-income.

(b) All ISY must be low-income to meet the ISY eligibility criteria, except those that fall under the low-income exception.

(c) WIOA allows a low-income exception where five percent of WIOA youth may be participants who ordinarily would be required to be low-income for eligibility purposes and meet all other eligibility criteria for WIOA youth except the low-income criteria. A program must calculate the five percent based on the percent of newly enrolled youth in the local area's WIOA youth program in a given program year who would ordinarily be required to meet the low-income criteria.
