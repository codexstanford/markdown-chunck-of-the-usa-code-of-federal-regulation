###### Determining the administration fee.

(2)The administration fee is assessed and paid monthly and is derived by multiplying the number of State recognition payments we make on behalf of a State for any month in a fiscal year by the applicable dollar rate for the fiscal year. The number of recognition payments we make in a month is the total number of checks we issue, and direct deposits we make, to recipients in that month, that are composed in whole or in part of State recognition funds. The dollar amounts are as follows:

(i) For fiscal year 2001, $8.10;

(ii) For fiscal year 2002, $8.50; and

(iii) For fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year-

(A) The applicable rate in the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year of the increase exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the increase, and rounded to the nearest whole cent; or

(B) A different rate if the Commissioner determines the different rate is appropriate for the State considering the complexity of administering the State's recognition payment program.
