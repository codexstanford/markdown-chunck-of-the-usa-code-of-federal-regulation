###### ยง 416.1151 How we treat the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen resources.
####### Interest on cash for repair or replacement of a noncash resource.

(b)We do not count any interest earned on the cash you receive for repair or replacement of a noncash resource if the interest is earned within 9 months of the date you receive the cash. We can extend the 9-month period for up to an additional 9 months if we find you have good cause for not repairing or replacing the resource within the initial period. Good cause exists, for example, if you show that circumstances beyond your control prevent the repair or replacement, or contracting for the repair or replacement, of the resource within the first 9-month period.
