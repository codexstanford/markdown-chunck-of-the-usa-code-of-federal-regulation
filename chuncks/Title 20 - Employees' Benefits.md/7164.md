###### ยง 408.950 Will we accept a compromise settlement of an overpayment debt or suspend or terminate collection of an overpayment?
####### Effect of compromise, suspension or termination.

(c)When we suspend or terminate collection of the overpayment debt, we may take collection action in the future in accordance with provisions of the Social Security Act, other laws, and the standards set forth in 31 CFR chapter IX. A compromise settlement satisfies the obligation to repay the overpayment if you or your estate comply with the terms of the settlement. Failure to make payment in the manner and within the time that we require in the settlement will result in reinstatement of our claim for the full amount of the overpayment less any amounts paid.
