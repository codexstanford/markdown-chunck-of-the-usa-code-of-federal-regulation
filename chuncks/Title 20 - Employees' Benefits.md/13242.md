##### ยง 655.738 What are the "non-displacement of U.S. workers" obligations that apply to H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators, and how do they operate?
###### Job responsibilities.

(i)The job of the H-1B nonimmigrant must involve essentially the same duties and responsibilities as the job from which the U.S. worker was laid off. The comparison focuses on the core elements of and competencies for the job, such as supervisory duties, or design and engineering functions, or budget and financial accountability. Peripheral, non-essential duties that could be tailored to the particular abilities of the individual workers would not be determinative in this comparison. The job responsibilities must be similar and both workers capable of performing those duties.
