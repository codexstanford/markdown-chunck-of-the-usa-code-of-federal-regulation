####### symptoms, signs,,laboratory findings

(2) The terms symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings are defined in ยง 416.902. For children, our definitions of the termsandmay include any abnormalities of physical and mental functioning that we used in making our most recent favorable decision.

(3) Some impairments are subject to temporary remissions, which can give the appearance of medical improvement when in fact there has been none. If you have the kind of impairment that is subject to temporary remissions, we will be careful to consider the longitudinal history of the impairment, including the occurrence of prior remissions and prospects for future worsenings, when we decide whether there has been medical improvement. Improvements that are only temporary will not warrant a finding of medical improvement.
