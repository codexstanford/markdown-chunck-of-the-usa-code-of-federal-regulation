###### Report; content and form.

(d)A report required under the provisions of this section shall be filed with the Social Security Administration. (See ยง 404.614 of this part for procedures concerning place of filing and date of receipt of such a report.) The report should be made on a form prescribed by the Administration and in accordance with instructions, printed thereon or attached thereto, as prescribed by the Administration. Prescribed forms may be obtained at any office of the Administration. If the prescribed form is not used, the report should be properly identified (e.g., show the name and social security claim number of the beneficiary about whom the report is made), describe the events being reported, tell when the events occurred, furnish any other pertinent data (e.g., who has care of the children), and be properly authenticated (e.g., bear the signature and address of the beneficiary making the report or the person reporting on his behalf). The report should contain all the information needed for a proper determination of whether a deduction applies and, if it does, the period for which such deductions should be made.
