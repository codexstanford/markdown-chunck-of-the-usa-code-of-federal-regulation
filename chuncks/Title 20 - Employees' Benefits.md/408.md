###### Eligibility Criteria for Claims Relating to Radiogenic Cancer Under Parts B and E of EEOICPA
####### ยง 30.213 How does a claimant establish that the radiogenic cancer was at least as likely as not related to employment at the DOE facility, the atomic weapons employer facility, or the RECA section 5 facility?
######## i.e.

(b) HHS's regulations satisfy the legal requirements in section 7384n(c) of the Act, which also sets out OWCP's obligation to use them in its adjudication of claims for radiogenic cancer filed under Part B of the Act, and provide the factual basis for OWCP to determine if the "probability of causation" (PoC) that an employee's cancer was sustained in the performance of duty is 50% or greater (, it is "at least as likely as not" causally related to employment), as required under section 7384n(b).

(c) OWCP also uses HHS's regulations when it makes the determination required by section 7385s-4(c)(1)(A) of the Act, since those regulations provide the factual basis for OWCP to determine if "it is at least as likely as not" that exposure to radiation at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate, was a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the employee's radiogenic cancer claimed under Part E. For cancer claims under Part E, if the PoC is less than 50% and the claimant alleges that the employee was exposed to additional toxic substances, OWCP will determine if the claim is otherwise compensable pursuant to ยง 30.230(d) of this part.
