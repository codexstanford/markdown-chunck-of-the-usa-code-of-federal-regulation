###### ยง 418.3320 How do we count your earned income?
####### Period for which earned income is counted.

(f)For purposes of determining subsidy eligibility and, if eligible, whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we consider all of the countable earned income you receive (or expect to receive) during the year for which we are determining your eligibility for this subsidy. However, in the first year that you or your spouse apply for the subsidy, we consider all of the countable earned income you and your living-with spouse receive (or expect to receive) starting in the month for which we determine your eligibility based on your application for a subsidy through the end of the year for which we are determining your eligibility. If we count your income for only a portion of the year, the income limit for subsidy eligibility will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if we count your income for 6 consecutive months of the year (July through December), the income limit for subsidy eligibility will be half of the income limit applicable for the full year.
