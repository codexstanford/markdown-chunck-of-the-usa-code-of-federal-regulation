####### What the Board means by substantial income.

(c)After the claimant's normal business expenses are deducted from the claimant's gross income to determine net income, the Board will deduct the reasonable value of any unpaid help, any soil bank payments that were included as farm income, and impairment-related work expenses described in ยง 220.145 that have not been deducted in determining the claimant's net earnings from self-employment. The Board will consider the resulting amount of income from the business to be substantial if-

(1) It averages more than the amounts described in ยง 220.143(b)(2); or

(2) It averages less than the amounts described in ยง 220.143(b)(2) but the livelihood which the claimant gets from the business is either comparable to what it was before the claimant became severely impaired or is comparable to that of unimpaired self-employed persons in the claimant's community who are in the same or similar businesses as their means of livelihood.
