###### Alternative required optional State supplementary payment level for July 1982 through March 1983.

(g)States which were in compliance solely under the total-expenditures test for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1982, had the option of substituting December 1981 for December 1976 and switching to the maintenance-of-payment-levels test for July 1982 through March 1983 (see ยง 416.2096(b)(2)). If this situation applies, determine the December 1981 State supplementary payment levels for categories described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section by substituting "December 1981" for "March 1983" and "January 1982" for "April 1983" whenever they appear in these paragraphs only.
