####### Reduction for family maximum.

(d)The spouse's and child(ren)'s share of the Overall Minimum PIA are reduced if the total benefits are higher than the family maximum amount. These auxiliary shares are adjusted so that they each receive a proportionate share of the family maximum amount over and above the employee benefit. This adjustment is before adjustment for age or other benefits. The spouse and child(ren)'s benefits are computed as follows:

(1) The Overall Minimum PIA is subtracted from the family maximum amount.

(2) The result from paragraph (d)(1) of this section is divided by the total number of auxiliary beneficiaries (spouse and children).

(3) If the amount of each benefit from paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not a multiple of $0.10, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10. After determining the beneficiary's share (the amount after reduction for other benefits) the amount is rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1.00, if it is not already a multiple of $1.00.
