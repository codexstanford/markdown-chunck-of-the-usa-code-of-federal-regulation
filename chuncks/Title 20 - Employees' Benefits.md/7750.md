###### ยง 416.730 Penalty period: Three or more failures to report.
####### Extension of third (or a following) penalty period.

(b)Just as with the first and second penalty periods, if you have good cause for not making a report on time during the third (or a following) penalty period (see ยง 416.732), we will extend the penalty period to the day when we learn that you should have made another required report, but did not do so within 10 days after the close of the month in which the event happened. There may be more than one required report overdue at the end of an extended penalty period, but we will impose no more than one penalty deduction for any one extended penalty period.
