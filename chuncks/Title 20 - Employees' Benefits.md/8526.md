###### ยง 416.1160 What is deeming of income?
####### Ineligible parent.,i.e.

(2)If you are a child to whom deeming rules apply (see ยง 416.1165), we look at your ineligible parent's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. If you live with both your parent and your parent's spouse (, your stepparent), we also look at your stepparent's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. We do this because we expect your parent (and your stepparent, if living with you and your parent) to use some of his or her income to take care of your needs.
