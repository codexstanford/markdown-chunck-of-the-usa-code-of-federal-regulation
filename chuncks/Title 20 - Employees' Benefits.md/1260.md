#### PART 220 - DETERMINING DISABILITY
##### Subpart H - Evaluation of Disability
###### ยง 220.100 Evaluation of disability for any regular employment.
####### Impairment(s) must prevent any other work.

(5)(i) If the claimant is unable to do his or her past relevant work because of his or her impairment or combination of impairments, the Board will review the claimant's residual functional capacity and his or her age, education and work experience to determine if the claimant is able to do any other work. If the claimant cannot do other work, the Board will find him or her disabled. If the claimant can do other work, the Board will find the claimant not disabled.

(ii) If the claimant has only a marginal education (see ยง 220.129) and long work experience (i.e., 35 years or more) in which he or she only did arduous unskilled physical labor, and the claimant can no longer do this kind of work, the Board will use a different rule (see ยง 220.127) to determine disability.

(c) Once a claimant has been found eligible to receive a disability annuity, the Board follows a somewhat different order of evaluation to determine whether the claimant's eligibility continues as explained in ยง 220.180.
