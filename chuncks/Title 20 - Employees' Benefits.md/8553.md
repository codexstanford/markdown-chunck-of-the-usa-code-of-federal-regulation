###### ยง 416.1163 How we deem income to you from your ineligible spouse.
####### Allocations for ineligible children.,Exception:

(b)We then deduct an allocation for ineligible children in the household to help meet their needs.We do not allocate for ineligible children who are receiving public income-maintenance payments (see ยง 416.1142(a)).

(1) The allocation for each ineligible child is the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual. The amount of the allocation automatically increases whenever the Federal benefit rate increases. The amount of the allocation that we use to determine the amount of a benefit for a current month is based on the Federal benefit rate that applied in the second prior month unless one of the exceptions in ยง 416.1160(b)(2) applies.

(2) Each ineligible child's allocation is reduced by the amount of his or her own income as described in ยง 416.1161(c).

(3) We first deduct the allocations from your ineligible spouse's unearned income. If your ineligible spouse does not have enough unearned income to cover the allocations we deduct the balance from your ineligible spouse's earned income.
