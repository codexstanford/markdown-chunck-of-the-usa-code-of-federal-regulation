####### Statement of choice.

(d)When you or another party request reconsideration under ยง 404.908(a) or a hearing before an administrative law judge under ยง 404.932(a) on our determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling, or if your case is sent back (remanded) to an administrative law judge for further action, we will explain your right to receive continued benefits and ask you to complete a statement specifying which benefits you wish to have continued pending the outcome of the reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge. You may elect to receive only Medicare benefits during appeal even if you do not want to receive continued disability benefits. If anyone else is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income (or because of your entitlement to benefits based on disability), we will ask you to complete a statement specifying which benefits you wish to have continued for them, pending the outcome of the request for reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge. If you request appeal but you do not want to receive continued benefits, we will ask you to complete a statement declining continued benefits indicating that you do not want to have your benefits and those of your family, if any, continued during the appeal.
