###### ยง 416.2210 What we mean by "SGA" and by "a continuous period of 9 months".
####### What work we consider.

(c)In determining if a continuous period of SGA has been completed, all of an individual's work activity may be evaluated for purposes of this section, including work performed before October 1, 1981, during a trial work period, and after eligibility for disability or blindness payments ended. We will ordinarily consider only the first 9 months of SGA that occurs. The exception will be if an individual who completed 9 months of SGA later stops performing SGA, received VR services and then performs SGA for a 9-month period. See ยง 416.2215 for the use of the continuous period in determining payment for VR services.
