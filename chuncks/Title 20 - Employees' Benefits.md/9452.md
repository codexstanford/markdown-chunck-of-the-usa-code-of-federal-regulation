###### ยง 418.2120 How do we determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
####### Tables of applicable percentage.

(b)The tables in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section contain the modified adjusted gross income ranges for calendar years 2011 through and including 2017, 2018, and 2019, and the corresponding percentage of the cost of basic Medicare prescription drug coverage that individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes that fall within each of the ranges will pay. The monthly dollar amounts will be determined by CMS using the formula in section 1860D-13(a)(7)(B) of the Act. Based on your tax filing status for the tax year we use to make a determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we will determine which table is applicable to you. We will use your modified adjusted gross income to determine which income-related monthly adjustment amount to apply to you. The dollar amounts used for each of the ranges of income-related monthly adjustment will be set annually after 2019 as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The modified adjusted gross income ranges will be adjusted annually after 2019 as described in ยง 418.2115(e).
