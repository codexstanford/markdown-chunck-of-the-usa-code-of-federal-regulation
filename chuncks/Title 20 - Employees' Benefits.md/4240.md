####### Tips.

(h)(1) We include as wages tips received by an employee if-

(i) The tips are paid in cash; and

(ii) The tips amount to $20 or more and are received in the course of employment by an employee in a calendar month.

(2) Cash tips include checks and other forms of money. Tips received in a form other than cash, such as passes, tickets, or other goods are not wages. If an employee works for more than one employer in a calendar month, we apply the $20 tip test to work done for each employer.
