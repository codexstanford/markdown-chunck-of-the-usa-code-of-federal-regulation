##### Secretary's interpretation of federal law requirements:

B.1. The Secretary interprets section 3304(a)(1) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and section 303(a)(2) of the Social Security Act to require that a State law provide for payment of unemployment compensation solely through public employment offices or claims offices administered by the State employment security agency if such agency provides for such coordination in the operations of its public employment offices and claims offices as will insure (a) the payment of benefits only to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work and available for work, and (b) that individuals claiming unemployment compensation (claimants) are afforded such placement and other employment services as are necessary and appropriate to return them to suitable work as soon as possible.

2. The Secretary interprets all the above sections to require that a State law provide for: a. Such contact by claimants with public employment offices or claims offices or both, (1) as will reasonably insure the payment of unemployment compensation only to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work and available for work, and (2) that claimants are afforded such placement and other employment services as are necessary and appropriate to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as possible; and b. Methods of administration which do not unreasonably limit the opportunity of individuals to establish their right to unemployment compensation due under such State law.
