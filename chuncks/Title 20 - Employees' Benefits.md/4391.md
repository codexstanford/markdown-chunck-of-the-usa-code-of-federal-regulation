(a)For Social Security coverage purposes under section 218 of the Act, a police officer's or firefighter's position is any position so classified under State statutes or court decisions. Generally, these positions are in the organized police and fire departments of incorporated cities, towns, and villages. In most States, a police officer is a member of the "police" which is an organized civil force for maintaining order, preventing and detecting crimes, and enforcing laws. The terms "police officer" and "firefighter" do not include services in positions which, although connected with police and firefighting functions, are not police officer or firefighter positions.
