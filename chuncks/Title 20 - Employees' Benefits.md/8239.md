###### ยง 416.994 How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends, disabled adults.
####### Substantial evidence shows that you are the beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to your ability to work).

(i)Advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology are improvements in treatment or rehabilitative methods which have increased your ability to do basic work activities. We will apply this exception when substantial evidence shows that you have been the beneficiary of services which reflect these advances and they have favorably affected the severity of your impairment or your ability to do basic work activities. This decision will be based on new medical evidence and a new residual functional capacity assessment. (See ยง 416.945.) This exception does not apply if you are eligible to receive special Supplemental Security Income cash benefits as explained in ยง 416.261. In many instances, an advanced medical therapy or technology will result in a decrease in severity as shown by symptoms, signs and laboratory findings which will meet the definition of medical improvement. This exception will, therefore, see very limited application.
