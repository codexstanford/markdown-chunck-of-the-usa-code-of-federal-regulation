(b)(1)(i) Unless excepted by the DOJ, we will complete a CCLR and associated signed Certificate of Indebtedness to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to the DOJ for litigation.

(ii) We will complete all sections of the CCLR appropriate to each debt as required by the CCLR instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.

(2) We will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions that we wish the DOJ to take with respect to the referred debt. We may indicate specifically any of a number of litigation activities the DOJ may choose to pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforced collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.

(3) We will also use the CCLR to refer a debt to the DOJ for the purpose of obtaining any necessary approval of a proposal to compromise a debt or to suspend or terminate administrative collection activity on a debt.
