###### ยง 222.43 How the one-half support determination is made.
####### Amount of contributions.

(a)The employee provides one-half support to a person if the employee makes regular contributions to that person's support, and the amount of the contributions is equal to or in excess of one-half of the person's ordinary and necessary living expenses. Ordinary and necessary living expenses are the costs for food, clothing, housing, routine medical care, and similar necessities. A contribution may be in cash, goods, or services (see ยง 222.42 of this part). For example, an employee pays rent and utilities amounting to $6,000 per year on an apartment in which his mother resides. In addition, the employee's mother receives $3,600 per year in social security benefits which she uses to pay for her food, clothing and medical care. The mother's total necessary living expenses are $9,600 ($6,000 + $3,600). Since the employee contributes $6,000 toward these expenses, he is contributing in excess of one-half of his mother's support.
