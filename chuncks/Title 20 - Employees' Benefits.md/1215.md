(iii) In order to be entitled to a period of disability, an employee must apply while he or she is disabled or not later than 12 months after the month in which the period of disability ends.

(iv) An employee who is unable to apply within the 12-month period after the period of disability ends because his or her physical condition limited his or her activities to the extent that he or she could not complete and sign an application or because he or she was mentally incompetent, may apply no later than 36 months after the period of disability ends.

(v) A period of disability can also be established on the basis of an application filed within 3 months after the month a disabled employee died.
