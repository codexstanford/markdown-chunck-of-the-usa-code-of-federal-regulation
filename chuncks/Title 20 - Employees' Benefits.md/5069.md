####### Continuation of benefits for anyone else pending your appeal.

(c)(1) When you file a request for reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge on our determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling, or your case has been sent back (remanded) to an administrative law judge for further action, you may also choose to have benefits continue for anyone else who is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income (and for anyone else receiving benefits because of your entitlement to benefits based on disability), pending the outcome of your appeal.

(2) If anyone else is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income, we will notify him or her of the right to choose to have his or her benefits continue pending the outcome of your appeal. Such benefits can be continued for the time period in paragraph (b) of this section only if he or she chooses to have benefits continued and you also choose to have his or her benefits continued.
