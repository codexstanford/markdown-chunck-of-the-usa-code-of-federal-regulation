(c) Example: Employeesuffers a covered workplace injury on April 1, 2003, and is permanently totally disabled from that day forward. He was earning $250.00 a week when he was injured. His calculated compensation rate is $166.67 ($250 x 2 &#xF7; 3). The FY 2003 minimum rate is $249.14. Becausecalculated compensation rate is below the FY 2003 minimum rate, and his actual weekly wage is above that rate, he is entitled to compensation at the minimum rate of $249.14 from April 1, 2003, to September 30, 2003. The FY 2004 minimum rate is $257.70. Becauseactual weekly wages on the date of disability are lower than the FY 2004 minimum rate,minimum weekly compensation rate for FY 2004 is $250.00. His weekly compensation rate for FY 2004, however, is higher because of a section 10(f) adjustment. For FY 2004,compensation rate is increased by a 3.44% section 10(f) adjustment, raising his compensation level to $258.00 ($249.14 x .0344 = $8.57; $249.14 + $8.57 = $257.71, rounded to the nearest dollar).
