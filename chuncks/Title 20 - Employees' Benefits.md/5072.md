####### What you must do to receive continued benefits pending notice of our reconsideration determination.

(f)(1) If you want to receive continued benefits pending the outcome of your request for reconsideration, you must request reconsideration and continuation of benefits no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our initial determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. Reconsideration must be requested as provided in ยง 404.909, and you must request continued benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) If you fail to request reconsideration and continued benefits within the 10-day period required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but later ask that we continue your benefits pending a reconsidered determination, we will use the rules in ยง 404.911 to determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after receipt of the notice of the initial cessation determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the request to be timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.
