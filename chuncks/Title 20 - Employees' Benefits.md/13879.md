##### § 658.501 Basis for discontinuation of services.

(a) SWA officials must initiate procedures for discontinuation of services to employers who:

(1) Submit and refuse to alter or withdraw job orders containing specifications which are contrary to employment-related laws;

(2) Submit job orders and refuse to provide assurances, in accordance with the Agricultural Recruitment System for U.S. Workers at part 653, subpart F, of this chapter, that the jobs offered are in compliance with employment-related laws, or to withdraw such job orders;

(3) Are found through field checks or otherwise to have either misrepresented the terms or conditions of employment specified on job orders or failed to comply fully with assurances made on job orders;

(4) Are found by a final determination by an appropriate enforcement agency to have violated any employment-related laws and notification of this final determination has been provided to the Department or the SWA by that enforcement agency;

(5) Are found to have violated ES regulations pursuant to § 658.411;

(6) Refuse to accept qualified workers referred through the clearance system;

(7) Refuse to cooperate in the conduct of field checks conducted pursuant to § 653.503 of this chapter; or

(8) Repeatedly cause the initiation of the procedures for discontinuation of services pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.

(b) SWA officials may discontinue services immediately if, in the judgment of the State Administrator, exhaustion of the administrative procedures set forth in this subpart in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section would cause substantial harm to a significant number of workers. In such instances, procedures at §§ 658.503 and 658.504 must be followed.

(c) If it comes to the attention of an ES office or a SWA that an employer participating in the ES may not have complied with the terms of its temporary labor certification, under, for example the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, SWA officials must engage in the procedures for discontinuation of services to employers pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section and simultaneously notify the Chicago National Processing Center (CNPC) of the alleged non-compliance for investigation and consideration of ineligibility pursuant to § 655.184 or § 655.73 of this chapter respectively for subsequent temporary labor certification.
