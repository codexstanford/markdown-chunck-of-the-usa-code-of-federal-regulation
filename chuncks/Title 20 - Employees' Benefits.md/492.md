######## i.e.

The subrogated amount of a specific claim consists of the total money paid by OWCP from the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Fund with respect to that claim to or on behalf of a covered Part B employee, a covered Part E employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary, less charges for any medical file review (, the physician did not examine the employee) done at the request of OWCP. Charges for medical examinations also may be subtracted if the covered Part B employee, covered Part E employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary establishes that the examinations were required to be made available to the covered Part B employee or covered Part E employee under a statute other than EEOICPA.
