###### ยง 416.1140 The presumed value rule.
####### How we determine the amount of your unearned income under the presumed value rule.

(b)(1) If you choose not to question the use of the presumed value, or if the presumed value is less than the actual value of the food or shelter you receive, we use the presumed value to figure your unearned income.

(2) If you show us, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that the presumed value is higher than the actual value of the food or shelter you receive, we use the actual amount to figure your unearned income.
