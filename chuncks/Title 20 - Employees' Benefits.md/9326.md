###### ยง 416.2211 Criteria for determining when VR services will be considered to have contributed to a continuous period of 9 months.
####### Continuous period with medical recovery occurring before completion.

(b)(1) If an individual medically recovers before a continuous period has been completed, VR services under paragraph (a) of this section will not be payable unless some VR services contributed to the medical recovery. VR services will be considered to have contributed to the medical recovery if-

(i) The individualized written rehabilitation program (IWRP), included medical services; and

(ii) The medical recovery occurred, at least in part, because of these medical services. (For example, the individual's medical recovery was based on improvement in a back condition which, at least in part, stemmed from surgery initiated, coordinated or provided under an IWRP).

(2) In some instances, the State VR agency will not have provided, initiated, or coordinated medical services. If this happens, payment for VR services may still be possible under paragraph (a) of this section if:

(i) The medical recovery was not expected by us; and

(ii) The individual's impairment is determined by us to be of such a nature that any medical services provided would not ordinarily have resulted in, or contributed to, the medical cessation.
