##### ยง 404.411 How are benefits reduced for age when a person is entitled to two or more benefits?
###### How is my wife's or husband's benefit reduced when I am entitled to a reduced old-age benefit in the same month?

(d)When a person is first entitled to a wife's or husband's benefit in or after the month of attainment of age 62, that benefit is reduced if, in the first month of entitlement, she or he is also entitled to an old-age benefit (but is not entitled to a disability benefit) to which she or he was first entitled before attainment of full retirement age. Under these circumstances, the wife's or husband's benefit is reduced by the sum of:

(1) The amount by which the old-age benefit would be reduced under the provisions of ยง 404.410; and

(2) The amount by which the spouse benefit would be reduced under the provisions of ยง 404.410 if it were equal to the excess of such benefit (before any reduction for age but after reduction for the family maximum under ยง 404.403) over the individual's own primary insurance amount.
