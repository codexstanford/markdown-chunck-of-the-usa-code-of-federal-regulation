##### ยง 655.736 What are H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators?
###### Employer with borderline H-1B-dependency status.

(2)An employer which uses a "snap-shot" test to determine whether it should undertake a calculation of its H-1B-dependency status (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) is not required to make or maintain any documentation of that "snap-shot" test. The employer's status must be reflected on the LCA(s), which would be available in the public access file. In the event of an enforcement action pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer's records to be made available to the Administrator would enable the employer to show and the Administrator to verify the "snap-shot" test (e.g., copies of H-1B petitions; payroll records described in ยง 655.731(b)(1)) .
