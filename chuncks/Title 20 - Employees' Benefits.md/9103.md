###### General.

(a)We will consider you to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law and you may be eligible for SSI benefits if you are an alien residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure. The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing your departure if it is the policy or practice of that agency not to enforce the departure of aliens in the same category or if from all the facts and circumstances in your case it appears that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is otherwise permitting you to reside in the United States indefinitely. We make these decisions by verifying your status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service following the rules contained in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
