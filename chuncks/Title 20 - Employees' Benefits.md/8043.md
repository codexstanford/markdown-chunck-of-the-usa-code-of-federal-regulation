###### ยง 416.932 When presumptive payments begin and end.

We may make payments to you on the basis of presumptive disability or presumptive blindness before we make a formal determination about your disability or blindness. The payments can not be made for more than 6 months. They start for a period of not more than 6 months beginning in the month we make the presumptive disability or presumptive blindness finding. The payments end the earliest of-

(a) The month in which we make a formal finding on whether or not you are disabled or blind;

(b) The month for which we make the sixth monthly payment based on presumptive disability or presumptive blindness to you; or

(c) The month in which you no longer meet one of the other eligibility requirements (e.g., your income exceeds the limits).
