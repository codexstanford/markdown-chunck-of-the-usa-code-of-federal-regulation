####### Random and selective sampling and case examinations.,i.e.,i.e.

(1)We may use random and selective sampling to identify cases involving any type of action (, fully or partially favorable decisions, unfavorable decisions, or dismissals) and any type of benefits (, benefits based on disability and benefits not based on disability). We will use selective sampling to identify cases that exhibit problematic issues or fact patterns that increase the likelihood of error. Neither our random sampling procedures nor our selective sampling procedures will identify cases based on the identity of the decisionmaker or the identity of the office issuing the decision. We may examine cases that have been identified through random or selective sampling to refine the identification of cases that may meet the criteria for review by the Appeals Council.
