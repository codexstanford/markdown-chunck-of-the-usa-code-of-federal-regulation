####### Use of transfer procedure.

(f)In limited situations, the State may request that reports and payments the State or a political subdivision (but not an individual) erroneously made under FICA procedures and which have been posted to the employee's earnings record be considered made under the State's agreement. We use a transfer procedure to do this. The transfer procedure may be used only where

(1) The periods are open to assessment under the State and local statute of limitations;

(2) The erroneous reports to be transferred are posted to SSA's records;

(3) The periods are barred to refund under the IRS statute of limitations; and

(4) A refund is not obtained from IRS by the reporting entity.
