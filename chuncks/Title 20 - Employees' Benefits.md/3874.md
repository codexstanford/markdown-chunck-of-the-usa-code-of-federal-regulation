##### Correcting the Earnings Record
###### ยง 404.822 Correction of the record of your earnings after the time limit ends.
####### Other circumstances permitting correction,Investigation started before time limit ends.

(e)-(1)We may correct an earnings record if the correction is made as the result of an investigation started before, but completed after the time limit ends. An investigation is started when we take an affirmative step leading to a decision on a question about the earnings record, for example, an investigation is started when one SSA unit asks another unit to obtain additional information or evidence. We will remove or reduce earnings on the record under this paragraph only if we carried out the investigation as promptly as circumstances permitted.
