####### ยง 30.516 Under what circumstances would recovery of an overpayment defeat the purpose of the Act?

Recovery of an overpayment will defeat the purpose of the Act if such recovery would cause hardship to the recipient because:

(a) The recipient from whom OWCP seeks recovery needs substantially all of his or her current income to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses; and

(b) The recipient's assets do not exceed two months' expenditures as determined by OWCP using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey tables.
