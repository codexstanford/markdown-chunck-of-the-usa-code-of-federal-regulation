##### Claim filing-total or part-total unemployment:

A.1. Individuals claiming unemployment compensation for total or part-total unemployment are required to file a claim weekly or biweekly, in person or by mail, at a public employment office or a claims office (these terms include offices at itinerant points) as set forth below.

2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, a claimant is required to file in person: a. His new claim with respect to a benefit year, or his continued claim for a waiting week or for his first compensable week of unemployment in such year; and b. Any other claim, when requested to do so by the claims personnel at the office at which he files his claim(s) because questions about his right to benefits are raised by circumstances such as the following:

(1) The conditions or circumstances of his separation from employment;

(2) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claim(s) indicate that he may be unable to work or that there may be undue restrictions on his availability for work or that his search for work may be inadequate or that he may be disqualified;

(3) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claims create uncertainty about his credibility or indicate a lack of understanding of the applicable requirements; or

(4) The claimant's record shows that he has previously filed a fraudulent claim.

In such circumstances, the claimant is required to continue to file claims in person each week (or biweekly) until the State agency determines that filing claims in person is no longer required for the resolution of such questions.

3. A claimant must be permitted to file a claim by mail in any of the following circumstances: a. He is located in an area requiring the expenditure of an unreasonable amount of time or money in traveling to the nearest facility established by the State agency for filing claims in person; b. Conditions make it impracticable for the agency to take claims in person; c. He has returned to full-time work on or before the scheduled date for his filing a claim, unless the agency makes provision for in-person filing at a time and place that does not interfere with his employment; d. The agency finds that he has good cause for failing to file a claim in person.

4. A claimant who has been receiving benefits for partial unemployment may continue to file claims as if he were a partially unemployed worker for the first four consecutive weeks of total or part-total unemployment immediately following his period of partial unemployment so long as he remains attached to his regular employer.
