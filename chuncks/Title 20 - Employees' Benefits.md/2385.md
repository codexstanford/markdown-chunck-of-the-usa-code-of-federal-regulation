####### Month defined.

(c)(1) For the purposes of this part, if the date prescribed for filing a report or paying a contribution is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or pay the contribution continues shall constitute a month.

(2) If the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution is a date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period that terminates with the date numerically corresponding thereto in the succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall constitute a month. If, in the month of February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for filing the report or paying, the period from such date in January through the last day of February shall constitute a month. Thus, if a report is due on January 30, the first month shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.

(3) If a report is not timely filed or a contribution is not timely paid, the fact that the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution, or the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday is immaterial in determining the number of months.
