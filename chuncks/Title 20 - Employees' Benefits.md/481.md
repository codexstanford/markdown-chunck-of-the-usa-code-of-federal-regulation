####### ยง 30.518 Can OWCP require the recipient of the overpayment to submit additional financial information?

(a) The recipient of the overpayment is responsible for providing information about income, expenses and assets as specified by OWCP. This information is needed to determine whether or not recovery of an overpayment would defeat the purpose of the Act, or would be against equity and good conscience. This information will also be used to determine the repayment schedule, if necessary.

(b) Failure to submit this requested information within 30 days of the request shall result in denial of waiver, and no further request for waiver shall be considered until the requested information is furnished.
