##### ยง 404.413 After my benefits are reduced for age what happens if there is an increase in my primary insurance amount?
###### How are subsequent increases in the primary insurance amount reduced after 1977?

(b)After 1977, when an individual's benefits have been reduced for age and the benefit is increased due to an increase in the primary insurance amount, the amount of the increase to which the individual is entitled is proportionately reduced as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The method of reduction is determined by whether entitlement to reduced benefits began before 1978 or after 1977. When an individual is entitled to more than one benefit which is reduced for age, the rules for reducing the benefit increases apply to each reduced benefit.
