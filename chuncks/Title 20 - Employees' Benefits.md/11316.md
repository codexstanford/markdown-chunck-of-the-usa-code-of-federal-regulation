###### Determinations and repayment.

(a)(1) If a State, the Department, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any person has received any payment under this part to which the person was not entitled, including a payment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, such person is required to repay such amount to the State or the Department, as appropriate, except that the State or the Department must waive such repayment if such State or the Department determines that:

(i) The payment was made without fault on the part of such person; and

(ii) Requiring such repayment would cause a financial hardship for the person (or the person's household, if applicable).

(2) States must provide persons determined to have received TAA overpayments a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for waiver under the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(3) A financial hardship exists if recovery of the overpayment would result in the person's (or the person's household's) loss of or inability to pay for ordinary and necessary living expenses. This determination must take into account the income and resources (including liquid financial resources) reasonably available to the person (and the person's household).

(4) Fault exists for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section if any of the following criteria are met:

(i) Whether a material statement or representation was made by the person or individual in connection with the application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person knew or should have known that the statement or representation was inaccurate;

(ii) Whether the person failed or caused another to fail to disclose a material fact in connection with an application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person knew or should have known that the fact was material;

(iii) Whether the person knew or should have known that the person or individual was not entitled to the TAA payment;

(iv) Whether, for any other reason, the overpayment resulted directly or indirectly, and partially or totally, from any act or omission of the person or of which the person or individual had knowledge, and that was erroneous or inaccurate or otherwise wrong; or

(v) Whether there has been a determination of fraud under paragraph (b) of this section.
