###### ยง 228.18 Reduction for public pension.
####### Exceptions.

(d)The reduction does not apply:

(1) If the survivor is receiving a Government pension based on employment for an interstate instrumentality; or

(2) If the survivor receives or is eligible to receive a Government pension for one or more months in the period December 1977 through November 1982 and he or she meets the requirements for social security benefits that were applied in January 1977, assuming the employee's earnings had been covered under that Act (even though he or she did not actually claim such benefits or become entitled for such benefits until a later month). The January 1977 requirements are, for a man, a one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section), and, for a woman claiming benefits as a surviving divorced spouse, marriage for at least 20 years to the insured worker. A person is considered eligible for a Government pension for any month in which he or she meets all the requirements for payment except that he or she is working or has not applied; or

(3) If a survivor annuitant was receiving or eligible (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) to receive a Government pension for one or more months before July 1983, and he or she meets the one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section). If a survivor annuitant meets the exception in this paragraph but he or she does not meet the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, December 1982 is the earliest month for which the reduction will not affect his benefits; or

(4) If a survivor annuitant was eligible for a Government pension in a given month except for a requirement which delayed eligibility for such pension until the month following the month in which all other requirements were met, the Board will consider the annuitant to be eligible in that given month for the purpose of meeting one of the exceptions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. If an annuitant meets an exception solely because of this paragraph, his or her benefits will be unreduced for months after November 1984 only.
