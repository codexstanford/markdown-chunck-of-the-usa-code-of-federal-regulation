##### ยง 404.411 How are benefits reduced for age when a person is entitled to two or more benefits?
###### How is my wife's or husband's or widow's or widower's benefit reduced when I am entitled to a reduced disability benefit in the same month?

(e)When a person is first entitled to a spouse or widow's or widower's benefit in or after the month of attainment of age 62 (or in the case of widow's or widower's benefits, age 50) that benefit is reduced if, in the first month of entitlement to that benefit, he or she is also entitled to a reduced disability benefit. Under these circumstances, the wife's or husband's or widow's or widower's benefit is reduced by the sum of:

(1) The amount (if any) by which the disability benefit is reduced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and

(2) The amount by which the wife's or husband's or widow's or widower's benefit would be reduced under ยง 404.410 if it were equal to the excess of such benefit (before any reduction for age but after reduction for the family maximum under ยง 404.403) over the disability benefit (before any reduction under paragraph (b) of this section).
