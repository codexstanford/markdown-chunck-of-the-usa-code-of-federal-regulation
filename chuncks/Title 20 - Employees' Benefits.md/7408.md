(b)A person's rights to supplemental security income payments-how much he gets and under what conditions-are clearly defined in the law. The area of administrative discretion is thus limited. If an applicant disagrees with the decision on his claim, he can obtain an administrative review of the decision and if still not satisfied, he may initiate court action.
