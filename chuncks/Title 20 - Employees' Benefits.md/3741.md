####### Filing for lump-sum death payment.

(b)An application for a lump-sum death payment must be filed within 2 years after the death of the person on whose earnings record the claim is filed. There are two exceptions to the 2-year filing requirement:

(1) If there is a good cause for failure to file within the 2-year period, we will consider your application as though it were filed within the 2-year period. Good cause does not exist if you were informed of the need to file an application within the 2-year period and you neglected to do so or did not desire to make a claim. Good cause will be found to exist if you did not file within the time limit due to-

(i) Circumstances beyond your control, such as extended illness, mental or physical incapacity, or a language barrier;

(ii) Incorrect or incomplete information we furnished you;

(iii) Your efforts to get evidence to support your claim without realizing that you could submit the evidence after filing an application; or

(iv) Unusual or unavoidable circumstances which show that you could not reasonably be expected to know of the time limit.

(2) The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 provides for extending the filing time.
