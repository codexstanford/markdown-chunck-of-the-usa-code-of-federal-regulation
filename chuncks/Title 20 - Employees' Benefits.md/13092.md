###### Employee developmental activity.

(i)An H-1B worker who is stationed and regularly works at one location may temporarily be at another location for a particular individual or employer-required developmental activity such as a management conference, a staff seminar, or a formal training course (other than "on-the-job-training" at a location where the employee is stationed and regularly works). For the H-1B worker participating in such activities, the location of the activity would not be considered a "place of employment" or "worksite," and that worker's presence at such location-whether owned or controlled by the employer or by a third party-would not invoke H-1B program requirements with regard to that employee at that location. However, if the employer uses H-1B nonimmigrants as instructors or resource or support staff who continuously or regularly perform their duties at such locations, the locations would be "places of employment" or "worksites" for any such employees and, thus, would be subject to H-1B program requirements with regard to those employees.
