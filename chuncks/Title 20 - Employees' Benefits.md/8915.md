###### § 416.1443 Responsibilities of the adjudication officer.
####### Referral for a hearing.

(4)The adjudication officer will refer the claim to the administrative law judge for further proceedings when the development of evidence is complete, and you or your representative agree that a hearing is ready to be held. If you or your representative are unable to agree with the adjudication officer that the development of evidence is complete, the adjudication officer will note your disagreement and refer the claim to the administrative law judge for further proceedings. At this point, the administrative law judge conducts all further hearing proceedings, including scheduling and holding a hearing, (§ 416.1436), considering any additional evidence or arguments submitted (§§ 416.1435, 416.1444, 416.1449, 416.1450), and issuing a decision or dismissal of your request for a hearing, as may be appropriate (§§ 416.1448, 416.1453, 416.1457). In addition, if the administrative law judge determines on or before the date of your hearing that the development of evidence is not complete, the administrative law judge may return the claim to the adjudication officer to complete the development of the evidence and for such other action as necessary.
