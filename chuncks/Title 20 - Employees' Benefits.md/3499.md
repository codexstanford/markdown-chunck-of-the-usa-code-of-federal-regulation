##### § 404.411 How are benefits reduced for age when a person is entitled to two or more benefits?
###### Individual born before January 2, 1928.

(2)The old-age benefit is reduced if, in the first month of entitlement, she or he is also entitled to a widow's or widower's benefit to which she or he was first entitled for a month before attainment of full retirement age or if, before attainment of full retirement age, she or he met all conditions for entitlement to widow's or widower's benefits in or before the first month for which she or he was entitled to old-age benefits except that the old-age benefit equals or exceeds the primary insurance amount on which the widow's or widower's benefit would be based. Under these circumstances, the old-age benefit is reduced by the larger of the following:

(i) The amount by which the old-age benefit would be reduced under the regular age reduction provisions of § 404.410; or

(ii) An amount equal to the sum of:

(A) The amount by which the widow's or widower's benefit would be reduced under § 404.410 for months prior to age 62; and

(B) The amount by which the old-age benefit would be reduced under § 404.410 if it were equal to the excess of the individual's primary insurance amount over the widow's or widower's benefit before any reduction for age (but after any reduction for the family maximum under § 404.403).
