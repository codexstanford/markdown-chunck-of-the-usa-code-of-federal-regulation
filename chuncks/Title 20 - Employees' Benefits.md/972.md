###### § 217.20 When a written statement is used to establish the filing date.
####### Statement filed with the Board.

(a)A written statement indicating an intent to file a claim for an annuity or lump sum, filed with the Board as provided in §§ 217.15 and 217.16, can establish the filing date of an application. A form set up by the Board to obtain information about persons who may be eligible for an annuity or lump sum in a particular case is not by itself considered a written statement for the purpose of this section. The Board will use the filing date of the written statement if all of the following requirements are met:

(1) The statement gives a person's clear and positive intent to claim an annuity or lump sum for himself or herself or for some other person.

(2) The claimant or a person described in § 217.17 signs the statement.

(3) The person who signed the statement files an application with the Board on one of the forms described in part 200 of this chapter within 90 days after the date a notice is sent advising the person of the need to file an application.

(4) The claimant is alive when the application is filed except as provided in § 217.10.
