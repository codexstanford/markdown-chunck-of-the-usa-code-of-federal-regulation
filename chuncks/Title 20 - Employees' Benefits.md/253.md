####### ยง 10.812 If OWCP reduces a fee, may a provider request reconsideration of the reduction?

(a) A physician or other provider whose charge for service is only partially paid because it exceeds a maximum allowable amount set by the Director may, within 30 days, request reconsideration of the fee determination.

(1) The provider should make such a request to the OWCP district office with jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The request must be accompanied by documentary evidence that the procedure performed was incorrectly identified by the original code, that the presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult, or that the provider possessed unusual qualifications. In itself, board-certification in a specialty is not sufficient evidence of unusual qualifications to justify an exception. These are the only three circumstances which will justify reevaluation of the paid amount.
