##### Blindness
###### § 416.985 How we evaluate other visual impairments.

If you are not blind as defined in the law, we will evaluate a visual impairment the same as we evaluate other impairments in determining disability. Although you will not qualify for benefits on the basis of blindness, you may still be eligible for benefits if we find that you are disabled as defined in §§ 416.905 through 416.907.
