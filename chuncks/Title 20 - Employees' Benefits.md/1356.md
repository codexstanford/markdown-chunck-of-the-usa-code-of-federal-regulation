####### How well the claimant performs.

(b)The Board considers how well the claimant does his or her work when the Board determines whether or not the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity. If the claimant does his or her work satisfactorily, this may show that the claimant is working at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is unable, because of his or her impairments, to do ordinary or simple tasks satisfactorily without more supervision or assistance than is usually given other people doing similar work, this may show that the claimant is not working at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is doing work that involves minimal duties that make little or no demands on the claimant and that are of little or no use to the claimant's railroad or non-railroad employer, or to the operation of a business if the claimant is self-employed, this does not show that the claimant is working at the substantial gainful activity level.
