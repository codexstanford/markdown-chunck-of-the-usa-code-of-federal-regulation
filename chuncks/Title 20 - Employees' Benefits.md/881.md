####### Investment in facilities.

(15)If the worker invests in facilities which are used by the worker in performing services and which are not typically maintained by employees, such as an office rented by the worker from a party unrelated to the worker or to the employer, this factor tends to indicate that the worker is an independent contractor. On the other hand, if all facilities necessary to the work which an individual performs are furnished without charge by the employer, this factor indicates the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Facilities include equipment or premises necessary for the work, other than items such as tools, instruments, and clothing which may be commonly provided by an employee in a particular trade.
