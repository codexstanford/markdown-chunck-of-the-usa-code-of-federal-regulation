##### ยง 404.511 When an individual is at "fault" in a deduction overpayment.
###### Subsequent deduction overpayments.

(b)The Social Security Administration generally will not find an individual to be without fault where, after having been exonerated for a "deduction overpayment" and after having been advised of the correct interpretation of the deduction provision, the individual incurs another "deduction overpayment" under the same circumstances as the first overpayment. However, in determining whether the individual is without fault, the Social Security Administration will consider all of the pertinent circumstances surrounding the prior and subsequent "deduction overpayments," including any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which the individual may have.
