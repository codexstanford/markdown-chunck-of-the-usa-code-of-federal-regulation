##### Subpart C - Eligibility Criteria
###### Eligibility Criteria for Certain Uranium Employees Under Part B of EEOICPA
####### ยง 30.226 How does a claimant establish that a covered uranium employee has sustained a consequential injury, illness, impairment or disease?

An injury, illness, impairment or disease sustained as a consequence of a medical condition covered by the provisions of ยง 30.225(a) must be established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or disease and the accepted medical condition. Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disease manifests itself after a diagnosis of a medical condition covered by the provisions of ยง 30.225(a), nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disease was caused by such a condition, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.
