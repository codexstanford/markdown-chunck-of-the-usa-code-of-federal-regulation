###### Waiver.

(g)(1) We will waive the collection of interest and administrative costs imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. Excepting debt affected by fraud or other misconduct, we may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis if we determine that such action is in the best interest of the Government or is otherwise warranted by equity and good conscience.

(2) We may waive interest, penalties, and administrative charges charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, based on:

(i) The criteria set forth at ยง 422.846 (b)(1) for the compromise of debts; or

(ii) A determination by the agency that collection of these charges is:

(A) Against equity and good conscience; or

(B) Not in the best interest of the United States.
