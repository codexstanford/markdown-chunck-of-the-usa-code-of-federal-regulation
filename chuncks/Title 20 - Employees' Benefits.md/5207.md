###### Scotoma.

h.A scotoma is a field defect or non-seeing area (also referred to as a "blind spot") in the visual field surrounded by a normal field or seeing area. When we measure your visual field, we subtract the length of any scotoma, other than the normal blind spot, from the overall length of any diameter on which it falls.
