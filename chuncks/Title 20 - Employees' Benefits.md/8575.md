###### ยง 416.1165 How we deem income to you from your ineligible parent(s).
####### Eligible parent becomes ineligible.

(2)If your eligible parent becomes ineligible, we deem your parents' income to you in the first month of the parents' ineligibility to determine whether you continue to be eligible for SSI benefits. However, if you continue to be eligible, in order to determine your benefit amount, we follow the regular rule of counting your income in the second month prior to the current month.
