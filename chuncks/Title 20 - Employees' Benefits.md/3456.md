(h)(1) For an explanation of when a reduction is made under this section where other reductions, deductions, etc., are involved, see ยง 404.402.

(2) Whenever a reduction in the total of benefits for any month based on an individual's earnings record is made under paragraph (a) of this section, each benefit, except the disability insurance benefit, is first proportionately decreased. Any excess reduction over the sum of all the benefits, other than the disability insurance benefit, is then applied to the disability insurance benefit.
