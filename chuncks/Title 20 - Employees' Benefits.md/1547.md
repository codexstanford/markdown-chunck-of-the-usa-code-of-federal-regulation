(4)The Board will apply the state law where the employee was domiciled when he or she died. The Board will apply the version of state law in effect at the time of the final decision on the application for benefits. If under that version of state law the claimant does not qualify as the child of the employee, the Board will apply the state law in effect when the employee died, or any version of state law in effect from the month of potential entitlement to benefits until a final determination on the application. The Board will apply the version most beneficial to the claimant. The following rules determine the law in effect as of the employee's death:

(i) Any law enacted after the employee's death, if that law would have retroactive application to the employee's date of death, will apply; or

(ii) Any law that supersedes a law declared unconstitutional, that was considered constitutional on the employee's date of death, will apply.
