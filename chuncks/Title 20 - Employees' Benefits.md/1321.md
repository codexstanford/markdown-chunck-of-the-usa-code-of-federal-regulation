(a)The Board considers that work exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where the claimant lives or in several other regions of the country. It does not matter whether-

(2) A specific job vacancy exists for the claimant; or

(3) The claimant would be hired if the claimant applied for work.
