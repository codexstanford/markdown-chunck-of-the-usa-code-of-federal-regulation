####### Adjustment of contributions.

(c)(1) All adjustments of contributions based on compensation adjustments shall be accounted for by the employer on the contribution report for the same quarter in which the Form BA-4 reflecting the compensation adjustments is filed with the Board.

(2) If less than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by-

(i) Reporting the additional contribution on the next report filed after discovery of the error; and

(ii) Paying the amount thereof to the Board at the time such report is filed.

(3) If more than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by applying the excess payment as a credit against the contribution due on the next report filed after discovery of the error. However, if the overpayment cannot be adjusted because the employer is no longer required to file a report or because the overpayment to be adjusted exceeds the amount of contribution due on the employer's next report, the employer may file for a refund of the amount which cannot be adjusted as provided for in this section. If the overpayment is the result of an incorrect contribution rate as determined by the Board, the employer may file for a refund of the amount of overpayment or may take an adjustment as provided for in this section.
