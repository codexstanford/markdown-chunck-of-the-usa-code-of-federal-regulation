####### Initial contribution rate.

(b)The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in calendar months before the end of the first full calendar year that the employer is subject to this section shall be the average contribution rate paid by all employers during the three calendar years preceding the calendar year before the calendar year in which the compensation is paid. The Board will compute the average contribution rate by dividing the aggregate contributions paid by all employers during those three calendar years by the aggregate compensation with respect to which such contributions were paid and by then multiplying the resulting ratio, as computed to four decimal points, by 100.
