###### Receipts from the sale, exchange, or replacement of a resource.

(e)If an individual sells, exchanges or replaces a resource, the receipts are not income. They are still considered to be a resource. This rule includes resources that have never been counted as such because they were sold, exchanged or replaced in the month in which they were received. See ยง 416.1246 for the rule on resources disposed of for less than fair market value (including those disposed of during the month of receipt).
