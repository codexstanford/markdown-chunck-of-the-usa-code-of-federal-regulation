##### ยง 641.720 How will the Department and grantees initially determine and then adjust expected levels of the core performance measures?
###### First 2 years.

(a)Before the beginning of the first program year of the grant, each grantee must reach agreement with the Department on levels of performance for each measure listed in ยง 641.700 for each of the first 2 program years covered by the grant agreement. In reaching the agreement, the grantee and the Department must take into account the expected levels of performance proposed by the grantee and the factors described in paragraph (c) of this section.

The levels agreed to will be considered the expected levels of performance for the grantee for such program years. Funds may not be awarded under the grant until such agreement is reached. At the conclusion of negotiations concerning the performance levels with all grantees, the Department will make available for public review the final negotiated expected levels of performance for each grantee, including any comments submitted by the grantee regarding the grantee's satisfaction with the negotiated levels.
