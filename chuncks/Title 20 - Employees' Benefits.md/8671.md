##### ยง 416.1224 How nonbusiness property used to produce goods or services essential to self-support is counted.

Nonbusiness property is considered to be essential for an individual's (and spouse, if any) self-support if it is used to produce goods or services necessary for his or her daily activities. This type of property includes real property such as land which is used to produce vegetables or livestock only for personal consumption in the individual's household (for example, corn, tomatoes, chicken, cattle). This type of property also includes personal property necessary to perform daily functions exclusive of passenger cars, trucks, boats, or other special vehicles. (See ยง 416.1218 for a discussion on how automobiles are counted.) Property used to produce goods or services or property necessary to perform daily functions is excluded if the individual's equity in the property does not exceed $6,000. Personal property which is required by the individual's employer for work is not counted, regardless of value, while the individual is employed. Examples of this type of personal property include tools, safety equipment, uniforms and similar items.
