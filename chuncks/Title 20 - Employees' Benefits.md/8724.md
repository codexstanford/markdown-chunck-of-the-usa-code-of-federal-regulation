###### Uncompensated value-General.

(d)(1)The uncompensated value is the fair market value of a resource at the time of transfer minus the amount of compensation received by the individual (or eligible spouse) in exchange for the resource. However, if the transferred resource was partially excluded, we will not count uncompensated value in an amount greater than the countable value of the resources at the time of transfer.
