###### ยง 416.1166a How we deem income to you from your sponsor if you are an alien.

Before we deem your sponsor's income to you if you are an alien, we determine how much earned and unearned income your sponsor has under ยง 416.1161(b). We then deduct allocations for the sponsor and the sponsor's dependents. This is an amount equal to the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the sponsor (or for each sponsor even if two sponsors are married to each other and living together) plus an amount equal to one-half the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual for each dependent of the sponsor. An ineligible dependent's income is not subtracted from the sponsor's dependent's allocation. We deem the balance of the income to be your unearned income.
