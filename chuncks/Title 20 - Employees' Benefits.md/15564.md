(2) Employeesuffers a covered workplace injury and dies on December 1, 2012. She has one eligible survivor and her average weekly wage was $300.00. Becauseaverage weekly wage of $300.00 falls below the FY 2013 national average weekly wage of $662.59, death benefits are calculated at 50% of that national average wage (33 U.S.C. 909(e)). This yields a calculated compensation rate of $331.30. But because this rate exceedsactual average weekly wages, weekly death benefits payable during FY 2013 are limited to $300.00. In FY 2014,survivor is entitled to a 1.62% section 10(f) adjustment, resulting in weekly death benefits of $305.00 ($300.00 x .0162 = $4.86; $300.00 + $4.86 = $304.86, rounded to the nearest dollar).survivor would continue to receive section 10(f) adjustments in subsequent fiscal years.
