###### ยง 416.203 Initial determinations of SSI eligibility.
####### How we determine your eligibility for SSI benefits.

(b)We determine that you are eligible for SSI benefits for a given month if you meet the requirements in ยง 416.202 in that month. However, you cannot become eligible for payment of SSI benefits until the month after the month in which you first become eligible for SSI benefits (see ยง 416.501). In addition, we usually determine the amount of your SSI benefits for a month based on your income in an earlier month (see ยง 416.420). Thus, it is possible for you to meet the eligibility requirements in a given month but receive no benefit payment for that month.
