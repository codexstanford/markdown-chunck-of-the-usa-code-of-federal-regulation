##### ยง 655.738 What are the "non-displacement of U.S. workers" obligations that apply to H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators, and how do they operate?
###### Which U.S. workers are protected against "direct displacement"?

(1)This prohibition covers the H-1B employer's own workforce-U.S. workers "employed by the employer"-who are employed in jobs that are essentially equivalent to the jobs for which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) are sought (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). The term "employed by the employer" is defined in ยง 655.715.
