###### ยง 416.925 Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter.
####### marked,extreme

(ii) Although the severity criteria in part B of the listings are expressed in different ways for different impairments, "listing-level severity" generally means the level of severity described in ยง 416.926a(a); that is, "marked" limitations in two domains of functioning or an "extreme" limitation in one domain. (See ยง 416.926a(e) for the definitions of the termsandas they apply to children.) Therefore, in general, a child's impairment(s) is of "listing-level severity" if it causes marked limitations in two domains of functioning or an extreme limitation in one. However, when we decide whether your impairment(s) meets the requirements of a listing, we will decide that your impairment is of "listing-level severity" even if it does not result in marked limitations in two domains of functioning, or an extreme limitation in one, if the listing that we apply does not require such limitations to establish that an impairment(s) is disabling.
