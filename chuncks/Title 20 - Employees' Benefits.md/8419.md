###### ยง 416.1102 What is income?

Income is anything you receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet your needs for food and shelter. Sometimes income also includes more or less than you actually receive (see ยง 416.1110 and ยง 416.1123(b)). In-kind income is not cash, but is actually food or shelter, or something you can use to get one of these.
