####### What the rule is.

(a)Instead of determining the actual dollar value of in-kind support and maintenance, we count one-third of the Federal benefit rate as additional income if you (or you and your eligible spouse)-

(1) Live in another person's household (see ยง 416.1132) for a full calendar month except for temporary absences (see ยง 416.1149), and

(2) Receive both food and shelter from the person in whose household you are living. (If you do not receive both food and shelter from this person, see ยง 416.1140.)
