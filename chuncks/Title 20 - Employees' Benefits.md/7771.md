## Chapter III - Social Security Administration
### PART 416 - SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FOR THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLED
#### Subpart I - Determining Disability and Blindness
##### General
###### § 416.902 Definitions for this subpart.
####### Marked and severe functional limitations,

(h)when used as a phrase, means the standard of disability in the Social Security Act for children claiming SSI benefits based on disability. It is a level of severity that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the listings. (See §§ 416.906, 416.924, and 416.926a.) The words "marked" and "severe" are also separate terms used throughout this subpart to describe measures of functional limitations; the term "marked" is also used in the listings. (See §§ 416.924 and 416.926a.) The meaning of the words "marked" and "severe" when used as part of the phrase marked and severe functional limitations is not the same as the meaning of the separate terms "marked" and "severe" used elsewhere in 404 and 416. (See §§ 416.924(c) and 416.926a(e).)
