###### ยง 418.1330 Can you request a reconsideration when you believe that the IRS information we used is incorrect?

If you request a reconsideration solely because you believe that the information that IRS gave us is incorrect, we will dismiss your request for a reconsideration and notify you to obtain proof of a correction from IRS and request a new initial determination (ยง 418.1335). Our dismissal of your request for reconsideration is not an initial determination subject to further administrative or judicial review.
