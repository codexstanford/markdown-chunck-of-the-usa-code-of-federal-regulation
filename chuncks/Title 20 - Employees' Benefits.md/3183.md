##### Old-Start Method of Computing Primary Insurance Amounts
###### ยง 404.241 1977 simplified old-start method.
####### Old-start computation formula.

(e)We use the following formula to compute your primary insurance benefit, which we will convert to your primary insurance amount:

(1) We take 40 percent of the first $50 of your average monthly wage, plus 10 percent of the next $200 of your average monthly wage up to a total average monthly wage of $250. (We do not use more than $250 of your average monthly wage.)

(2) We increase the amount found in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by 1 percent for each $1,650 in your pre-1951 earnings, disregarding any remainder less than $1,650. We always increase the amount by at least 4 of these 1 percent increments but may not increase it by more than 14 of them.
