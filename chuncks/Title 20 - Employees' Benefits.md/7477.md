##### Reasons Why You May Not Get SSI Benefits for Which You Are Otherwise Eligible
###### ยง 416.211 You are a resident of a public institution.
####### Exception for residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless.

(d)For months after December 1987, if you are a resident of a public emergency shelter for the homeless (defined in ยง 416.201) you may be eligible for SSI benefits for any 6 months throughout which you reside in a shelter in any 9-month period (defined in ยง 416.201). The 6 months do not need to be consecutive and we will not count as part of the 6 months any prior months throughout which you lived in the shelter but did not receive SSI benefits. We will also not count any months throughout which you lived in the shelter and received SSI benefits prior to January 1988.
