(b) The grandchild began living with the employee before the grandchild attained age 18.

(c) The grandchild is living with the employee in the United States and receives at least one-half of his or her support from the employee for the year before the month in which-

(1) The employee's annuity was increased under the social security overall minimum provision by including the grandchild; or

(2) The employee could become entitled to a social security benefit as described above; or

(3) The employee becomes entitled to a period of disability which continues until he or she could become entitled to a social security benefit as described above.

(d) In the case of a grandchild born within the one-year period referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, at the close of such period the child must have been living with and have been receiving at least one-half of his or her support from the employee for substantially all of the period that began on the date the grandchild was born. "Substantially all" is defined in ยง 222.53.
