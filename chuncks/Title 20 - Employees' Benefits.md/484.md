(b) When an overpayment has been made to a recipient and OWCP is unable to recover the overpayment by reducing compensation due currently, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention is called to same. The overpayment is subject to the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701), and may be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as income. If the recipient fails to make such refund, OWCP may recover the overpayment through any available means, including offset of salary, annuity benefits, or other Federal payments, including tax refunds as authorized by the Tax Refund Offset Program, or referral of the debt to a collection agency or to the Department of Justice.
