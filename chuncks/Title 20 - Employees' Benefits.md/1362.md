####### The Board considers only the amount the claimant earns.

(2)The Board does not consider any income not directly related to the claimant's productivity when the Board decides whether the claimant has done substantial gainful activity. If the claimant's earnings are subsidized, the amount of the subsidy is not counted when the Board determines whether or not the claimant's work is substantial gainful activity. Thus, where work is done under special conditions, the Board only considers the part of the claimant's pay which the claimant actually "earns." For example, where a handicapped person does simple tasks under close and continuous supervision, the Board would not determine that the person worked at the substantial gainful activity level only on the basis of the amount of pay. A railroad or non-railroad employer may set a specific amount as a subsidy after figuring the reasonable value of the employee's services. If the claimant's work is subsidized and the claimant's railroad and non-railroad employer does not set the amount of the subsidy or does not adequately explain how the subsidy was figured, the Board will investigate to see how much the claimant's work is worth.
