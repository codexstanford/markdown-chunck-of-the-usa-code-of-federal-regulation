#### Appendix A to Part 602 - Standard for Claim Determinations - Separation Information
##### Disqualification or ineligibility.

h.If a disqualification is imposed, or if the claimant is declared ineligible for one or more weeks, he must be given not only a statement of the period of disqualification or ineligibility and the amount of wage-credit reductions, if any, but also an explanation of the reason for the ineligibility or disqualification. This explanation must be sufficiently detailed so that he will understand why he is ineligible or why he has been disqualified, and what he must do in order to requalify for benefits or purge the disqualification. The statement must be individualized to indicate the facts upon which the determination was based, e.g., state, "It is found that you left your work with Blank Company because you were tired of working; the separation was voluntary, and the reason does not constitute good cause," rather than merely the phrase "voluntary quit." Checking a box as to the reason for the disqualification is not a sufficiently detailed explanation. However, this statement of the reason for the disqualification need not be a restatement of all facts considered in arriving at the determination.
