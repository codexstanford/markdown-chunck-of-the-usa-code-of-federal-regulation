####### If the claimant is working in a sheltered or special environment.

(3)If the claimant is working in a sheltered workshop, the claimant may or may not be earning the amounts he or she is being paid. The fact that the sheltered workshop or similar facility is operating at a loss or is receiving some charitable contributions or governmental aid does not establish that the claimant is not earning all he or she is being paid. Since persons in military service being treated for a severe impairment usually continue to receive full pay, the Board evaluates work activity in a therapy program or while on limited duty by comparing it with similar work in the civilian work force or on the basis of reasonable worth of the work, rather than on the actual amount of the earnings.
