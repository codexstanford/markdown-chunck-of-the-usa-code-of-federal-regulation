##### Subpart C - Determining Entitlement to Benefits
###### ยง 718.204 Total disability and disability causation defined; criteria for determining total disability and total disability due to pneumoconiosis.
####### Total disability due to pneumoconiosis defined.

(c)(1)A miner shall be considered totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if pneumoconiosis, as defined in ยง 718.201, is a substantially contributing cause of the miner's totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. Pneumoconiosis is a "substantially contributing cause" of the miner's disability if it:

(i) Has a material adverse effect on the miner's respiratory or pulmonary condition; or

(ii) Materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment.

(2) Except as provided in ยง 718.305 and paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, proof that the miner suffers or suffered from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iv) and (d) of this section shall not, by itself, be sufficient to establish that the miner's impairment is or was due to pneumoconiosis. Except as provided in paragraph (d), the cause or causes of a miner's total disability shall be established by means of a physician's documented and reasoned medical report.
