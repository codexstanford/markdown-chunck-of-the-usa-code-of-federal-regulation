###### ยง 416.1168 How we deem income to you from your essential person.
####### Essential person's income.

(a)If you have an essential person, we deem all of that person's income (except any not counted because of other Federal statutes as described in ยง 416.1161(b)) to be your own unearned income. If your essential person is also your ineligible spouse, or if you are a child whose essential person is your ineligible parent, we apply the essential person deeming rules in this section. See ยง 416.1169 for the rules that apply when an ineligible spouse or parent ceases to be your essential person.
