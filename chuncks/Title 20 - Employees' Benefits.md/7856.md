####### Your impairment(s) must prevent you from doing your past relevant work.

(f)If we cannot make a determination or decision at the first three steps of the sequential evaluation process, we will compare our residual functional capacity assessment, which we made under paragraph (e) of this section, with the physical and mental demands of your past relevant work. See paragraph (h) of this section and ยง 416.960(b). If you can still do this kind of work, we will find that you are not disabled.
