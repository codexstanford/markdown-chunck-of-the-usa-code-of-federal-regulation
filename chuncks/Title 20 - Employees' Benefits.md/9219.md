###### Living arrangements.

(2)In addition, a State may elect up to six variations in recognition of the different needs which result from various living arrangements. If a State elects six payment level variations based on differences in living arrangements, one of these six variations must apply only to individuals in Medicaid facilities, that is, facilities receiving title XIX payments with respect to such persons for the cost of their care (see ยง 416.211(b)(1)). In any event, States are limited to one payment level variation for residents of Medicaid facilities. Types of other living arrangements for which payment variations may be allowed include arrangements such as:

(i) Living alone;

(ii) Living with an ineligible spouse;

(iii) Personal care facility; or,

(iv) Domiciliary or congregate care facility.
