####### Allocating downpayments.

(3)If the claimant makes a downpayment, the Board will, if the claimant chooses, make a separate calculation for the downpayment in order to provide for uniform monthly deductions. In these situations the Board will determine the total payment that the claimant will make over a 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the downpayment and allocate that amount over the 12 months. Beginning with the 13th month, the regular monthly payment will be deductible. This allocation process will be for a shorter period if the claimant's regular monthly payments will extend over a period of less than 12 months.
