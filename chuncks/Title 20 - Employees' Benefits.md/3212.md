###### ยง 404.273 When are automatic cost-of-living increases effective?
####### see

We make automatic cost-of-living increases if the applicable index, either the CPI or the AWI, rises over a specified measuring period (the rules on measuring periods in ยง 404.274). If the cost-of-living increase is to be based on an increase in the CPI, the increase is effective in December of the year in which the measuring period ends. If the increase is to be based on an increase in the AWI, the increase is effective in December of the year after the year in which the measuring period ends.
