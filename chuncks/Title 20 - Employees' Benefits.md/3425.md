## Chapter III - Social Security Administration
### PART 404 - FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950- )
#### Subpart E - Deductions; Reductions; and Nonpayments of Benefits
##### ยง 404.403 Reduction where total monthly benefits exceed maximum family benefits payable.
###### Entitled to disability insurance benefits after June 1980.

(d-1)If you first become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits after 1978 and first entitled to disability insurance benefits after June 1980, we compute the monthly family maximum under a formula which is different from that in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The computation under the new formula is as follows:

(1) We take 85 percent of your average indexed monthly earnings and compare that figure with your primary insurance amount (see ยง 404.212 of this part). We work with the larger of these two amounts.

(2) We take 150 percent of your primary insurance amount.

(3) We compare the results of paragraphs (d-1) (1) and (2) of this section. The smaller amount is the monthly family maximum. As a result of this rule, the entitled spouse and children of some workers will not be paid any benefits because the family maximum does not exceed the primary insurance amount.
