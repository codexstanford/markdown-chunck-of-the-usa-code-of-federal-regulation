####### ยง 725.232 Member of the same household - "living with," "living in the same household," and "living in the miner's household," defined.
######## Temporary absence.

(b)The temporary absence from the same residence of either the miner, or the miner's spouse, parent, brother, or sister (as the case may be), does not preclude a finding that one was "living with" the other, or that they were "members of the same household." The absence of one such individual from the residence in which both had customarily lived shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be considered temporary:

(1) If such absence was due to service in the Armed Forces of the United States; or

(2) If the period of absence from his or her residence did not exceed 6 months and the absence was due to business or employment reasons, or because of confinement in a penal institution or in a hospital, nursing home, or other curative institution; or

(3) In any other case, if the evidence establishes that despite such absence they nevertheless reasonably expected to resume physically living together.
