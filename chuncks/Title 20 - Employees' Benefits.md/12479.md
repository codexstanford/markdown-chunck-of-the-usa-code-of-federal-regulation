###### Amount of the bond.

(2)Unless a higher amount is sought by the WHD Administrator pursuant to 29 CFR 501.9(a), the required bond amount is the base amount adjusted to reflect the average AEWR, as defined in ยง 655.103, and further adjusted if the labor certification will be used for the employment of 150 or more workers.

(i) The base amounts are $5,000 for a labor certification for which an H-2ALC employs fewer than 25 workers; $10,000 for a labor certification for which an H-2ALC employs 25 to 49 workers; $20,000 for a labor certification for which an H-2ALC employs 50 to 74 workers; $50,000 for a labor certification for which an H-2ALC employs 75 to 99 workers; and $75,000 for a labor certification for which an H-2ALC employs 100 or more workers.

(ii) The bond amount is calculated by multiplying the base amount by the average AEWR in effect at the time of bond submission, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and dividing by $9.25. Thus, the required bond amounts will vary based on changes in the average AEWR.
