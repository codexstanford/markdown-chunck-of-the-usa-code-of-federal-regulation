###### ยง 404.1591 If your medical recovery was expected and you returned to work.

If your impairment was expected to improve and you returned to full-time work with no significant medical limitations and acknowledge that medical improvement has occurred, we may find that your disability ended in the month you returned to work. Unless there is evidence showing that your disability has not ended, we will use the medical and other evidence already in your file and the fact that you returned to full-time work without significant limitations to determine that you are no longer disabled. (If your impairment is not expected to improve, we will not ordinarily review your claim until the end of the trial work period, as described in ยง 404.1592.)
