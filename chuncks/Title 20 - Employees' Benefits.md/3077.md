###### ยง 404.130 How we determine disability insured status.
####### General.

(a)We have four different rules for determining if you are insured for purposes of establishing a period of disability or becoming entitled to disability insurance benefits. To have disability insured status, you must meet one of these rules and you must be fully insured (see ยง 404.132 which tells when the period ends for determining the number of quarters of coverage (QCs) you need to be fully insured).
