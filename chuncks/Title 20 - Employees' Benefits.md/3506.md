##### ยง 404.413 After my benefits are reduced for age what happens if there is an increase in my primary insurance amount?
###### How is the reduction computed for increases after 1977?,Entitlement to reduced benefits after 1977.

(c)-(1)If an individual becomes entitled after 1977 to a benefit reduced for age, and the primary insurance amount on which the reduced benefit is based is increased, the amount of the increase payable to the individual is reduced by the same percentage as we use to reduce the benefit in the month of initial entitlement. Where the reduced benefit of an individual has been adjusted at full retirement age (age 62 and full retirement age for widows or widowers), any increase to which the individual becomes entitled thereafter is reduced by the adjusted percentage.
