####### Components of an experience-rated contribution rate.

(b)An employer's experience-rated contribution rate for each calendar year beginning with 1993 will be based upon the following charges:

(1) An allocated charge based upon the amount of benefits paid to employees of such employer; this charge is explained in subpart E of this part;

(2) An unallocated charge based upon a proportionate share of the system unallocated charge balance, the computation of which is explained in ยง 345.302(p) of this part;

(3) A pooled charge, also referred to as risk-sharing, to cover the cost of benefit payments that are chargeable to a base year employer but are not captured by the contribution rate assigned to such employer because it is paying contributions at the maximum rate of contribution; the formula for computing the pooled charge is set forth in ยง 345.302(j) of this part;

(4) A surcharge of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent, or a pooled credit, depending on the balance to the credit of the Account as of June 30 of a given year; and

(5) An addition of 0.65 percent to the rate of contribution to cover the expenses incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA.
