###### ยง 220.144 Evaluation guides for a self-employed claimant.
####### If the claimant is a self-employed claimant.

(a)The Board will consider the claimant's activities and their value to the claimant's business to decide whether the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity if the claimant is self-employed. The Board will not consider the claimant's income alone since the amount of income the claimant actually receives may depend upon a number of different factors like capital investment, profit sharing agreements, etc. The Board will generally consider work that the claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's income from that work will not show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity. The Board will evaluate the claimant's work activity on the value to the business of the claimant's services regardless of whether the claimant receives an immediate income for his or her services. The Board considers that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity if-

(1) The claimant's work activity, in terms of factors such as hours, skills, energy output, efficency, duties, and responsibilities, is comparable to that of unimpaired persons in the claimant's community who are in the same or similar businesses as their means of livelihood;

(2) The claimant's work activity, although not comparable to that of unimpaired persons, is clearly worth the amount shown in ยง 220.143(b)(2) when considered in terms of its value to the business, or when compared to the salary that an owner would pay to an employed person to do the work the claimant is doing; or

(3) The claimant renders services that are significant to the operation of the business and receives a substantial income from the business.
