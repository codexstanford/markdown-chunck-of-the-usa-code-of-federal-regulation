####### Payment by hour, week, month.

(12)Payment at a fixed rate per hour, week, or month indicates that an individual is an employee. Payment by commission with a guaranteed minimum salary, or by a drawing account at stated intervals with no requirement to repay amounts which exceed the individual's earnings, also indicates that an individual is an employee. Payment in a lump sum for a completed job indicates that an individual is self-employed. The lump sum may be computed by the number of hours required to do the job at a fixed hourly rate, or by weekly or monthly installments toward a lump sum agreed upon in advance as the total cost. Payment made on a straight commission basis generally indicates that the worker is an independent contractor.
