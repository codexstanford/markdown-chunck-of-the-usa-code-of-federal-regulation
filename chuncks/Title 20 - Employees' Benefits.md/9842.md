##### ยง 422.824 Non-centralized administrative offset.

(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized Administrative Offset under ยง 422.825 is not available or appropriate, we may collect a past due, legally enforceable, nontax delinquent debt by conducting non-centralized Administrative Offset internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Generally, non-centralized Administrative Offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that an agency conducts at its own discretion, internally or in cooperation with a second agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. In these cases, we may make a request directly to a payment-authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. We adopt the procedures in 31 CFR 901.3(c) so that we may request the Department of the Treasury or any other payment-authorizing agency to conduct a non-centralized Administrative Offset.

(b) Administrative Offset may be initiated only after:

(1) The debtor has been sent a notice of the type and amount of the debt, the intention to initiate Administrative Offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; and

(2) The debtor has been given:

(i) The opportunity to review and copy records related to the debt;

(ii) The opportunity for a review within the department of the determination of indebtedness; and

(iii) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

(c) The agency may omit the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section when:
