(1) If you reached age 62 after 1978 and before 1984, we may recompute to include earnings for years before the year you reached age 62 by using the guaranteed alternative (ยง 404.231). We will increase the result by any cost-of-living orincreases in the primary insurance amounts that have become effective in and after the year you reached age 62.

(2) We will also recompute under the old-start guarantee (ยง 404.242) and the prior-disability guarantee (ยง 404.252) if you meet the requirements of either or both these methods.
