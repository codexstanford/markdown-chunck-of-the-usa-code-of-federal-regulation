The State will insure that all employees have an acceptable level of competence. We will provide training and other instructional materials to facilitate basic and advanced technical proficiency of disability staff in order to insure uniformity and effectiveness in the administration of the disability program. We will conduct or specify training, as appropriate, but only if:

(a) A State agency's performance approaches unacceptable levels; or

(b) The material required for the training is complex or the capacity of the State to deliver the training is in doubt and uniformity of the training is essential.
