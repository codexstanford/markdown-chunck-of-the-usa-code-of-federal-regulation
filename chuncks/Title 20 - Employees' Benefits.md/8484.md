###### ยง 416.1140 The presumed value rule.
####### How we apply the presumed value rule.

(a)(1) When you receive in-kind support and maintenance and the one-third reduction rule does not apply, we use the presumed value rule. Instead of determining the actual dollar value of any food or shelter you receive, we presume that it is worth a maximum value. This maximum value is one-third of your Federal benefit rate plus the amount of the general income exclusion described in ยง 416.1124(c)(12).

(2) The presumed value rule allows you to show that your in-kind support and maintenance is not equal to the presumed value. We will not use the presumed value if you show us that-

(i) The current market value of any food or shelter you receive, minus any payment you make for them, is lower than the presumed value; or

(ii) The actual amount someone else pays for your food or shelter is lower than the presumed value.
