##### ยง 655.739 What is the "recruitment of U.S. workers" obligation that applies to H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators, and how does it operate?
###### i.e.,

An employer that is subject to this additional attestation obligation (under the standards described in ยง 655.736) is required-prior to filing the LCA or any petition or request for extension of status supported by the LCA-to take good faith steps to recruit U. S. workers in the United States for the job(s) in the United States for which the H-1B nonimmigrant(s) is/are sought. The recruitment shall use procedures that meet industry-wide standards and offer compensation that is at least as great as the required wage to be paid to H-1B nonimmigrants pursuant to ยง 655.731(a) (the higher of the local prevailing wage or the employer's actual wage). The employer may use legitimate selection criteria relevant to the job that are normal or customary to the type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a discriminatory manner. This section provides guidance for the employer's compliance with the recruitment obligation.
