###### Monthly compensation base.

The term "monthly compensation base" means the greater of $600, or the amount calculated using the following formula:

For the purpose of this formula, "MCB" is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation base, and "A" is the amount of the Tier I tax base under section 3231(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code for the calendar year for which the monthly compensation base is being computed. If the dollar amount computed under this formula is not a multiple of $5, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $5. If the dollar amount computed is equidistant between two multiples of $5, it shall be rounded up the nearest multiple of $5.
