##### ยง 655.738 What are the "non-displacement of U.S. workers" obligations that apply to H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators, and how do they operate?
###### Which U.S. workers are protected against "secondary displacement"?

(1)This provision applies to U.S. workers employed by the other or "secondary" employer (not those employed by the H-1B employer) in jobs that are essentially equivalent to the jobs for which certain H-1B nonimmigrants are placed with the other/secondary employer (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). The term "employed by the employer" is defined in ยง 655.715.
