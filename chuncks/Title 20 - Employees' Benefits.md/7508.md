##### Special Provisions for People Who Work Despite a Disabling Impairment
###### ยง 416.267 General.

We determine whether the special SSI eligibility status applies to you by verifying that you continue to be blind or have a disabling impairment by applying the rules in subpart I of this part, and by following the rules in this subpart to determine whether you meet the requirements in ยง 416.265(b). If you do not meet these requirements we determine that the special eligibility status does not apply. If you meet these requirements, then we apply special rules to determine if you meet the requirements of ยง 416.265 (c) and (d). If for the period being evaluated, you meet all of the requirements in ยง 416.265 we determine that the special status applies to you.
