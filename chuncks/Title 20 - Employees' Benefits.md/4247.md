(d)Wages are not deemed under this section-

(1) For any period before the quarter in which the individual attained age 18; or

(2) If a larger benefit is payable without the deemed wages; or

(3) If a benefit based in whole or in part upon internment is determined by any agency of the United States to be payable under any other law of the United States or under a system set up by that agency. However, this exception does not apply in cases where the failure to receive deemed wages reduces the primary insurance amount by 50 cents or less.
