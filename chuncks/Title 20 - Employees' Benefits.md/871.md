####### Hiring, supervising, and payment of assistants.

(5)An employer generally hires, supervises, and pays assistants. An individual who hires, supervises, and pays other workers at the direction of the employer may be an employee acting as a representative of the employer. However, if an individual hires, supervises, and pays his or her own assistants pursuant to a contract under which the individual agrees to provide materials and labor and under which the individual is responsible only for the attainment of a result, this factor indicates an independent contractor status.
