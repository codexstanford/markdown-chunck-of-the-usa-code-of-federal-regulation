###### Evidence of Wage-Loss
####### ยง 30.806 What kind of medical evidence must the claimant submit to prove that he or she lost wages due to a covered illness?
######## i.e.,

OWCP requires the submission of rationalized medical evidence of sufficient probative value to convince the fact-finder that the covered Part E employee experienced a loss in wages in his or her trigger month due to a covered illness,medical evidence based on a physician's fully explained and reasoned decision (see ยง 30.805(a)(3)). A loss in wages in the trigger month due solely to non-covered illness matters, such as a reduction in force or voluntary retirement, is not proof of compensable wage-loss under Part E.
