####### ยง 30.401 What are the special rules for the services of chiropractors?

(a) The services of chiropractors that may be reimbursed by OWCP are limited to treatment to correct a spinal subluxation. The costs of physical and related laboratory tests performed by or required by a chiropractor to diagnose such a subluxation are also payable.

(b) A diagnosis of spinal subluxation as demonstrated by x-ray to exist must appear in the chiropractor's report before OWCP can consider payment of a chiropractor's bill.

(c) A chiropractor may interpret his or her x-rays to the same extent as any other physician. To be given any weight, the medical report must state that x-rays support the finding of spinal subluxation. OWCP will not necessarily require submission of the x-ray, or a report of the x-ray, but the report must be available for submission on request.

(d) A chiropractor may also provide services in the nature of physical therapy under the direction of a qualified physician.
