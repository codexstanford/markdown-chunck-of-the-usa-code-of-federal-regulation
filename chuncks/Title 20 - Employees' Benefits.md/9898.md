###### Inability to pay.

(i)We may compromise a debt if the debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information. In determining a debtor's inability to pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable time, we will obtain and verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using credit reports and/or a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. We may use a financial information form used in connection with the agency's programs or may request suitable forms from the DOJ or the local United States Attorney's Office. We also may consider other relevant factors such as:

(A) Age and health of the debtor;

(B) Present and potential income;

(C) Inheritance prospects;

(D) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and

(E) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.
