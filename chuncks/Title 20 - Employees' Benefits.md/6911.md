###### ยง 404.2110 What we mean by "SGA" and by "a continuous period of 9 months".
####### What we mean by "a continuous period of 9 months".

(b)A continuous period of 9 months ordinarily means a period of 9 consecutive calendar months. Exception: When an individual does not perform SGA in 9 consecutive calendar months, he or she will be considered to have done so if-

(1) The individual performs 9 months of SGA within 10 consecutive months and has monthly earnings that meet or exceed the guidelines in ยง 404.1574(b)(2), or ยง 404.1584(d) if the individual is statutorily blind; or

(2) The individual performs at least 9 months of SGA within 12 consecutive months, and the reason for not performing SGA in 2 or 3 of those months was due to circumstances beyond his or her control and unrelated to the impairment (e.g., the employer closed down for 3 months).
