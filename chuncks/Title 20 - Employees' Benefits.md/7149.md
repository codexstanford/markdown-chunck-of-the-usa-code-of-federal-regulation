(a) We have determined that you owe a specific overpayment balance that can be collected by cross-program recovery;

(b) We will withhold a specific amount from the title II or title XVI benefits (see ยง 408.931(b));

(c) You may ask us to review this determination that you still owe this overpayment balance;

(e) You may ask us to waive collection of this overpayment balance.
