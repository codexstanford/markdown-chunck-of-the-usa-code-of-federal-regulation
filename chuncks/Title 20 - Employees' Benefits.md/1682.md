### Subchapter B - Regulations Under the Railroad Retirement Act
#### PART 226 - COMPUTING EMPLOYEE, SPOUSE, AND DIVORCED SPOUSE ANNUITIES
##### Subpart C - Computing a Spouse or Divorced Spouse Annuity
###### § 226.30 Spouse or divorced spouse tier I.
####### Age reduction.

(e)If the spouse or divorced spouse is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see §§ 216.51 and 216.52 of this chapter), the rounded tier I rate from paragraph (d) of this section is multiplied by a fraction for each month the spouse or divorced spouse is under retirement age on the date the annuity begins. The result is subtracted from the rate from paragraph (d) of this section. At present the fraction isof 1% (or 1/144). In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is awarded a disability annuity on July 1, 1984, or later, where the spouse does not have a child of the employee under age 18 in care, the spouse tier I is reduced for each month the spouse is under retirement age on the date the spouse annuity begins. If the spouse is age 60 or 61, he or she is deemed to be age 62 for purposes of the age reduction. The age reduction is applied before reduction for a government pension.
