###### What audiometric testing do we need when you do not have a cochlear implant?

2.

a. We generally need pure tone air conduction and bone conduction testing, speech reception threshold (SRT) testing (also referred to as "spondee threshold" or "ST" testing), and word recognition testing (also referred to as "word discrimination" or "speech discrimination" testing). This testing must be conducted in a sound-treated booth or room and must be in accordance with the most recently published standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Each ear must be tested separately.
