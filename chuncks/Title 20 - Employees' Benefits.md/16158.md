###### ยง 802.207 When a notice of appeal is considered to have been filed in the office of the Clerk of the Board.
####### Date of mailing.

(b)If the notice of appeal is sent by mail and the fixing of the date of delivery as the date of filing would result in a loss or impairment of appeal rights, it will be considered to have been filed as of the date of mailing. The date appearing on the U.S. Postal Service postmark (when available and legible) shall be prima facie evidence of the date of mailing. If there is no such postmark or it is not legible, other evidence, such as, but not limited to, certified mail receipts, certificate of service and affidavits, may be used to establish the mailing date.
