###### Establishing that the disorder began before age 22.

4.We require evidence that demonstrates or supports (is consistent with) the conclusion that your mental disorder began prior to age 22. We do not require evidence that your impairment met all of the requirements of 12.05A or 12.05B prior to age 22. Also, we do not require you to have met our statutory definition of disability prior to age 22. When we do not have evidence that was recorded before you attained age 22, we need evidence about your current intellectual and adaptive functioning and the history of your disorder that supports the conclusion that the disorder began before you attained age 22. Examples of evidence that can demonstrate or support this conclusion include:

a. Tests of intelligence or adaptive functioning;

b. School records indicating a history of special education services based on your intellectual functioning;

c. An Individualized Education Program (IEP), including your transition plan;

d. Reports of your academic performance and functioning at school;

e. Medical treatment records;

f. Interviews or reports from employers;

g. Statements from a supervisor in a group home or a sheltered workshop; and

h. Statements from people who have known you and can tell us about your functioning in the past and currently.
