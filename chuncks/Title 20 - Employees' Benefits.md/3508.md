#### Subpart E - Deductions; Reductions; and Nonpayments of Benefits
##### § 404.413 After my benefits are reduced for age what happens if there is an increase in my primary insurance amount?
###### How was the reduction computed for increases prior to 1978?

(d)When the individual's primary insurance amount increased, the amount of the increase was reduced separately under §§ 404.410 and 404.411. The separate reduction was based on the number of months from the effective date of the increase through the month of attainment of age 65. This reduced increase amount was then added to the reduced benefit that was in effect in the month before the effective date of the increase. The result was the new monthly benefit amount.
