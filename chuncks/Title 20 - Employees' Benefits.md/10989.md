##### ยง 618.225 Criteria for certification of a group of workers.
###### Staffed workers.

(i)The Department considers staffed workers to be members of a worker group even if they are not specifically mentioned within the determination document issued under ยง 618.235. The Department will collect information from the workers' firm during the investigation to establish which leasing or staffing entity or entities the firm used under a contract. Once identified, an evaluation of operational control will occur. If a certification is rendered, the Department will notify States regarding the appropriate contact information of the known leasing or staffing entity or entities in order to expedite worker notification of their eligibility to apply individually for TAA Program benefits and services. Factors to be considered in evaluating operational control include:

(1) Whether the contract workers perform only tasks that are independent, discrete projects for the workers' firm (as opposed to performing tasks that are part of the regular business operations of the firm);

(2) Whether the workers' firm has the discretion to hire, fire, and discipline the contract workers;

(3) Whether the workers' firm has the ability to terminate the contract workers' employment with such firm through the staffing or leasing contracted firm;

(4) Whether the workers' firm exercises the authority to supervise the contract workers' daily work activities, including assigning and managing work, and determining how, where, and when the work of contract worker takes place (e.g., factors such as the hours of work, the selection of work, and the manner in which the work is to be performed by each contract worker are relevant);

(5) Whether the services of the contract workers are offered on the open market;

(6) Whether the contract workers work exclusively for the workers' firm;

(7) Whether the workers' firm is responsible for establishing wage rates and the payment of salaries of the contract workers;

(8) Whether the workers' firm provides skills training to the contract workers; and

(9) Whether there are other facts indicating that the workers' firm exercises control over the contract workers.
