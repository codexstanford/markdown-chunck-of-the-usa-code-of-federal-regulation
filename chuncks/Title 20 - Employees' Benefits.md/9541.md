####### In-kind earned income.

(d)We count the current market value of in-kind earned income. For purposes of this part, we use the definition of current market value in ยง 416.1101 of this chapter. If you receive an item that is not fully paid for and you are responsible for the unpaid balance, only the paid-up value is income to you (see example in ยง 416.1123(c) of this chapter).
