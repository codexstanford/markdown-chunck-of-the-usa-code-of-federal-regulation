###### Formal programs,Participants.

(ii)-(A)Formal programs are programs that meet all of the requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) and paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Whether a program qualifies as a formal program is determined on a participant-by-participant basis. A qualifying program qualifies as a formal program with respect to a participant if the participant simultaneously participates in the program in the same physical location with at least two other participants engaged in substantive pension service, and the participants have the opportunity to interact with another individual qualified with respect to the course content who serves as an instructor, whether or not the instructor is in the same physical location. Groups of three or more participants who are in the same physical location may participate in a formal program in person or via the Internet, videoconferencing, or teleconferencing. If the qualifying program is pre-recorded, to qualify as a formal program, there must be a qualified individual who serves as the instructor and is available to answer questions immediately following the pre-recorded program.
