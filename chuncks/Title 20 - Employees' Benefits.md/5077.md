####### unless

(3) Waiver of recovery of an overpayment resulting from the continued benefits paid to you or anyone else receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income (or because of your disability) may be considered as long as the determination was appealed in good faith. It will be assumed that such appeal is made in good faith and, therefore, any overpaid individual has the right to waiver considerationsuch individual fails to cooperate in connection with the appeal, e.g., if the individual fails (without good reason) to give us medical or other evidence we request, or to go for a physical or mental examination when requested by us, in connection with the appeal. In determining whether an individual has good cause for failure to cooperate and, thus, whether an appeal was made in good faith, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual may have which may have caused the individual's failure to cooperate.
