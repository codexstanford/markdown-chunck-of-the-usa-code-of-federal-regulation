###### Effect of Tort Suits Against Beryllium Vendors and Atomic Weapons Employers
####### ยง 30.620 How will OWCP ascertain whether a claimant filed this type of tort suit and if he or she has been disqualified from receiving any benefits under Part B of EEOICPA?

Prior to authorizing payment on a claim under Part B of EEOICPA, OWCP will require each claimant to execute and provide an affidavit stating if he or she filed a tort suit (other than an administrative or judicial proceeding for workers' compensation) against either a beryllium vendor or an atomic weapons employer that included a claim arising out of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation, and if so, the current status of such tort suit. OWCP may also require the submission of any supporting evidence necessary to confirm the particulars of any affidavit provided under this section.
