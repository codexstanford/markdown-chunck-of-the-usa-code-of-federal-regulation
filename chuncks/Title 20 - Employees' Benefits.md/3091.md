###### ยง 404.141 How we credit quarters of coverage for calendar years before 1978.
####### General.

(a)The rules in this section tell how we credit calendar quarters as quarters of coverage (QCs) for calendar years before 1978. We credit you with a QC for a calendar quarter based on the amount of wages you were paid and self-employment income you derived during certain periods. The rules in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are subject to the limitations in ยง 404.146, which tells when a calendar quarter cannot be a QC.
