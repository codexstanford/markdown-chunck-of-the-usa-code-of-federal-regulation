####### Payments for services.

(2)For the purpose of determining SGA, a payment you make for services may be deducted if the services are received while you are working and the payment is made in a month you are working. We consider you to be working even though you must leave work temporarily to receive the services. For the purpose of determining your SSI monthly payment amount, a payment you make for services may be deducted if the payment is made in the month your earned income is received and the earned income is for work done in the month you received the services. If you begin working and make a payment before the month earned income is received, the payment is also deductible. If you make a payment after you stop working, and the payment is made in the month you received earned income for work done in the month you received the services, the payment is also deductible.
