###### ยง 416.1160 What is deeming of income?
####### Sponsor of an alien.

(3)If you are an alien who has a sponsor and you first apply for SSI benefits after September 30, 1980, we look at your sponsor's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. This rule applies for 3 years after you are admitted to the United States for permanent residence and regardless of whether you live in the same household as your sponsor. We deem your sponsor's income to you because your sponsor agreed to support you (signed an affidavit of support) as a condition of your admission to the United States. If two deeming rules could apply to you because your sponsor is also your ineligible spouse or parent who lives with you, we use the appropriate spouse-to-spouse or parent-to-child deeming rules instead of the sponsor-to-alien rules. If you have a sponsor and also have an ineligible spouse or parent who is not your sponsor and whose income can be deemed to you, both rules apply. If your sponsor is not your parent or spouse but is the ineligible spouse or parent of another SSI beneficiary, we use the sponsor-to-alien deeming rules for you and the appropriate spouse-to-spouse or parent-to-child deeming rules for the other SSI beneficiary.
