#### ยง 402.165 Fee schedule.
##### Billing exceeds cost of service.

(h)Generally we will not charge you a fee when the cost of the service is less than the cost of sending you a bill. However, where an individual, organization, or governmental unit makes multiple separate requests, we will total the costs incurred and periodically bill the requester for the services rendered.
