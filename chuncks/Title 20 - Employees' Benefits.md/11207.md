###### Conditions for amending approved training.

(a)The State must, with the cooperation of the trade-affected worker, amend a worker's approved training program under the following conditions:

(1) The State determines that one or more of these conditions are present:

(i) A course or courses designed to satisfy unforeseen needs of the worker, such as remedial education or new employer skills requirements, are necessary;

(ii) A course or courses added to the training program will enhance and complement the worker's original training program, such as preparatory courses to obtain an industry-recognized credential, certification, or license that will improve the worker's chance of being hired;

(iii) Additional assistance such as tutoring or the use of translators would benefit the worker, keep the worker qualified for the training in which he or she is enrolled, and be sufficient for the worker to complete the training program;

(iv) Approval of a longerterm training program that will improve the likelihood of employment upon the completion of such training;

(v) The originally approved training program cannot be successfully completed by the worker;

(vi) The originally approved training program is determined to be of inferior quality;

(vii) Training in another occupation will lead to a greater likelihood of training completion or a better employment outcome, as a result of a change in labor market conditions or the worker's experience in the originally approved training program, or other similar factor;

(viii) The worker is moving from full-time training to part-time training or from part-time training to full-time training;

(ix) An AAIW has been separated from adversely affected employment and has transitioned to become an AAW, or an AAIW is continuing training after a threat of separation was first removed, then resumed; or

(x) An additional source of funding becomes available for which a prearrangement is required under ยง 618.625(c)(4).

(2) The combination of time spent in the originally approved training program and the time it will take to complete the amended training program will not exceed the duration of training limit for the type of training included in the training program, as provided at ยง 618.615(d)(3).

(3) Amending the approved training program occurs before a worker finishes the originally approved training program and prior to the originally scheduled date of completion.
