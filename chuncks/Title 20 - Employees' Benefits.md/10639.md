### PART 614 - UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION FOR EX-SERVICEMEMBERS
#### Appendix B to Part 614 - Standard for Claim Determination - Separation Information
##### Information required to be given.

1.Employees are required to give their employers information and instructions concerning the employees' potential rights to benefits and concerning registration for work and filing claims for benefits.

The information furnished to employees under such a requirement need not be elaborate; it need only be adequate to insure that the worker who is separated or who is working less than full time knows he is potentially eligible for benefits and is informed as to what he is to do or where he is to go to file his claim and register for work. When he files his claim, he can obtain more detailed information.

In States that do not require employers to furnish periodically to the State agency detailed reports of the wages paid to their employees, each employer is required to furnish to his employees information as to: (a) The name under which he is registered by the State agency, (b) the address where he maintains his payroll records, and (c) the workers' need for this information if and when they file claims for benefits.
