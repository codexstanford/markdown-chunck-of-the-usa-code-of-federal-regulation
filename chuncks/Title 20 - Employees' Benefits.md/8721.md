##### § 416.1246 Disposal of resources at less than fair market value.
###### General.

(a)(1) An individual (or eligible spouse) who gives away or sells a nonexcluded resource for less than fair market value for the purpose of establishing SSI or Medicaid eligibility will be charged with the difference between the fair market value of the resource and the amount of compensation received. The difference is referred to as uncompensated value and is counted toward the resource limit (see § 416.1205) for a period of 24 months from the date of transfer.

(2) If the transferred resource (asset) is returned to the individual, the uncompensated value is no longer counted as of the date of return. If the transferred asset is cash, the uncompensated value is reduced as of the date of return by the amount of cash that is returned. No income will be charged as a result of such returns. The returned asset will be evaluated as a resource according to the rules described in §§ 416.1201 through 416.1230 as of the first day of the following month.

(3) If the individual receives additional compensation in the form of cash for the transferred asset the uncompensated value is reduced, as of the date the additional cash compensation is received, by the amount of that additional compensation.
