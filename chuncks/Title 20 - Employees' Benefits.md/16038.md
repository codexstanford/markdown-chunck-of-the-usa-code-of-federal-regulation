###### § 726.104 Action by the Office upon application of operator.

(a) Upon receipt of a completed application for authorization to self-insure, the Office shall, after examination of the information contained in the application, either deny the request or determine the amount of security which must be given by the applicant to guarantee the payment of benefits and the discharge of all other obligations which may be required of such applicant under the Act.

(b) The applicant shall thereafter be notified that he may give security in the amount fixed by the Office (see § 726.105):

(1) In the form of an indemnity bond with sureties satisfactory to the Office;

(2) By a deposit of negotiable securities with a Federal Reserve Bank in compliance with §§ 726.106(c) and 726.107;

(3) In the form of a letter of credit issued by a financial institution satisfactory to the Office (except that a letter of credit shall not be sufficient by itself to satisfy a self-insurer's obligations under this part); or

(4) By funding a trust pursuant to section 501(c)(21) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.).

(c) Any applicant who cannot meet the security deposit requirements imposed by the Office should proceed to obtain a commercial policy or contract of insurance. Any applicant for authorization to self-insure whose application has been rejected or who believes that the security deposit requirements imposed by the Office are excessive may, in writing, request that the Office review its determination. A request for review should contain such information as may be necessary to support the request that the amount of security required be reduced.

(d) Upon receipt of any such request, the Office shall review its previous determination in light of any new or additional information submitted and inform the applicant whether or not a reduction in the amount of security initially required is warranted.
