2.

a. We have the following requirements for resting ABG tests under these listings:

(i) You must be medically stable at the time of the test. See 3.00E2a.

(ii) The test must be administered while you are breathing room air; that is, without oxygen supplementation.

b. The resting ABG test report must include the following information:

(i) Your name, the date of the test, and either the altitude or both the city and State of the test site.

(ii) The POand PCOvalues.

c. We may need to purchase a resting ABG test to determine whether your disorder meets 3.02C2 when we have evidence showing that you have a chronic respiratory disorder that could result in impaired gas exchange, unless we can make a fully favorable determination or decision on another basis.

d. Before we purchase a resting ABG test, a medical consultant (see §§ 404.1616 and 416.1016 of this chapter), preferably one with experience in the care of people with respiratory disorders, must review your case record to determine if we need the test. The medical source we designate to administer the test is solely responsible for deciding whether it is safe for you to do the test and for how to administer it.
