#### ยง 650.4 Review of State law and criteria for review of State compliance.

(a) A State law will satisfy the requirements of ยง 650.3(a) if it contains a provision requiring, or is construed to require, hearing and decision for claimants who are parties to an administrative appeal affecting benefit rights with the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible.

(b) A State will be deemed to comply substantially with the State law requirements set forth in ยง 650.3(a) with respect to first level appeals, the State has issued at least 60 percent of all first level benefit appeal decisions within 30 days of the date of appeal, and at least 80 percent of all first level benefit appeal decisions within 45 days. These computations will be derived from the State's regular reports required pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Manual, part III, sections 4400-4450.
