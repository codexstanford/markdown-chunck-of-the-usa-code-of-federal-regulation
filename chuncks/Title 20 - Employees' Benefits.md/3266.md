## Chapter III - Social Security Administration
### PART 404 - FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950- )
#### Subpart C - Computing Primary Insurance Amounts
##### Appendix VII to Subpart C of Part 404 - "Old-Law" Contribution and Benefit Base
###### Explanation:

We use these figures to determine the earnings needed for a year of coverage for years after 1978 (see ยง 404.261 and appendix IV). This is the contribution and benefit base that would have been effective under the Social Security Act without the enactment of the 1977 amendments.
