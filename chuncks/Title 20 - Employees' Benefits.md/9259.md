###### Meeting the pass-along requirements-supplementary payment levels.

(b)The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).

(1) We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels (described in ยง 416.2098) for a particular month or months after March 1983 if the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in March 1983 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after March 1983, the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments), increased by any subsequent Federal SSI benefit increases, except as provided in ยง 416.2097(b) and ยง 416.2097(c). We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months between June 1977 and April 1983 if the supplementary payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in December 1976 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after December 1976, the levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments, or in certain cases described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the levels in effect in December 1981.)

(2) We will also consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months in the period July 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, if the State had met the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section for a particular month or months in the 12-month period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, and, with respect to any month in the period July 1, 1982 through March 31, 1983, the State maintained the payment levels in effect in December 1981.

(3) If a State reduced any of its supplementary payment levels for a month or months within any 12-month period beginning with the effective date of a Federal benefit increase, we will consider the State to have met the requirement to maintain its supplementary payment levels if-

(i) Within 12 months after the relevant 12-month period, the State restores the levels retroactively; and

(ii) The State makes a single retroactive benefit payment to each of the beneficiaries eligible for the retroactive payment.
