###### ยง 416.1161a Income for deeming purposes where Medicaid eligibility is affected.
####### General.

(a)In many States, an individual who is eligible for SSI or a Federally administered State optional supplementary payment is in turn eligible for Medicaid. Also, several other States use SSI deeming rules in determining eligibility for Medicaid. In all of these States, in extraordinary cases, the Department will not apply the usual rules on deeming of income where those rules would result in an individual's being ineligible for SSI (or a Federally administered State optional supplementary payment) and Medicaid. Any determination made under this section may at any time be revised based on new information or changed circumstances.
