###### How do we evaluate your neurological disorder when it does not meet one of these listings?

R.

1. If your neurological disorder does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether your impairment(s) meets the criteria of a listing in another body system. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing. See ยง 416.926 of this chapter.

2. If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, we will consider whether your impairment(s) functionally equals the listings. See ยง 416.926a of this chapter.

3. We use the rules in ยง 416.994a of this chapter when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.
