###### ยง 404.2110 What we mean by "SGA" and by "a continuous period of 9 months".
####### What work we consider.

(c)In determining if a continuous period of SGA has been completed, all of an individual's work activity may be evaluated for purposes of this section, including work performed before October 1981, during the waiting period, during the trial work period and after entitlement to disability benefits terminated. We will ordinarily consider only the first 9 months of SGA that occur. The exception will be if an individual who completed 9 months of SGA later stops performing SGA, receives VR services and then performs SGA for a 9-month period. See ยง 404.2115 for the use of the continuous period in determining payment for VR services.
