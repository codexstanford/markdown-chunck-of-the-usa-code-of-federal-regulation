###### ยง 404.110 How we determine fully insured status.
####### General.

(a)We describe how we determine the number of quarters of coverage (QCs) you need to be fully insured in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The table in ยง 404.115 may be used to determine the number of QCs you need to be fully insured under paragraph (b) of this section. We consider certain World War II veterans to have died fully insured (see ยง 404.111). We also consider certain employees of private nonprofit organizations to be fully insured if they meet special requirements (see ยง 404.112).
