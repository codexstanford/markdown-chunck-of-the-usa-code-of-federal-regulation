(c)The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).

(1) If a State does not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months if total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period within which the month or months fall, beginning on the effective date of a Federal SSI benefit increase, are at least equal to the total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period immediately before the Federal SSI benefit increase provided that the State was in compliance for such preceding 12-month period. The combined Federal/State payment level for those persons receiving a mandatory minimum State supplementary payment can be no lower than the recipient's total income for December 1973 as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66.

(2) If total State expenditures in the relevant 12-month period are less than the total expenditures in the preceding 12-month period (a "shortfall"), we also will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for the relevant 12-month period if in the following 12-month period the State increases the total expenditures required for that period by an amount at least equal to the amount of the shortfall in the relevant 12-month period. The increased amount up to the amount needed to correct the shortfall shall be deemed to be an expenditure in the relevant 12-month period, for pass-along purposes only. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.)

(3)(i) Exception for the 6-month period from July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983: We will consider the State to have met the total-expenditures requirement for the 6-month period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, if-

(A) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period July l, 1982 through December 31, 1982;

(B) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period January 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1982; or

(C) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983 equal or exceed one-half of the total of such expenditures for the period July 1, 1982 through June 30, 1983. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and of ยง 416.2099 (b), (c), and (d) shall apply to this 6-month period in the same manner as they apply to the 12-month periods referred to therein.

(ii) Exception for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981: If a State did not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the maintenance-of-supplementary-payment-levels requirement for this 12-month period if the State's expenditures for supplementary payments in that period were at least equal to its expenditures for such payments for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1977 (or, if the State made no supplementary payments in that period, the expenditures for the first 12-month period ending June 30 in which the State made such payments); if a State made additional State supplementary payments during the period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, in order to make up a shortfall in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981 (determined by a comparison with the preceding 12-month period) which later resulted in an excess payment (determined by comparison with the 12-month period July 1, 1976 through June 30, 1977) we will credit the State with the amount of the excess payments if the State so requests. This credit will be applied to any shortfall(s) in total expenditures (should one exist) in any period(s) ending on or before December 31, 1986.

(4) Total State expenditures for supplementary payments are the State's total payments for both mandatory minimum and optional State supplementary payments in the appropriate 12-month period less any amounts deemed to be expenditures for another 12-month period under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, less the amount of any payments recovered and other adjustments made in that period. Total State expenditures do not include State administrative expenses, interim assistance payments, vendor payments, or payments made under other Federal programs, such as titles IV, XIX, or XX of the Social Security Act.

(5) Adjustments in total State supplementary payments made after the expiration of the relevant 12-month period for purposes of meeting total State expenditures under paragraph (c) of this section shall be considered a State expenditure in the relevant 12-month period only for purposes of the pass-along requirement. For purposes of ยง 416.2090 of this part, which discusses the rules for limitation on fiscal liability of States (hold harmless), these retroactive adjustments are State expenditures when made and shall be counted as a State expenditure in the fiscal year in which the adjustments are made.
