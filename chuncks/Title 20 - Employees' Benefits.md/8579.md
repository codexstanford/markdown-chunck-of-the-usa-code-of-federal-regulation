###### ยง 416.1165 How we deem income to you from your ineligible parent(s).
####### You become subject to the $30 Federal benefit rate.

(6)If you become a resident of a medical treatment facility and the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we do not deem your ineligible parent's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we only use your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible parent.
