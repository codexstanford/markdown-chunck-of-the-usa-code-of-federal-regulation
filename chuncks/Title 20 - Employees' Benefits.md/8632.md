#### Subpart L - Resources and Exclusions
##### § 416.1204 Deeming of resources of the sponsor of an alien.
###### Exclusions from the sponsor's resources.

(a)Before we deem a sponsor's resources to an alien, we exclude the same kinds of resources that are excluded from the resources of an individual eligible for SSI benefits. The applicable exclusions from resources are explained in §§ 416.1210 (paragraphs (a) through (i), (k), and (m) through (t)) through 416.1239 and §§ 416.1247 through 416.1249. For resources excluded by Federal statutes other than the Social Security Act, as applicable to the resources of sponsors deemed to aliens, see the appendix to subpart K of part 416. We next allocate for the sponsor or for the sponsor and spouse (if living together). (The amount of the allocation is the applicable resource limit described in § 416.1205 for an eligible individual and an individual and spouse.)
