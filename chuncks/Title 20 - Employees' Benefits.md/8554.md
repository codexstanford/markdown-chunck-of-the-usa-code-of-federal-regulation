###### ยง 416.1163 How we deem income to you from your ineligible spouse.
####### Allocations for aliens sponsored by your ineligible spouse.

(c)We also deduct an allocation for eligible aliens who have been sponsored by and who have income deemed from your ineligible spouse.

(1) The allocation for each alien who is sponsored by and who has income deemed from your ineligible spouse is the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual. The amount of the allocation automatically increases whenever the Federal benefit rate increases. The amount of the allocation that we use to compute your benefit for a current month is based on the Federal benefit rate that applied in the second prior month (unless the current month is the first or second month of eligibility or re-eligibility as explained in ยง 416.420(a) and (b) (2) and (3)).

(2) Each alien's allocation is reduced by the amount of his or her own income as described in ยง 416.1161(d).

(3) We first deduct the allocations from your ineligible spouse's unearned income. If your ineligible spouse does not have enough unearned income to cover the allocations, we deduct the balance from your ineligible spouse's earned income.
