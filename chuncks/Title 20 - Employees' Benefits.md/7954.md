####### How we will decide that your impairment(s) functionally equals the listings.,See

(d)We will decide that your impairment(s) functionally equals the listings if it is of listing-level severity. Your impairment(s) is of listing-level severity if you have "marked" limitations in two of the domains in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or an "extreme" limitation in one domain. We will not compare your functioning to the requirements of any specific listing. We explain what the terms "marked" and "extreme" mean in paragraph (e) of this section. We explain how we use the domains in paragraph (f) of this section, and describe each domain in paragraphs (g)-(l). You must also meet the duration requirement. (ยง 416.909.)
