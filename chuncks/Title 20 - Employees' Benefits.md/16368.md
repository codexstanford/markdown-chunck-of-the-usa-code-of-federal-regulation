###### Records exempt in whole or in part.

(4)(i) When an individual requests records concerning himself which have been compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding either in a court or before an administrative tribunal, the Executive Director will neither confirm nor deny the existence of the record but shall advise the individual only that no record available to him pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 has been identified.

(ii) Requests for records which have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) shall be responded to in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section unless a review of the information indicates that the information has been used or is being used to deny the individual any right, privilege or benefit for which he is eligible or to which he would otherwise be entitled under Federal law. In that event, the individual shall be advised of the existence of the information but such information as would identify a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source to the maximum degree possible and the summary extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.

(iii) When an individual requests access to accountings of disclosure from records concerning himself which have been compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding, either in a court or before an administrative tribunal, or which have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Executive Director will neither confirm nor deny the existence of the record or accountings of disclosure therefrom, but shall advise the individual that no accounting available to him pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 has been identified.
