####### ยง 30.505 What procedures will OWCP follow before it pays any compensation?

(a) In cases involving the approval of a claim, whether in whole or in part, OWCP shall take all necessary steps to determine the amount of any offset or coordination of EEOICPA benefits before paying any benefits, and to verify the identity of the covered Part B employee, the covered Part E employee, or the eligible surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. To perform these tasks, OWCP may conduct any investigation, require any claimant to provide or execute any affidavit, record or document, or authorize the release of any information as OWCP deems necessary to ensure that the compensation payment is made in the correct amount and to the correct person or persons. OWCP shall also require every claimant under Part B of the Act to execute and provide any necessary affidavit described in ยง 30.620 of these regulations. Should a claimant fail or refuse to execute an affidavit or release of information, or fail or refuse to provide a requested document or record or to provide access to information, such failure or refusal may be deemed to be a rejection of the payment, unless the claimant does not have and cannot obtain the legal authority to provide, release, or authorize access to the required information, records, or documents.
