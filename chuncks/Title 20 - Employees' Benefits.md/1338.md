####### Unskilled work.

(b)Unskilled work is work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time (30 days). The job may or may not require considerable strength. A job is considered unskilled if the claimant can usually learn to do the job in 30 days, and little job training and judgment are needed. The claimant does not gain work skills by doing unskilled jobs. For example, jobs are considered unskilled if primary work duties are-

(1) Handling;

(2) Feeding;

(3) Offbearing (placing or removing materials from machines which are automatic or operated by others); or

(4) Machine tending.
