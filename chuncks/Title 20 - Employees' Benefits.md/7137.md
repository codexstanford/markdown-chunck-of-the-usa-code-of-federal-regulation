## Chapter III - Social Security Administration
### PART 408 - SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN WORLD WAR II VETERANS
#### Subpart I - Underpayments and Overpayments
##### Waiver of Recovery of SVB Overpayments
###### ยง 408.914 When would overpayment recovery be against equity and good conscience?
####### Example:

We will waive recovery of an overpayment when you are without fault (as defined in ยง 408.912) and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Recovery would be against equity and good conscience if you changed your position for the worse or gave up a valuable right in reliance on our notice that payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment itself.Upon our notice that you are eligible for SVB payments, you signed a lease on an apartment renting for $15 a month more than the one you previously occupied. You were subsequently found ineligible for SVB and no benefits are payable. In this case, recovery of the overpayment would be considered "against equity and good conscience."
