###### ยง 416.994a How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends, and whether you are and have been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and available, disabled children.
####### Removal of a payee who does not provide evidence that a child is and has been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and available.

(4)If your representative payee refuses without good cause to provide evidence that you are and have been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and available, we may, if it is in your best interests, suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and pay benefits to another payee or to you. When we decide whether your representative payee had good cause, we will consider factors such as the acceptable reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment in ยง 416.930(c) and other factors similar to those describing good cause for missing deadlines in ยง 416.1411.
