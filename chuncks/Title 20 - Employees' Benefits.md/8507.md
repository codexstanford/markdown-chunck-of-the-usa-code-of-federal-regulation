##### Temporary Absence
###### ยง 416.1149 What is a temporary absence from your living arrangement.
####### Rules we apply during a temporary absence.

(b)During a temporary absence, we continue to value your support and maintenance the same way that we did in your permanent living arrangement. For example, if the one-third reduction applies in your permanent living arrangement, we continue to apply the same rule during a temporary absence. However, if you receive in-kind support and maintenance only during a temporary absence we do not count it since you are still responsible for maintaining your permanent quarters during the absence.
