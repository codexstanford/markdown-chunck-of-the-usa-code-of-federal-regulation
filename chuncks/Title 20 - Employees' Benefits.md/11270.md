#### Subpart G - Trade Readjustment Allowances
##### ยง 618.765 Qualifying requirements for, and timing and duration of, Completion Trade Readjustment Allowances.
###### Start date of Completion TRA.

(d)The State must have a process to take applications for Completion TRA. States must not automatically establish the 20-week period for Completion TRA as the week following either expiration of the eligibility period for Additional TRA, or the exhaustion of Additional TRA; filing a claim after either of those first weeks is permitted. Since training that leads to a degree or industry-recognized credential must be completed during the eligibility period described in paragraph (c) of this section, the first week of Completion TRA claimed should be carefully considered in coordination with case management while the AAW's training program is being developed.
