###### ยง 416.1163 How we deem income to you from your ineligible spouse.
####### Ineligible spouse becomes eligible.

(1)If your ineligible spouse becomes eligible for SSI benefits, we treat both of you as newly eligible. Therefore, your eligibility and benefit amount for the first month you are an eligible couple will be based on your income in that month. In the second month, your benefit amount will also be based on your income in the first month.
