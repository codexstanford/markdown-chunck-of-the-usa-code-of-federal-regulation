##### Introduction
###### ยง 411.180 What is timely progress toward self-supporting employment?
####### 12-month progress certification periods.

(b)The first 12-month progress certification period begins with the month following the month in which you first assigned your ticket, or with the month beginning after the date described in ยง 411.170(b) if you have a ticket that would otherwise be available for assignment and are receiving VR services under an IPE from a State VR agency which has chosen the VR cost reimbursement option. Any subsequent 12-month progress certification period will begin with the month following the end of the previous 12-month progress certification period. In computing any 12-month progress certification period, we do not count any month during which-

(1) Your ticket is not assigned to an EN or State VR agency acting as an EN and is not in VR cost reimbursement status (as described in ยง 411.166(j)); or

(2) Your ticket is in inactive status (see ยง 411.192).
