###### ยง 404.1068 Employees who are considered self-employed.
####### Employees of a church or church-controlled organization that has elected to exclude employees from coverage as employment.

(f)If you perform services that are excluded from employment as described in ยง 404.1026, you are engaged in a trade or business. Special rules apply to your earnings from those services which are known as church employee income. If you are paid $100 or more in a taxable year by an employer who has elected to have its employees excluded, those earnings are self-employment income (see ยง 404.1096(c)(1)). In figuring your church employee income you may not reduce that income by any deductions attributable to your work. Your church employee income and deductions may not be taken into account in determining the amount of other net earnings from self-employment. Effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1990, your church employee income is exempt from self-employment tax under the conditions set forth for members of certain religious groups (see ยง 404.1075).
