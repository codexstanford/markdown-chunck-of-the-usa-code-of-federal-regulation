The assumption is that constructive and healthy activities offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet the needs usually filled by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and would, therefore, minimize or obviate resort to the latter. Examples of activities conducted and methods used for this strategy include (but are not limited to) the following:

(i) Drug free dances and parties;

(ii) Youth/adult leadership activities;

(iii) Community drop-in centers; and

(iv) Community service activities.
