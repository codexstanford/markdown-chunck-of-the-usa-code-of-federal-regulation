####### Inability to pay.

(1)The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information. In determining a debtor's inability to pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable time, the Secretary will obtain and verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using credit reports or a current financial Statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The Secretary may use a Departmental financial information form or may request suitable forms from Justice or the local United States Attorney's Office. The Secretary also may consider other relevant factors such as:

(i) Age and health of the debtor;

(ii) Present and potential income;

(iii) Inheritance prospects;

(iv) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and

(v) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.
