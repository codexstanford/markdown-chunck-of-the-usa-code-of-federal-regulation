###### ยง 2522.485 How do I calculate my program's budgeted Corporation cost per member service year (MSY)?

If you are an AmeriCorps national and community service program, you calculate your Corporation cost per MSY by dividing the Corporation's share of budgeted grant costs by the number of member service years you are awarded in your grant. You do not include child-care or the cost of the education award a member may earn through serving with your program.
