####### Determination of grantee shares of leveraging incentive funds.

(i)Allocation of leveraging incentive funds to grantees will be computed according to a formula using the following factors and weights:

(1) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base period by a grantee relative to its net Federal allotment of funds allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) during the base period, as a proportion of the final net value of the countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base period relative to their net Federal allotment of funds allocated under that section during the base period; and

(2) Fifty (50) percent based on the final net value of countable leveraged resources provided to low-income households during the base period by a grantee as a proportion of the total final net value of the countable leveraged resources provided by all grantees during the base period; except that: No grantee may receive more than twelve (12.0) percent of the total amount of leveraging incentive funds available for distribution to grantees in any award period; and no grantee may receive more than the smaller of its net Federal allotment of funds allocated under section 2602(b) of Public Law 97-35 (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) during the base period, or two times (double) the final net value of its countable leveraged resources for the base period. The calculations will be based on data contained in the leveraging reports submitted by grantees under paragraph (h) of this section as approved by the Department, and allocation data developed by the Department.
