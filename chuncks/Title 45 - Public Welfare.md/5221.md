####### Factors in determining noncompliance and amount of CMPs, if any.

(h)In determining whether there has been noncompliance by the consumer assistance entity, and whether CMPs are appropriate:

(1) HHS must take into account the following:

(i) The consumer assistance entity's previous or ongoing record of compliance, including but not limited to compliance or noncompliance with any corrective action plan.

(ii) The gravity of the violation, which may be determined in part by-

(A) The frequency of the violation, taking into consideration whether any violation is an isolated occurrence, represents a pattern, or is widespread; and

(B) Whether the violation caused, or could reasonably be expected to cause, financial or other adverse impacts on consumer(s), and the magnitude of those impacts;

(2) HHS may take into account the following:

(i) The degree of culpability of the consumer assistance entity, including but not limited to-

(A) Whether the violation was beyond the direct control of the consumer assistance entity; and

(B) The extent to which the consumer assistance entity received compensation-legal or otherwise-for the services associated with the violation;

(ii) Aggravating or mitigating circumstances;

(iii) Whether other remedies or penalties have been assessed and/or imposed for the same conduct or occurrence; or

(iv) Other such factors as justice may require.
