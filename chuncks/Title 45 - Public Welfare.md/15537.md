###### ยง 2105.4 How should you describe the records you seek?

(a) You must reasonably describe the records sought. A reasonable description contains sufficient detail to enable Agency personnel familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.

(b) You should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or types of records that you are seeking. This will assist the Agency in identifying the requested records (for example, time frames involved or specific personnel who may have the requested records). For example, whenever possible, identify:

(1) The date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject of any particular records you seek;

(2) The office that created the records you seek;

(3) The timeframe for which you are seeking records; and

(4) Any other information that will assist the Agency in locating the records.

(c) The Agency's FOIA Officer or Public Liaison can assist you in formulating or reformulating a request in an effort to better identify the records you seek.
