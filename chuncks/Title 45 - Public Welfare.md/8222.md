####### When withheld.

(a)Further payments to a State are withheld in whole or in part if the Administrator, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of an approved plan, finds:

(1) That the plan no longer complies with the provisions of section 2, 402, 1002, 1402, or 1602 of the Act; or

(2) That in the administration of the plan there is failure to comply substantially with any such provision.

A question of noncompliance of a State plan may arise from an unapprovable change in the approved State plan, the failure of the State to change its approved plan to conform to a new Federal requirement for approval of State plans, or the failure of the State in practice to comply with a Federal requirement, whether or not its State plan has been amended to conform to such requirement.
