####### ยง 1150.6 What opportunity do I have to obtain a review of my debt within the Endowment?
######## Review official.

(c)The Chairperson shall designate an officer or employee of the Endowment (who was not involved in the determination of the debt) as the review official. When required by law or regulation, the Endowment may request an administrative law judge to conduct the review, or may obtain a review official who is an official, employee, or agent of the United States, but who is not under the supervision or control of the Chairperson. However, unless the review is conducted by an official or employee of the Endowment, any unresolved dispute you have regarding whether all or part of the debt is past due or legally enforceable (for purposes of collection by tax refund offset under ยง 1150.31) must be referred to the Chairperson for ultimate administrative disposition, and the Chairperson must notify you of his or her determination.
