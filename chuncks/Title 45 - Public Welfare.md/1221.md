######## Governmental revenues.

(c)Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Federal award or HHS awarding agency regulations as program income.

(1) The Patent and Trademark Laws Amendments, 34 U.S.C. 200-212, apply to inventions made under an award for performance of experimental, developmental, or research work.

(2) Unless the terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to HHS with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award. However, no scholarship, fellowship, training grant, or other funding agreement made primarily to a recipient for educational purposes will contain any provision giving the HHS awarding agency rights to inventions made by the recipient.
