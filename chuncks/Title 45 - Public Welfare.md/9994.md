###### ยง 410.700 Conducting age determinations.

Procedures for determining the age of an individual must take into account the totality of the circumstances and evidence, including the non-exclusive use of radiographs, to determine the age of the individual. ORR may require an individual in ORR's custody to submit to a medical or dental examination conducted by a medical professional or to submit to other appropriate procedures to verify his or her age. If ORR subsequently determines that such an individual is a UAC, he or she will be treated in accordance with ORR's UAC regulations in this part for all purposes.
