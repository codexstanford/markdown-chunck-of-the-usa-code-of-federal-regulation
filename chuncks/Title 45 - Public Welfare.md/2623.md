######## Functional Requirements Specification

is defined as an initial definition of the proposed system, which documents the goals, objectives, user or programmatic requirements, management requirements, the operating environment, and the proposed design methodology, e.g., centralized or distributed. This document details what the new system and or hardware should do, not how it is to do it. The Specifications document shall be based upon a clear and accurate description of the functional requirements for the project, and shall not, in competitive procurements, lead to requirements which unduly restrict competition. The Specification document is the user's definition of the requirements the system must meet.
