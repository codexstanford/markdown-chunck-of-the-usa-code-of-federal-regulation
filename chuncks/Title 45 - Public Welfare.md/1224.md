######## Deduction.

(1)Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income must be used for current costs unless the HHS awarding agency authorizes otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.
