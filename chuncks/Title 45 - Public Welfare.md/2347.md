###### Cooperation.

(c)The Department, each recipient, and each sub-recipient shall cooperate with any compliance review, investigation, interview, or other part of OCR's enforcement process, which may include production of documents, participation in interviews, response to data requests, and making available of premises for inspection where relevant. Failure to cooperate may result in an OCR referral to the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Department's Office of the General Counsel, for further enforcement in Federal court or otherwise. Each recipient or sub-recipient shall permit access by OCR during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, as well as its facilities, as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar OCR from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with this part. Information of a confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance reviews, investigations, or other enforcement activities shall not be disclosed except as required in formal enforcement proceedings or as otherwise required by law.
