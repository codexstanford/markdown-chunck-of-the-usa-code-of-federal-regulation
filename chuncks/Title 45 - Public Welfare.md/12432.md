####### How to make a request.

(a)Your FOIA request need not be in any particular format, but it must be in writing, include your full name, mailing address, daytime telephone number. If you choose to submit your request on the NEH Web site, the request must also include your email address. Your request should be clearly identified as a FOIA request in both the text of the request and on the envelope (or on the facsimile or in the subject heading of an email message) and must describe the requested records in enough detail to enable NEH staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The NEH has no obligation to answer questions posed as FOIA requests or to create records to satisfy a FOIA request.
