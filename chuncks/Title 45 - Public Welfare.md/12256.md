###### ยง 1159.12 Will the Endowment charge me fees to locate, review, or copy records?
####### e.g.,

(b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.10 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying (punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. A copying fee totaling $3.00 or less shall be waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.

(c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you.

(d) A copying fee shall not be charged or, alternatively, it may be reduced, when the General Counsel determines, based on a petition, that the petitioning individual is indigent and that the Endowment's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee.

(e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to the "National Endowment for the Arts."
