###### ยง 1148.5 When will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?
####### Aggregating requests.

(d)To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Arts Endowment may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Arts Endowment will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
