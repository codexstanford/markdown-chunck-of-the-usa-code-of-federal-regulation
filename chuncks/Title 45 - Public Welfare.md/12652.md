######## Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

(d)Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section, NEH may request that OPM offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and "flag" a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that NEH initiate offset prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
