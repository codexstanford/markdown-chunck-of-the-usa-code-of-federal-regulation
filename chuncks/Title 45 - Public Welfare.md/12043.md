####### ยง 1150.11 How does subdividing or joining debts owed to the Endowment affect the Chairperson's compromise, suspension, or termination authority?

A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract will be considered as a single claim in determining whether the claim is one of not more than $100,000, excluding interest, for the purpose of compromise or suspension or termination of collection action. Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. Joining two or more claims in a demand upon a debtor for payment of more than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or suspension or termination of collection action with regard to any one claim not exceeding $100,000, excluding interest.
