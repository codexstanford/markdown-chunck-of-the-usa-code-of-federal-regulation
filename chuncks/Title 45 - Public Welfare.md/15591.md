###### ยง 2105.43 When will the Agency waive fees?
####### see

(c) When deciding whether to waive or reduce fees, the Agency will rely on the fee waiver justification submitted in your request letter. If the letter does not include sufficient justification, the Agency will deny the fee waiver request. The Agency may, at its discretion, request additional information from you (ยง 2105.49).

(d) The burden is on you to justify entitlement to a fee waiver. Requests for fee waivers are decided on a case-by-case basis under the criteria discussed in paragraph (a) of this section and ยง 2105.46. If you have received a fee waiver in the past, that does not mean you are automatically entitled to a fee waiver for every request submitted.

(e) The Agency must not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is "important" enough to be made public; it is not the Agency's role to attempt to determine the level of public interest in requested information.
