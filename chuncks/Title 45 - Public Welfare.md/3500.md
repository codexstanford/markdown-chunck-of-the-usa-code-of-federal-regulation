####### Conclusion.,Example 2

(B)The same terms requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section is satisfied in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) () because, under the special rule for new hires in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the full-time employees newly hired on and after January 1, 2022, may be treated as a new hire subclass and Plan Sponsor B offers the HRA on the same terms to all participants in the new hire subclass. The minimum class size requirement does not apply to the new hire subclass.
