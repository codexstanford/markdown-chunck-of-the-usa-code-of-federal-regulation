###### ยง 30.22 Bases for compromise.
####### Inability to collect full debt.

(2)The Government is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings.

(i) In determining the Government's ability to enforce collection, the Secretary will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law, and may also consider uncertainty as to the price the collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale.

(ii) A compromise effected under this section should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.
