(b)Federal financial participation is available for payments, which otherwise qualify as money payments with respect to a needy individual, but which are made to a protective payee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The payment must be supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing authorization document for such case or by preparation of a separate authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official showing the name of each eligible individual, the amount of payment authorized and the name of the protective payee. Payrolls must identify protective payment cases either by use of a separate payroll for these cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular payroll.
