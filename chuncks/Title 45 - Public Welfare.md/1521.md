This section contains the full program description of the funding opportunity. It may be as long as needed to adequately communicate to potential applicants the areas in which funding may be provided. It describes the HHS awarding agency's funding priorities or the technical or focus areas in which the HHS awarding agency intends to provide assistance. As appropriate, it may include any program history (whether this is a new program or a new or changed area of program emphasis). This section may communicate indicators of successful projects (if the program encourages collaborative efforts) and may include examples of projects that have been funded previously. This section also may include other information the HHS awarding agency deems necessary, and must at a minimum include citations for authorizing statutes and regulations for the funding opportunity.

This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision about whether to submit a proposal. Relevant information could include the total amount of funding that the HHS awarding agency expects to award through the announcement; the anticipated number of Federal awards; the expected amounts of individual Federal awards (which may be a range); the amount of funding per Federal award, on average, experienced in previous years; and the anticipated start dates and periods of performance for new Federal awards. This section also should address whether applications for renewal or supplementation of existing projects are eligible to compete with applications for new Federal awards.
