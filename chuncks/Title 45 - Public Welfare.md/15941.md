####### Referral.

(2)(i) When a responsive record has originated with a different agency or other Federal Government office that is subject to the FOIA, AmeriCorps refers the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, on the presumption that the agency that originated a record will be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if AmeriCorps and the originating agency jointly agree that AmeriCorps is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever AmeriCorps refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, notify the requester of the referral, and tell the requester the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred and that agency's FOIA contact information.
