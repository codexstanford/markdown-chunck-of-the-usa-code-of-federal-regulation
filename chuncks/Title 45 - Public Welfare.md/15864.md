###### ยง 2506.18 What interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs will I have to pay on a debt owed to the Corporation?
####### Interest.

(a)(1) The Corporation will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.

(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Corporation will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Corporation will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of the Corporation or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. The Corporation will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of the Corporation.

(3) The Chief Executive Officer may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest when he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the Corporation. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review.
