5.means all organized activities of a hospital not immediately related to the patient care, research, and instructional and training functions which produce identifiable revenue from the performance of these activities. If a non-related activity does not produce identifiable revenue, it may be necessary to allocate this expense using an appropriate basis. In such a case, the activity may be included as an allocable cost (See paragraph C.4 below.) Also included under this definition is any category of cost treated as "Unallowable," provided such category of cost identifies a function or activity to which a portion of the institution's indirect cost (as defined in paragraph E.1.) are properly allocable.
