####### Duties of a Navigator.

(e)An entity that serves as a Navigator must carry out at least the following duties:

(1) Maintain expertise in eligibility, enrollment, and program specifications and conduct public education activities to raise awareness about the Exchange;

(2) Provide information and services in a fair, accurate, and impartial manner, which includes: providing information that assists consumers with submitting the eligibility application; clarifying the distinctions among health coverage options, including QHPs; and helping consumers make informed decisions during the health coverage selection process. Such information must acknowledge other health programs;

(3) Facilitate selection of a QHP;

(4) Provide referrals to any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or health insurance ombudsman established under section 2793 of the PHS Act, or any other appropriate State agency or agencies, for any enrollee with a grievance, complaint, or question regarding their health plan, coverage, or a determination under such plan or coverage;

(5) Provide information in a manner that is culturally and linguistically appropriate to the needs of the population being served by the Exchange, including individuals with limited English proficiency, and ensure accessibility and usability of Navigator tools and functions for individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act;

(6) Ensure that applicants-

(i) Are informed, prior to receiving assistance, of the functions and responsibilities of Navigators, including that Navigators are not acting as tax advisers or attorneys when providing assistance as Navigators and cannot provide tax or legal advice within their capacity as Navigators;

(ii) Provide authorization in a form and manner as determined by the Exchange prior to a Navigator's obtaining access to an applicant's personally identifiable information, and that the Navigator maintains a record of the authorization provided in a form and manner as determined by the Exchange. The Exchange must establish a reasonable retention period for maintaining these records. In Federally-facilitated Exchanges, this period is no less than six years, unless a different and longer retention period has already been provided under other applicable Federal law; and

(iii) May revoke at any time the authorization provided the Navigator pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section; and

(7) In a Federally-facilitated Exchange, no individual or entity shall be ineligible to operate as a Navigator solely because its principal place of business is outside of the Exchange service area;

(8) Provide targeted assistance to serve underserved or vulnerable populations, as identified by the Exchange, within the Exchange service area.

(i) In a Federally-facilitated Exchange, this paragraph (e)(8) will apply beginning with the Navigator grant application process for Navigator grants awarded in 2018. The Federally-facilitated Exchange will identify populations as vulnerable or underserved that are disproportionately without access to coverage or care, or that are at a greater risk for poor health outcomes, in the funding opportunity announcement for its Navigator grants, and applicants for those grants will have an opportunity to propose additional vulnerable or underserved populations in their applications for the Federally-facilitated Exchange's approval.

(ii) [Reserved]

(9) The Exchange may require or authorize Navigators to provide information and assistance with any of the following topics. In federally-facilitated Exchanges, FY 2021 Navigator grantees will be required to perform these duties beginning with the Navigator grant funding awarded in FY 2022 for the second 12-month budget period of the 36-month period of performance. Beginning with Navigator grants awarded in 2022, including non-competing continuation awards, Navigators are required to provide information and assistance with all of the following topics:

(i) Understanding the process of filing Exchange eligibility appeals;

(ii) Understanding and applying for exemptions from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage granted through the Exchange;

(iii) The Exchange-related components of the premium tax credit reconciliation process, and understanding the availability of IRS resources on this process;

(iv) Understanding basic concepts and rights related to health coverage and how to use it; and

(v) Referrals to licensed tax advisers, tax preparers, or other resources for assistance with tax preparation and tax advice related to consumer questions about the Exchange application and enrollment process, and premium tax credit reconciliations.
