####### Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

(4)In general, a child's ethnicity is determined by the child or the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s). A child is of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity if the child is a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Indicate whether this category applies with a "yes" or "no." If the child or the child's parent or legal guardian does not know or cannot communicate whether the child is of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, indicate "unknown." If the child was abandoned indicate "abandoned." Abandoned means that the child was left alone or with others and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s)' identity is unknown and cannot be ascertained. This includes a child left at a "safe haven." If the child or the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) refuses to identify the child's ethnicity, indicate "declined."
