##### ยง 284.20 What information will we use to determine the child poverty rate in each State?
###### Estimates from the State.

(c)(1) As an alternative to the Census Bureau estimates provided to the State under paragraph (b) of this section, the State may provide to us data on child poverty in the State derived from an independent source.

(2) If the State provides data on child poverty as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must:

(i) Provide an estimate of the child poverty rate for the same two calendar years as the Census Bureau estimates provided to the State under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(ii) Provide the change in the child poverty rate for the applicable two-calendar-year period at the 90-percent confidence level;

(iii) Use the official definition of poverty as used by the Census Bureau; and

(iv) Describe the methodology used to develop its independent estimates, the sources of data and methodology for collecting the data, any known problems associated with making estimates of this type, the estimate of the standard error, and the power of the sample to detect a five percent change in the child poverty rate.

(3) The State must submit its independent estimates and supporting information within 45 days of the date the State receives the Census Bureau estimates as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
