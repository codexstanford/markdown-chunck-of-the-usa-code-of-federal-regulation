(a) A non-Federal entity may charge to the Federal award only allowable costs incurred during the period of performance (except as described in ยง 75.461) and any costs incurred before the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity made the Federal award that were authorized by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

This deadline may be extended with prior written approval from the HHS awarding agency.
