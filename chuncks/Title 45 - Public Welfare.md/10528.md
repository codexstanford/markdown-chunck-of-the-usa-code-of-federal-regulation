##### ยง 612.7 Exemptions.
###### Exemption 6-5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6).

(6)Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The exemption may apply to protect the privacy of living persons and of living close survivors of a deceased person identified in a record. Information in such files which is not otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to other provisions of this section will be released to the subject or to his designated legal representative, and may be disclosed to others with the subject's written consent. Examples of records exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:

(i) Reports, records, and other materials pertaining to individual cases in which disciplinary or other administrative action has been or may be taken. Opinions and orders resulting from those administrative or disciplinary proceedings shall be disclosed without identifying details if used, cited, or relied upon as precedent;

(ii) Records compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the suitability of candidates for employment, and the eligibility of individuals (civilian or contractor employees) for security clearances, or for access to classified information;

(iii) Reports and evaluations which reflect upon the qualifications or competence of individuals;

(iv) Personal information such as home addresses and telephone and facsimile numbers, private email addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, marital status and the like;

(v) The exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal personal, private information, and the public interest in disclosure is not sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest.
