##### Subpart A - Approval of State Plans and Certification of Grants
###### ยง 201.3 Approval of State plans and amendments.

The State plan consists of written documents furnished by the State to cover each of its programs under the Act: Old-age assistance (title I); aid and services to needy families with children (part A of title IV); aid to the blind (title X); aid to the permanently and totally disabled (title XIV); or aid to the aged, blind or disabled (title XVI). The State may submit the common material on more than one program as an integrated plan. However, it must identify the provisions pertinent to each title since a separate plan must be approved for each public assistance title. A plan submitted under title XVI encompasses, under a single plan, the programs otherwise covered by three separate plans under titles I, X, and XIV. After approval of the original plan by the Administration, all relevant changes, required by new statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions, are required to be submitted currently so that the Administration may determine whether the plan continues to meet Federal requirements and policies.
