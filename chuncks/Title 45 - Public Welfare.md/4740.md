###### ยง 150.221 Transition to State enforcement.

(a) If CMS determines that a State for which it has assumed enforcement authority has enacted and implemented legislation to enforce PHS Act requirements and also determines that it is appropriate to return enforcement authority to the State, CMS will enter into discussions with State officials to ensure that a transition is effected with respect to the following:

(1) Consumer complaints and inquiries.

(2) Instructions to issuers.

(3) Any other pertinent aspect of operations.

(b) CMS may also negotiate a process to ensure that, to the extent practicable, and as permitted by law, its records documenting issuer compliance and other relevant areas of CMS's enforcement operations are made available for incorporation into the records of the State regulatory authority that will assume enforcement responsibility.
