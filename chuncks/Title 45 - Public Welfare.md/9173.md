###### ยง 286.270 What happens if the Tribe does not satisfy the quarterly reporting requirements?

(a) If we determine that a Tribe has not submitted to us a complete and accurate Tribal TANF Data Report within the time limit, the Tribe risks the imposition of a penalty at ยง 286.205 related to the work participation rate targets since the data from the Tribal TANF Data Report is required to calculate participation rates.

(b) Non-reporting of the Tribal TANF Financial Report may give rise to a penalty under ยง 286.200 since this Report is used to demonstrate compliance with provisions of the Act, the provisions of 45 CFR part 75, or any Federal statutes and regulations applicable to the TANF program.
