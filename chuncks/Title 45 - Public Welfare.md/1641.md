###### Bonding costs.

c.

(1) Bonding costs arise when the Government requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others by reason of the act or default of the hospital. They arise also in instances where the hospital requires similar assurance.

Included are such types as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds.

(2) Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms of the research agreement are allowable.

(3) Costs of bonding required by the hospital in the general conduct of its business are allowable to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.
