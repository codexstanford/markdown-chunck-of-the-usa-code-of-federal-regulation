####### Cost-sharing reductions during special periods.

(f)(1) Notwithstanding the cost-sharing reduction reconciliation process described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, a QHP issuer will not be eligible for reimbursement of any cost-sharing reductions provided following a termination of coverage effective date with respect to a grace period as described in ยง 155.430(b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this subchapter.
