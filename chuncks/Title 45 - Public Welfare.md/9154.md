###### ยง 286.205 How will we determine if a Tribe fails to meet the minimum work participation rate(s)?
####### e.g.,

(ii) The data are free from computational errors and are internally consistent (items that should add to totals do so);

(iii) The Tribal TANF grantee reports data on all applicable elements; and

(iv) All expenditures have been made in accordance with 45 CFR part 75.

(4) We will review the data filed in the quarterly reports to determine if they meet these standards. In addition, we will use audits and reviews to verify the accuracy of the data filed by the Tribal TANF grantee.

(c) Tribal TANF grantees must maintain records to adequately support any report, in accordance with 45 CFR part 75.

(d) If we find reports so significantly incomplete or inaccurate that we seriously question whether the Tribe has met its participation rate, we may apply the penalty under ยง 286.195(a)(3).
