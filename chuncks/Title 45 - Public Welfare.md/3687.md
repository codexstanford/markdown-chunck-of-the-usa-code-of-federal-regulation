###### ยง 146.145 Special rules relating to group health plans.
####### Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) and other account-based group health plans.

(viii)Benefits provided under an HRA or other account-based group health plan, other than a health FSA, are excepted if they satisfy all of the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(viii). See paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section for the circumstances in which benefits provided under a health FSA are excepted benefits. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(viii), the term "HRA or other account-based group health plan" has the same meaning as "account-based group health plan" set forth in ยง 147.126(d)(6)(i) of this subchapter, except that the term does not include health FSAs. For ease of reference, an HRA or other account-based group health plan that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(viii) is referred to as an excepted benefit HRA.
