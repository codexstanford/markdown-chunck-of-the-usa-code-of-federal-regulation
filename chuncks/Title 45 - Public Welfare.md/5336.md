(1) The nature and circumstances of the conduct including, but not limited to:

(iv) The length of time of the violation;

(v) The number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

(vi) The extent to which the person received compensation or other consideration associated with the violation;

(vii) Any documentation provided in any complaint or other information, as well as any additional information provided by the individual to refute performing the violation; and

(viii) Whether other remedies or penalties have been imposed for the same conduct or occurrence.

(2) The nature of the harm resulting from, or reasonably expected to result from, the violation, including but not limited to:

(i) Whether the violation resulted in actual or potential financial harm;

(ii) Whether there was actual or potential harm to an individual's reputation;

(iii) Whether the violation hindered or could have hindered an individual's ability to obtain health insurance coverage;

(iv) [Reserved]

(v) The actual or potential impact of the provision of false or fraudulent information or of the improper use or disclosure of the information; and

(3) No penalty will be imposed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section if HHS determines that there was a reasonable cause for the failure to provide correct information required under section 1411(b) of the Affordable Care Act and that the person acted in good faith.
