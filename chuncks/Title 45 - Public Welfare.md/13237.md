######## Source of health care.

(a)(1) A program, within 30 calendar days after the child first attends the program or, for the home-based program option, receives a home visit, must consult with parents to determine whether each child has ongoing sources of continuous, accessible health care-provided by a health care professional that maintains the child's ongoing health record and is not primarily a source of emergency or urgent care-and health insurance coverage.

(2) If the child does not have such a source of ongoing care and health insurance coverage or access to care through the Indian Health Service, the program must assist families in accessing a source of care and health insurance that will meet these criteria, as quickly as possible.
