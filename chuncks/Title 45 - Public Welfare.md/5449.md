####### Recalculation of advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.

(g)(1) When an eligibility redetermination in accordance with this section results in a change in the amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit for the benefit year, the Exchange must:

(i) Recalculate the amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit in such a manner as to account for any advance payments already made on behalf of the tax filer for the benefit year for which information is available to the Exchange, such that the recalculated advance payment amount is projected to result in total advance payments for the benefit year that correspond to the tax filer's total projected premium tax credit for the benefit year, calculated in accordance with 26 CFR 1.36B-3 (or, if less than zero, be set at zero); or

(ii) Recalculate advance payments of the premium tax credit using an alternate method that has been approved by the Secretary.

(2) When an eligibility redetermination in accordance with this section results in a change in cost-sharing reductions, the Exchange must determine an individual eligible for the category of cost-sharing reductions that corresponds to his or her expected annual household income for the benefit year (subject to the special rule for family policies set forth in ยง 155.305(g)(3)).
