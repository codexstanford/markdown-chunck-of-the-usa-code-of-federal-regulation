###### ยง 1148.5 When will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?
####### Unusual circumstances.

(c)Whenever the Arts Endowment cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of "unusual circumstances," as defined in the FOIA, and the Arts Endowment extends the time limit on that basis, the Arts Endowment will, before expiration of the 20 business day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Arts Endowment estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Arts Endowment will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Arts Endowment will make available its designated FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Arts Endowment will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.
