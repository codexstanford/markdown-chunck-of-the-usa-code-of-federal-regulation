a.The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media include magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs, direct mail, exhibits, and the like. The only advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:

(1) The recruitment of persons required for the performance by the institution of obligations arising under the research agreement, when considered in conjunction with all other recruitment costs as set forth in paragraph I.2.hh;

(2) The procurement of scarce items for the performance of the research agreement; or

(3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of the research agreement.

Costs of this nature, if incurred for more than one research agreement or for both research agreement work and other work of the institution, are allowable to the extent that the principles in paragraphs D. and E. are observed.
