bb.

(1) Costs of professional services rendered by the members of a particular profession who are not employees of the hospital are allowable subject to (2) and (3) below when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Government. Retainer fees to be allowable must be reasonably supported by evidence of services rendered.

(2) Factors to be considered in determining the allowability of costs in a particular case include (i) the past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to the award of government research agreements on the institution's total activity; (ii) the nature and scope of managerial services expected of the institution's own organizations; and (iii) whether the proportion of government work to the hospital's total activity is such as to influence the institution in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under government research agreements.

(3) Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in connection with organization and reorganization or the prosecution of claims against the Government are unallowable. Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in connection with patent infringement litigation are unallowable unless otherwise provided for in the research agreement.
