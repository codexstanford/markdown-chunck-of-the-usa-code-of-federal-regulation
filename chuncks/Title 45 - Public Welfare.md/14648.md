Federal funds, however, will not exceed the amount of the Indian Tribe's allotment.

(3) Indian Tribes, by statute, may use the following three Federal sources of funds as matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds.
