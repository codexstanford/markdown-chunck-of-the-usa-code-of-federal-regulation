###### ยง 158.232 Calculating the credibility adjustment.
####### Base credibility factor.

(b)(1) The base credibility factor for fully credible experience or for non-credible experience is zero.

(2) The base credibility factor for partially credible experience is determined based on the number of life-years included in the aggregation, as determined under ยง 158.231 of this subpart, and the factors shown in Table 1. When the number of life-years used to determine credibility exactly matches a life-year category listed in Table 1, the value associated with that number of life-years is the base credibility factor. The base credibility factor for a number of life-years between the values shown in Table 1 is determined by linear interpolation.
