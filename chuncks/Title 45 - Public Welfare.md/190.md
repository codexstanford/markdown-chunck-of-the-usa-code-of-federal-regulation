###### Notification of or access to records in exempt systems of records.

(c)(1) Where a system of records is exempt as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any individual may nonetheless request notification of or access to a record in that system. An individual shall make requests for notification of or access to a record in an exempt system of records in accordance with the procedures of §§ 5b.5 and 5b.6 of this part.

(2) An individual will be granted notification of or access to a record in an exempt system but only to the extent such notification or access would not reveal the identity of a source who furnished the record to the Department under an express promise, and prior to September 27, 1975 an implied promise, that his identity would be held in confidence, if:

(i) The record is in a system of records which is exempt under subsection (k)(2) of the Act and the individual has been, as a result of the maintenance of the record, denied a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible; or,

(ii) The record is in a system of records which is exempt under subsection (k)(5) of the Act.

(3) If an individual is not granted notification of or access to a record in a system of records exempt under subsections (k) (2) and (5) of the Act in accordance with this paragraph, he will be informed that the identity of a confidential source would be revealed if notification of or access to the record were granted to him.
