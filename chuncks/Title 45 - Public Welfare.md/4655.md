####### Conflict of interest mitigation policies.

(3)A potential SDR entity must also provide additional information on the SDR entity's conflict-of-interest policies and procedures, including outlining a mitigation plan in the event of an entity-level conflict of interest, under which no dispute resolution personnel affiliated with the SDR entity can fairly and impartially adjudicate a case, in compliance with the standards in Federal Acquisition Regulation-subpart 9.5 (48 CFR subpart 9.5). Such conflict of interest mitigation plan could include utilizing a subcontractor without a conflict of interest that meets SDR entity requirements to conduct the patient-provider dispute resolution for the case.
