##### ยง 650.11 Utilization reports.

Paragraph (h) of the standard Patent Rights clause set forth in ยง 650.4 obliges grantees "to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization". At this time, the Foundation does not plan to request such reports except in connection with march-in investigations conducted under ยง 650.13. This section will be amended to describe periodic reporting requirements if such are ever established.
