####### Court-ordered retroactive payment

means either a retroactive payment the State makes to an assistance recipient or an individual, under a Federal or State court order or a retroactive payment we make to a State under a Federal court order. Although we may accept these claims as timely, this provision does not mean that we necessarily agree to be bound by a State or Federal decision when we were not a party to the action.
