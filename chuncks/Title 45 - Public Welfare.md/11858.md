###### ยง 1148.5 When will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?
####### Multitrack processing.

(b)The Arts Endowment will designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The Arts Endowment may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Arts Endowment may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Arts Endowment will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.
