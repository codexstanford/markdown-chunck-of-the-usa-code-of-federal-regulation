######## et seq.,et seq.

(9) NEH may offset benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301,), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921,), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than tier two (2) benefits), only in accordance with Treasury regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.

(10) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988's provisions concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from NEH, as the creditor agency, that it has met the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a). NEH's certification in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section will satisfy this requirement. If the Secretary grants such a waiver, only Treasury's Data Integrity Board is required to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
