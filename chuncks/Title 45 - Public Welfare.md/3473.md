####### Conclusion.,Example 7,Example 7

(B)The same terms requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section is satisfied in this paragraph (f)(1)(vii) () because Plan Sponsor F offers the HRA on the same terms to all employees with a work site in State 2 and that class is a permissible class under paragraph (d) of this section. This is because employees whose work sites are in different rating areas may be considered different classes and a plan sponsor may create a class of employees by combining classes of employees, including by combining employees whose work site is in one rating area with employees whose work site is in a different rating area, or by combining all employees whose work site is in a state. The minimum class size requirement does not apply to this paragraph (f)(1)(vii) () because the minimum class size requirement does not apply if the geographic area defining a class of employees is a state or a combination of two or more entire states.
