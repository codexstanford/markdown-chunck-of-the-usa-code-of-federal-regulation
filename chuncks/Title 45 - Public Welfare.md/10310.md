####### Qualified handicapped person

(k)means:

(1) With respect to employment, a handicapped person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question;

(2) With respect to public preschool elementary, secondary, or adult educational services, a handicapped person (i) of an age during which nonhandicapped persons are provided such services, (ii) of any age during which it is mandatory under state law to provide such services to handicapped persons, or (iii) to whom a state is required to provide a free appropriate public education under section 612 of the Education of the Handicapped Act; and

(3) With respect to postsecondary and vocational education services, a handicapped person who meets the academic and technical standards requisite to admission or participation in the recipient's education program or activity;

(4) With respect to other services, a handicapped person who meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of such services.

(5) With respect to scientific and technical experimentation, observation, or field work a person who meets the academic, scientific and technical standards for participation and any reasonable physical qualifications for participation. Physical qualifications are not "reasonable," however, if they can be obviated without unreasonable burden by modifying facilities or aid, benefits, or services or by providing auxiliary aids. In determining whether the burdens are unreasonable, factors such as cost, risks, or sacrifice of legitimate objectives may be considered. In exceptional cases psychological qualifications may be considered 'reasonable physical qualifications' under this paragraph. Nothing in this provision or these regulations requires reversal of scientific judgments on research, including choice of experiments, protocols for experiments, location of observing sites, or the like that are considered necessary to any line of scientific inquiry by the research scientists involved.
