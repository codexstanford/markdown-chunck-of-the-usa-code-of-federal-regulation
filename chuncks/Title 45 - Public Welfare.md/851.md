###### ยง 60.14 Reporting civil judgments related to the delivery of a health care item or service.
####### Who must report.

(a)Federal and state attorneys and health plans must report civil judgments against health care practitioners, providers, or suppliers related to the delivery of a health care item or service (regardless of whether the civil judgment is the subject of a pending appeal). If a government agency is party to a multi-claimant civil judgment, it must assume the responsibility for reporting the entire action, including all amounts awarded to all the claimants, both public and private. If there is no government agency as a party, but there are multiple health plans as claimants, the health plan which receives the largest award must be responsible for reporting the total action for all parties.
