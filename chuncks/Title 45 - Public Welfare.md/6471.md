###### § 158.240 Rebating premium if the applicable medical loss ratio standard is not met.
####### Amount of rebate to each enrollee.

(c)(1) For each MLR reporting year, an issuer must rebate to the enrollee, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the total amount of premium revenue, as defined in § 158.130, received by the issuer from the enrollee, after subtracting Federal and State taxes and licensing and regulatory fees as provided in §§ 158.161(a) and 158.162(a)(1) and (b)(1), and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance as provided in § 158.130(b)(5), multiplied by the difference between the MLR required by § 158.210 or § 158.211, and the issuer's MLR as calculated under § 158.221.

(2) For example, an issuer must rebate a pro rata portion of premium revenue if it does not meet an 80 percent MLR for the individual market in a State that has not set a higher MLR. If an issuer has a 75 percent MLR for the coverage it offers in the individual market in a State that has not set a higher MLR, the issuer must rebate 5 percent of the premium paid by or on behalf of the enrollee for the MLR reporting year after subtracting a pro rata portion of taxes and fees and accounting for payments or receipts related to the reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors programs (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as described in § 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent). If the issuer's total earned premium for the MLR reporting year in the individual market in the State is $200,000, the issuer received transitional reinsurance payments of $2,500, and made net payments related to risk adjustment and risk corridors of $20,000 (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as described in § 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent), the issuer's gross earned premium in the individual market in the State would be $200,000 plus $2,500 minus $20,000, for a total of $182,500. If the issuer's Federal and State taxes and licensing and regulatory fees, including reinsurance contributions, that may be excluded from premium revenue as described in §§ 158.161(a), 158.162(a)(1) and 158.162(b)(1), allocated to the individual market in the State are $15,000, and the net payments related to risk adjustment and risk corridors, reduced by reinsurance receipts, that must be accounted for in premium revenue as described in §§ 158.130(b)(5), 158.221, and 158.240, are $17,500 ($20,000 reduced by $2,500), then the issuer would subtract $15,000 and add $17,500 to gross premium revenue of $182,500, for a base of $185,000 in premium. The issuer would owe rebates of 5 percent of $185,000, or $9,250 in the individual market in the State. In this example, if an enrollee of the issuer in the individual market in the State paid $2,000 in premiums for the MLR reporting year, or 1/100 of the issuer's total premium in that State market, then the enrollee would be entitled to 1/100 of the total rebates owed by the issuer, or $92.50.
