######## Planning APD.

(a)(1) A separate planning effort and Planning APD is optional, but highly recommended, and generally applies to large statewide system developments and/or major hardware acquisitions. States with large, independent counties requesting funding at the regular match rate for county systems are strongly encouraged to engage in planning activities commensurate with the complexity of the projected ADP project and to submit a Planning APD to allow for time and to provide funding for its planning activities. Therefore, States must consider the scope and complexity of a project to determine whether to submit a Planning APD as a separate document to HHS or whether to combine the two phases of planning and implementation into one APD covering both the Planning APD and the Implementation APD requirements.

(2) The Planning APD is a relatively brief document, usually not more than 6-10 pages, which must contain:

(i) A statement of the problem/need that the existing capabilities can not resolve, new or changed program requirements or opportunities for improved economies and efficiencies and effectiveness of program and administration and operations;

(ii) A project management plan that addresses the planning project organization, planning activities/deliverables, State and contractor resource needs, planning project procurement activities and schedule;

(iii) A specific budget for the planning phase of the project;

(iv) An estimated total project cost and a prospective State and Federal cost allocation/distribution, including planning and implementation;

(v) A commitment to conduct/prepare the problem(s) needs assessment, feasibility study, alternatives analysis, cost benefit analysis, and to develop a Functional Requirements Specification and/or a General Systems Design (GSD);

(vi) A commitment to define the State's functional requirements, based on the State's business needs which may be used for the purpose of evaluating the transfer of an existing system, including the transfer of another State's General System Design that the State may adapt to meet State specific requirements;

(vii) Additional Planning APD content requirements, for enhanced funding projects as contained in § 307.15 and §§ 1355.50 through 1355.57; and

(viii) An acquisition summary for the upcoming year or development phase that provides the following information on proposed acquisitions:

(A) Type and scope of contract

(B) Procurement strategy

(C) Estimated cost or not to exceed amount

(D) Timeframe of contract

(E) A statement or certification that the proposed acquisition will comply with all State and Federal requirements including the retention of software ownership rights specified in § 95.617.
