####### Supported employment services.

The term "supported employment services" means services that enable individuals with developmental disabilities to perform competitive work in integrated work settings, in the case of individuals with developmental disabilities for whom competitive employment has not traditionally occurred; or for whom competitive employment has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of significant disabilities; and who, because of the nature and severity of their disabilities, need intensive supported employment services or extended services in order to perform such work.
