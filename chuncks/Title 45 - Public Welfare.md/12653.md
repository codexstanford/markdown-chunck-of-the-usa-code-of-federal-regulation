######## Review Requirements.

(e)(1) For purposes of this section, whenever NEH is required to afford a debtor a review, it will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and NEH determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

(2) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although NEH will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

(3) This section does not require an oral hearing with respect to debt collection systems in which a determination of indebtedness rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and NEH has determined that the review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes.

(4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, NEH will accord the debtor a "paper hearing;" that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.
