###### Prescription drug rebates and other price concessions

means all remuneration received by or on behalf of an issuer, including remuneration received by and on behalf of entities providing pharmacy benefit management services to the issuer, that decrease the costs of a prescription drug covered by the issuer, regardless from whom the remuneration is received (for example, pharmaceutical manufacturer, wholesaler, retail pharmacy, or vendor). Prescription drug rebates and other price concessions include discounts, charge backs or rebates, cash discounts, free goods contingent on a purchase agreement, up-front payments, coupons, goods in kind, free or reduced-price services, grants, or other price concessions or similar benefits to the extent the value of these items reduce costs for the issuer, and excluding bona fide service fees. Prescription drug rebates and other price concessions exclude any remuneration, coupons, or price concessions for which the full value is passed on to the enrollee. Bona fide service fees mean fees paid by a drug manufacturer to an entity providing pharmacy benefit management services to the issuer that represent fair market value for a bona fide, itemized service actually performed on behalf of the manufacturer that the manufacturer would otherwise perform (or contract for) in the absence of the service arrangement, and that are not passed on in whole or in part to a client or customer of an entity, whether or not the entity takes title to the drug.
