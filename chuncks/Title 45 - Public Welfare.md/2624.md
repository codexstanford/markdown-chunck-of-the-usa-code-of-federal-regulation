######## General Systems Design

means a combination of narrative and graphic description of the generic architecture of a system as opposed to the detailed architecture of the system. A general systems design would include a systems diagram and narrative identifying overall logic flow and systems functions; a description of equipment needed (including processing data transmission and storage requirements); a description of other resource requirements which will be necessary to operate the system; a description of system performance requirements; and a description of the physical and organizational environment in which the system will operate including how the system will function within that environment (e.g. how workers will interface with the system).
