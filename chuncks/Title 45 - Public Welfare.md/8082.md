###### ยง 171.202 Privacy exception - When will an actor's practice of not fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use electronic health information in order to protect an individual's privacy not be considered information blocking?
####### Sub-exception-precondition not satisfied.

(b)To qualify for the exception on the basis that State or Federal law requires one or more preconditions for providing access, exchange, or use of electronic health information that have not been satisfied, the following requirements must be met-

(1) The actor's practice is tailored to the applicable precondition not satisfied, is implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner, and either:

(i) Conforms to the actor's organizational policies and procedures that:

(A) Are in writing;

(B) Specify the criteria to be used by the actor to determine when the precondition would be satisfied and, as applicable, the steps that the actor will take to satisfy the precondition; and

(C) Are implemented by the actor, including by providing training on the policies and procedures; or

(ii) Are documented by the actor, on a case-by-case basis, identifying the criteria used by the actor to determine when the precondition would be satisfied, any criteria that were not met, and the reason why the criteria were not met.

(2) If the precondition relies on the provision of a consent or authorization from an individual and the actor has received a version of such a consent or authorization that does not satisfy all elements of the precondition required under applicable law, the actor must:

(i) Use reasonable efforts within its control to provide the individual with a consent or authorization form that satisfies all required elements of the precondition or provide other reasonable assistance to the individual to satisfy all required elements of the precondition; and

(ii) Not improperly encourage or induce the individual to withhold the consent or authorization.

(3) For purposes of determining whether the actor's privacy policies and procedures and actions satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2) above when the actor's operations are subject to multiple laws which have inconsistent preconditions, they shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the paragraphs if the actor has adopted uniform privacy policies and procedures to address the more restrictive preconditions.
