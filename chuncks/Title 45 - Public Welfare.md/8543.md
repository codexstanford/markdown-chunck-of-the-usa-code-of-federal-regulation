##### ยง 233.37 How monthly reports are treated and what notices are required (AFDC).
###### What happens if a completed monthly report is not received by the agency.

(b)An agency may terminate assistance if it has received no report or has received only an incomplete report as defined by the State. In this case, the agency must send the recipient a notice meeting the requirements of ยง 205.10(a)(4)(i)(B) to arrive not later than the date it would have made payment if the agency had received a completed monthly report on time. If the recipient notifies the agency and files a completed report within 10 days of the date of this notice, the agency must accept the replacement form and make a payment based on the information on the form if the information indicates that the person is still eligible (without the applicable earned income disregards if the State agency determines no good cause exists for failing to file a timely report of earnings). If the recipient is found ineligible or eligible for an amount less than the prior month's payment, the State must promptly notify the recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing and his or her right to have assistance reinstated. A recipient has 10 days from the date of the notice to request a hearing in order to receive reinstatement.
