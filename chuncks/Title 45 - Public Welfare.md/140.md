###### ยง 5.53 How does HHS calculate FOIA fees for different categories of requesters?

(a) If you are a commercial use requester, we charge you fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating responsive records.

(b) If you are an educational or noncommercial scientific institution requester, or a member of the news media, you are entitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) without charge. We charge duplication fees after the first 100 pages (or its cost equivalent).
