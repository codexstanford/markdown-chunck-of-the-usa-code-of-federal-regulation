Upon application to the Foundation, a Fellow may seek postponement of his or her fellowship because of ill health or other mitigating circumstances, such as military duty, temporary disability, necessary care of an immediate family member, or unemployment as a teacher. Substantiation of the reasons for the requested postponement of study will be required. All postponements are given at the Foundation's discretion and will normally not extend for more than one year.
