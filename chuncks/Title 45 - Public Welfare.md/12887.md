###### Procedure on decisions by hearing examiner.

(a)If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Director for a final decision, and a copy of the initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. When the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days after the mailing of a notice of initial decision, file with the Director his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Director may, on his own motion, within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. On the filing of the exceptions or of notice of review, the Director shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, shall constitute the final decision of the Director.
