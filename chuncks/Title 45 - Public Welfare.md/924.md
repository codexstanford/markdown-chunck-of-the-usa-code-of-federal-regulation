####### Employee

(a)means an officer or employee of HHS other than a special Government employee and includes Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service who are on active duty, and individuals on assignment or detail to HHS pursuant to the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (5 U.S.C. 3371-3376). The term also includes HHS employees who are detailed to non-Federal or other Federal organizations. At times the term "regular employee" is used in place of "employee" to make a clear distinction between special Government employees and others employed by the Federal government.
