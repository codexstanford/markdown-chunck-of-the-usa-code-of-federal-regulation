##### ยง 237.50 Recipient count, Federal financial participation.

Pursuant to the formulas in sections 3, 403, 1003, 1118, 1121, 1403, and 1603 of the Social Security Act, it is necessary to identify expenditures that may be included in claims for Federal financial participation. The quarterly statement of expenditures and recoveries which is required for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, and AABD must include, as a part of the basis for computing the amount of Federal participation in such expenditures, the number of eligible recipients each month. However, where the State is making claims under section 1118 of the Act or under optional provisions for Federal sharing specified in such paragraphs no recipient count is involved. Vendor payments for medical care may not be considered if the State has a plan approved under title XIX of the Act. The procedures for determining recipient count are set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.
