####### Special rule for co-provider or co-facility substitution.

(2)If a co-provider or co-facility that provided an estimate of the expected charge for an item or service in the good faith estimate is substituted for a different co-provider or co-facility, an item or service billed by the replacement co-provider or co-facility is eligible for dispute resolution if the billed charge is substantially in excess of the total expected charges included in the good faith estimate for the original co-provider or co-facility. If the replacement provider or facility provides the uninsured (or self-pay) individual with a new good faith estimate in accordance with ยง 149.610(b)(2), then the determination of whether an item or service billed by the replacement co-provider or co-facility is eligible for dispute resolution is based on whether the total billed charge for the replacement co-provider or co-facility is substantially in excess of the total expected charges included in the good faith estimate provided by the replacement co-provider or co-facility.
