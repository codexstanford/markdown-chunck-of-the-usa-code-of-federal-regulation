####### Parent or legal guardian information,Year of birth of first parent or legal guardian.

(c)-(1)If applicable, indicate the year of birth of the first parent (biological, legal or adoptive) or legal guardian of the child. To the extent that a child has both a parent and a legal guardian, or two different sets of legal parents, the title IV-E agency must report on those who had legal responsibility for the child. We are not seeking information on putative parent(s) in this paragraph (c)(1). If there is only one parent or legal guardian of the child, that person's year of birth must be reported here. If the child was abandoned indicate "abandoned." "Abandoned" means that the child was left alone or with others and the identity of the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unknown and cannot be ascertained. This includes a child left at a "safe haven."
