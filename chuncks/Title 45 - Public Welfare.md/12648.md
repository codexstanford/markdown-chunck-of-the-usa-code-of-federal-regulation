######## Cecile Industries, Inc.,Cheney,

(ii) The debt arises under a contract as set forth inv.995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

(iii) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, NEH first learns of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When NEH omits prior notice and an opportunity for review, it will give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable, and it will promptly refund any money which it ultimately finds the debtor did not owe to the Government.
