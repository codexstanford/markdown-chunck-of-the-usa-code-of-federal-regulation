##### § 2106.2 Requests for access.
###### CFA action on request.

(c)(1) A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays), except when the Secretary determines otherwise, in which case the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay and an anticipated date by which the request will be answered. When the request can be answered within 10 days, it shall include the following:

(i) A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by CFA;

(ii) A statement as to whether access will be granted only by providing a copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time, alternate arrangements may be made with the official specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

(iii) A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will be the sole means of granting access only when the Secretary has determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of access;

(iv) The amount of fees charged, if any (see §§ 2106.4 and 2106.7); and

(v) The name, title, and telephone number of the CFR official having operational control over the record.
