####### Other financial support.

(45)A youth has other financial support if receiving any other periodic and/or significant financial resources or support from another source not listed in the elements described in paragraphs (g)(41) through (g)(44) of this section as of the date of outcome data collection. Such support can include payments from a spouse or family member (biological, foster or adoptive), child support that the youth receives for him or herself, or funds from a legal settlement. This definition does not include occasional gifts, such as birthday or graduation checks or small donations of food or personal incidentals, child care subsidies, child support for a youth's child, or other financial support which does not benefit the youth directly in supporting himself or herself. Indicate whether the youth is receiving any other financial support with a "yes" or "no." If the youth does not answer this question, indicate "declined." If the youth is not in the baseline or follow-up population this element must be left blank.
