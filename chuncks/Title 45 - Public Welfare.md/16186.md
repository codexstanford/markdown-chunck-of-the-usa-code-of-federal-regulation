###### ยง 2521.60 To what extent must my share of program costs increase over time?

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if your program continues to receive funding after an initial three-year grant period, you must continue to meet the minimum requirements in ยง 2541.45 of this part. In addition, your required share of program costs, including member support and operating costs, will incrementally increase to a 50 percent overall share by the tenth year and any year thereafter that you receive a grant, without a break in funding of five years or more. A 50 percent overall match means that you will be required to match $1 for every $1 you receive from the Corporation.
