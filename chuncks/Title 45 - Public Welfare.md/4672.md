() The median payment amount paid by a plan or issuer for the same or similar service, by a same or similar provider in the geographic area as defined in ยง 149.140(a)(7) where the services were provided, that is reflected in an independent database as defined in ยง 149.140(a)(3) using the methodology described in ยง 149.140(c)(3). When comparing the billed charge with the amounts contained in an independent database, the SDR entity should account for any discounts offered by the provider or facility.

(C) To calculate the final payment determination amount, the SDR entity must add together the amounts to be paid for all items or services subject to the determination. In cases where the final amount determined by the SDR entity is lower than the billed charges, the SDR entity must reduce the total amount determined by the amount paid by the individual for the administrative fee described in paragraph (g) of this section to calculate the final payment determination amount to be paid by the individual for the items or services. Once the final payment determination amount has been calculated, the SDR entity will inform the uninsured (or self-pay) individual and the provider or facility, through the Federal IDR portal, or by electronic or paper mail, of such determination, the determination amount and the SDR entity's justification for making the determination. After such notification is made, the SDR entity will close the case.
