(a) NEH will promptly make a written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, upon a debtor of the United States in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with NEH to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters will depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to NEH's letters or telephone calls. Generally, one demand letter should suffice. In determining the timing of the demand letter(s), NEH will give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to DOJ for litigation, in accordance with ยง 1177.33 or otherwise.
