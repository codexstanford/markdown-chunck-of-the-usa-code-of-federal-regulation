####### § 1177.11 Collection by administrative offset.
######## e.g.,

(6) When an agency has previously given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see§ 1177.10), NEH need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before initiating administrative offset.

(7) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, NEH will certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that:

(i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

(ii) NEH has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.

(8) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary will exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency requests in writing that the Secretary do so. Also, the Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency's written request.
