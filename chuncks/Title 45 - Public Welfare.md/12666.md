####### ยง 1177.24 Joint and several liability.

(a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, NEH will pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. NEH will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

(b) NEH will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.
