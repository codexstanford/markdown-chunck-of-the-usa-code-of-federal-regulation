####### Decisions on appeals.

(c)The Arts Endowment will provide its decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds the Arts Endowment's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for its decision, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Arts Endowment's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the Arts Endowment will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The Arts Endowment will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.
