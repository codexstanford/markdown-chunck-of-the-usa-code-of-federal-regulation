##### § 233.100 Dependent children of unemployed parents.
###### a,b

(iii) Such parent () has six or more quarters of work (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section), within any 13-calendar-quarter period ending within 1 year prior to the application for such aid, or () within such 1-year period, received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or was qualified under the terms of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section) for such compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.

(iv) A "quarter of work" with respect to any individual means a period (of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31) in which he or she received earned income of not less than $50 (or which is a "quarter of coverage" as defined in section 213(a)(2) of the Act), or in which he or she participated in a community work experience program under section 409 of the Act or the work incentive program established under title IV-C of the Act.

(v) An individual shall be deemed "qualified" for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if he would have been eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application, or he performed work not covered by such law which, if it had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him eligible to receive such benefits upon filing application.

(vi)(A) The "parent who is the principal earner" means, in the case of any child, whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent. If the State cannot secure primary evidence of earnings for this period, the State shall designate the principal earner, using the best evidence available. The earnings of each parent are considered in determining the principal earner regardless of when their relationship began. The principal earner so defined remains the principal earner for each consecutive month for which the family receives such aid on the basis of such application. This requirement applies to both new applicants and current AFDC unemployed parent families who were eligible and receiving aid prior to October 1, 1981.

(B) If both parents earned an identical amount of income (or earned no income) in such 24-month period, the State shall designate which parent shall be the principal earner.

(vii) The parent who is the principal earner (unless exempt under § 240.14) has met the requirements for participation in an employment search program under part 240 of this chapter.

(4) Provide for entering into cooperative arrangements with the State agency responsible for administering or supervising the administration of vocational education to assure maximum utilization of available public vocational education services and facilities in the State to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being retrained.

(5) Provide for the denial of such aid to any such dependent child or the relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Act with whom such child is living,

(i) If and for so long as such child's parent, unless exempt under § 224.20, is not currently registered for the work incentive program or if exempt under § 224.20(b)(6), is not currently registered with a public employment office in the State, except that in a State with an approved JOBS plan under § 250.20, such child's parent, unless exempt under § 250.30(b), must be currently participating (or available for participation) in a program under part 250, or, if he is exempt under § 250.30(b)(5), must be registered with a public employment office in the State, and

(ii) With respect to any week for which such child's parent qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of the State or of the United States but refuses to apply for or accept such unemployment compensation, and

(iii) If the parent who is the principal earner (unless exempt under § 240.14) fails to meet the requirements for participation in a program of employment search established under part 240 of this chapter.

(6) Provide that within 30 days after the receipt of such aid, unemployed principal earners will be certified for participation in the Work Incentive program under part 224 or, if the State IV-A agency has an approved JOBS plan pursuant to § 250.20, will participate or apply for participation in a program under part 250 unless the program is not available in the area where the parent is living.
