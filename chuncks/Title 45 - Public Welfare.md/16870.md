###### ยง 2553.91 What legal limitations apply to the operation of the RSVP volunteer Program and to the expenditure of grant funds?
####### Compensation for service.

(c)(1) An agency or organization to which NSSC volunteers are assigned, or which operates or supervises any NSSC program, shall not request or receive any compensation from NSSC volunteers or from beneficiaries for services of NSSC volunteers.

(2) This section does not prohibit a sponsor from soliciting and accepting voluntary contributions from the community at large to meet its local support obligations under the grant or from entering into agreements with parties other than beneficiaries to support additional volunteers beyond those supported by CNCS.

(3) A RSVP volunteer station may contribute to the financial support of the RSVP Program. However, this support shall not be a required precondition for a potential station to obtain RSVP volunteers.

(4) If a volunteer station agrees to provide funds to support additional volunteers or pay for other volunteer support costs, the agreement shall be stated in a written Memorandum of Understanding. The sponsor shall withdraw services if the station's inability to provide monetary or in-kind support to the project under the Memorandum of Understanding diminishes or jeopardizes the project's financial capabilities to fulfill its obligations.

(5) Under no circumstances shall a RSVP volunteer receive a fee for service from service recipients, their legal guardian, members of their family, or friends.
