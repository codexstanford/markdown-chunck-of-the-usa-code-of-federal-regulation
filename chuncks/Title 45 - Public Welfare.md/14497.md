An independent living needs assessment may address knowledge of basic living skills, job readiness, money management abilities, decision-making skills, goal setting, task completion, and transitional living needs. Indicate whether the youth received an independent living needs assessment that was paid for or provided by the State agency during the reporting period with a "yes" or "no" as appropriate. If the youth is not in the served population this element must be left blank.
