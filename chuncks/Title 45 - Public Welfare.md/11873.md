###### ยง 1148.7 How does the Arts Endowment handle confidential commercial information?
####### When notice to submitters is required.

(c)The following rules and procedures determine when the Arts Endowment will provide written notice to submitters of confidential commercial information that their information may be disclosed under FOIA.

(1) The Arts Endowment will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if the Arts Endowment determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) The Arts Endowment has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

(2) The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the Arts Endowment may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.
