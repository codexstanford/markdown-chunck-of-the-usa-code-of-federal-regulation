###### ยง 1148.10 How will fees be charged?
####### Aggregating requests.

(h)When the Arts Endowment reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Arts Endowment may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Arts Endowment may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Arts Endowment will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.
