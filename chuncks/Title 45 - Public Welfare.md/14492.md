####### Local agency.

(15)The local agency is the county or equivalent jurisdictional unit that has primary responsibility for placement and care of a youth who is in foster care consistent with the definition in 45 CFR 1355.20, or that has primary responsibility for providing services to a youth who is not in foster care. Indicate the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code(s) that corresponds to the identity of the county or equivalent unit jurisdiction(s) that meets these criteria during the reporting period. If a youth who is not in foster care is provided services by a centralized unit only, rather than a county agency, indicate "centralized unit." If the youth is not in the served population this element must be left blank.
