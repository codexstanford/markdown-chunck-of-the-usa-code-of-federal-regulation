###### ยง 153.405 Calculation of reinsurance contributions.
####### Multiple group health plans maintained by the same plan sponsor,General rule.

(g)-(1)If a plan sponsor maintains two or more group health plans (including one or more group health plans that provide health insurance coverage) that collectively provide major medical coverage for the same covered lives simultaneously, then those multiple plans must be treated as a single group health plan for purposes of calculating any reinsurance contribution amount due under this section. However, a plan sponsor may treat the multiple plans as separate group health plans for purposes of calculating any reinsurance contribution due under this section if it determines the number of covered lives under each separate group health plan as if the separate group health plan provided major medical coverage.
