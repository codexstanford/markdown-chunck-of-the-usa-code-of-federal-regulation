######## Personal property and use of space.

(g)(1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a non-Federal entity. The value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost.

(2) The value of the donations may be used to meet cost sharing or matching share requirements under the conditions described in §§ 75.300 through 75.309 of subpart D of this part. The value of the donations must be determined in accordance with §§ 75.300 through 75.309. Where donations are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement will not be made.
