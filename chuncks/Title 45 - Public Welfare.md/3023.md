###### § 98.92 Penalties and sanctions.
####### i.e.,

(4)(i) A penalty of five percent of the funds allotted under § 98.61 (the Discretionary Funds) for a Fiscal Year shall be withheld for any Fiscal Year that the Secretary determines that the State, Territory, or Tribe has failed to comply substantially with the criminal background check requirements at § 98.43;

(ii) This penalty will be withheld no earlier than the first full Fiscal Year following the determination to apply the penalty; and

(iii) This penalty will not be applied if the State, Territory, or Tribe corrects the failure before the penalty is to be applied or if it submits a plan for corrective action that is acceptable to the Secretary.

(c) If a Lead Agency is subject to additional sanctions as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, specific identification of any additional sanctions being imposed will be provided in the notice provided pursuant to § 98.91.

(d) Nothing in this section, or in § 98.90 or § 98.91, will preclude the Lead Agency and the Department from informally resolving a possible compliance issue without following all of the steps described in §§ 98.90, 98.91 and 98.92. Penalties and/or sanctions, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may nevertheless be applied, even though the issue is resolved informally.

(e) It is at the Secretary's sole discretion to choose the penalty to be imposed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
