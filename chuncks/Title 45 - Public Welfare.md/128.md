(b)The notice requirements in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the following situations:

(1) We determine that we should withhold the information under a FOIA exemption;

(2) The information has been lawfully published or made available to the public

(3) We are required by a statute (other than the FOIA), or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600, to disclose the information; or

(4) The designation made by the submitter appears obviously frivolous. However, in such a case, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice of any final disclosure determination and intent to release, at least 5 working days prior to the specified disclosure date. We will notify the submitter as referenced in ยง 5.42(a)(3).
