####### Supervised independent living.

(30)Supervised independent living means that the youth is living independently under a supervised arrangement that is paid for or provided by the State agency. A youth in supervised independent living is not supervised 24 hours a day by an adult and often is provided with increased responsibilities, such as paying bills, assuming leases, and working with a landlord, while under the supervision of an adult. Indicate whether the youth was living in a supervised independent living setting that was paid or provided by the State agency during the reporting period with a "yes" or "no" as appropriate. If the youth is not in the served population this element must be left blank.
