####### Calculation rules.

(2)In calculating the median contracted rate, a plan or issuer must:

(i) Calculate the median contracted rate with respect to all plans of such sponsor (or the administering entity as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section, if applicable) or all coverage offered by such issuer that are offered in the same insurance market;

(ii) Calculate the median contracted rate using the full contracted rate applicable to the service code, except that the plan or issuer must-

(A) Calculate separate median contracted rates for CPT code modifiers "26" (professional component) and "TC" (technical component);

(B) For anesthesia services, calculate a median contracted rate for the anesthesia conversion factor for each service code;

(C) For air ambulance services, calculate a median contracted rate for the air mileage service codes (A0435 and A0436); and

(D) Where contracted rates otherwise vary based on applying a modifier code, calculate a separate median contracted rate for each such service code-modifier combination;

(iii) In the case of payments made by a plan or issuer that are not on a fee-for-service basis (such as bundled or capitation payments), calculate a median contracted rate for each item or service using the underlying fee schedule rates for the relevant items or services. If the plan or issuer does not have an underlying fee schedule rate for the item or service, it must use the derived amount to calculate the median contracted rate; and

(iv) Exclude risk sharing, bonus, penalty, or other incentive-based or retrospective payments or payment adjustments.
