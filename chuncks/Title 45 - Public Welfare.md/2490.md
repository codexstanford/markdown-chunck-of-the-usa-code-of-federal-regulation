Any entity to which section 1557 applies (as defined in ยง 92.3 of this part) shall make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the covered entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the health program or activity.
