###### Appendix C to Part 1356 - Calculating Sample Size for NYTD Follow-Up Populations

The Finite Population Correction (FPC) is applied when the sample is drawn from a population of one to 5,000 youth, because the sample is more than five percent of the population.

- (Py)(Pn), an estimate of the percent of responses to a dichotomous variable, is (.50)(.50) for the most conservative estimate.

- Acceptable level of error = .05 (results are plus or minus five percentage points from the actual score)

- Z = 1.645 (90 percent confidence interval)

- N = number of youth from whom the sample is being drawn

The FPC is not applied when the sample is drawn from a population of over 5,000 youth.
