###### Federal financial participation in vendor payments for home repairs.

(c)With respect to expenditures made after December 31, 1967, expenditures to a maximum of $500 are subject to Federal financial participation at 50 percent for repairing the home owned by an individual who is receiving aid or assistance (other than Medical Assistance for the Aged) under a State plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD if:

(1) Prior to making the expenditures the agency determined that: (i) The home is so defective that continued occupancy is unwarranted; (ii) unless repairs are made the recipient would need to move to rental quarters; and (iii) the rental cost of quarters for the recipient (including the spouse living with him in such home and any other individual whose needs were considered in determining the recipient's need) would exceed (over a period of 2 years) the repair costs needed to make such home habitable together with other costs attributable to continued occupancy of such home.

(2) No expenditures for repair of such home were made previously pursuant to a determination as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This does not preclude more than one payment made at the time repairs are made pursuant to the determination, e.g., separate payments to the roofer, the electrician, and the plumber.

(3) Expenditures for home repairs are authorized in writing by a responsible agency person, records show the eligible person in whose behalf the home repair expenditure was made, and there is sufficient evidence that the home repair was performed.
