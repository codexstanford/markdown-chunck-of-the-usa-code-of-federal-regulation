###### ยง 1148.3 How can I make a FOIA request?
####### e.g.,

(2) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Arts Endowment may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
