##### ยง 2530.85 What steps are necessary to revoke a transfer?
###### Used awards.

(c)A revocation may only apply to that portion of the transferred award that has not been used by the designated individual. If the designated individual has used the entire transferred amount prior to the date the Corporation receives the revocation request, no amount will be returned to the transferring individual. An amount is considered to be used when it is disbursed from the National Service Trust, not when a request is received to use an award.
