###### ยง 73.735-904 Resolution of apparent or actual conflicts of interest.

(a) Disqualification from participating in a particular matter or category of matters is an appropriate method for resolving apparent or actual conflicts of interest when the interest or activity giving rise to the problem:

(1) Bears a direct or indirect relationship to particular, identifiable duties of the employee involved; and

(2) Is not so substantial as to affect or give the appearance of affecting the integrity of the services which the Government may expect of the employee. Whenever disqualification is employed to resolve an apparent or actual conflict of interest, the disqualified employee shall sign a written statement reflecting the scope of the disqualification and the precise nature of the conflicting interest or activity. The reviewing official shall keep a file of all such disqualification statements and shall monitor compliance with these statements on a regular basis.
