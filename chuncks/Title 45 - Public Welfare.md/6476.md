Beginning with the 2014 MLR reporting year, any rebate provided in the form of a premium credit must be provided by applying the full amount due to the first month's premium that is due on or after September 30 following the MLR reporting year. If the amount of the rebate exceeds the premium due for October, then any overage shall be applied to succeeding premium payments until the full amount of the rebate has been credited. Beginning with rebates due for the 2020 MLR reporting year, any rebate provided in the form of a premium credit must be provided by applying the full amount due to the monthly premium that is due no later than October 30 following the MLR reporting year. If the amount of the rebate exceeds the monthly premium, then any overage shall be applied to succeeding premium payments until the full amount of the rebate has been credited.
