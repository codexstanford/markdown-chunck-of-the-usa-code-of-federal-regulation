####### Multitrack processing.

(b)AmeriCorps processes requests in a multitrack system based on the date of receipt, the amount of work and time involved in processing the request, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing. This multitrack processing system does not lessen the Agency's responsibility to process requests as quickly as possible.

(1) AmeriCorps uses three tracks:

(i) A track for simple requests that can be processed in 20 working days;

(ii) A track for complex requests that require more than 20 working days; and

(iii) A track for expedited processing.

(2) Within each track, processing will ordinarily proceed on a "first-in, first-out" basis, and rank-ordered by the date of receipt of the request, unless there are unusual circumstances as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, or the requester is entitled to expedited processing as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

(3) If a request does not qualify as simple, AmeriCorps may give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request in order to qualify for faster processing.
