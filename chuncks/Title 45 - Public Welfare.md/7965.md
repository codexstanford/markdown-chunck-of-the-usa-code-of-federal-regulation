####### Corrective action plan and procedures.

(d)(1) When an ONC-ACB determines, through surveillance under this section or otherwise, that a Health IT Module does not conform to the requirements of its certification, the ONC-ACB must notify the developer of its findings and require the developer to submit a proposed corrective action plan for the applicable certification criterion, certification criteria, or certification requirement.

(2) The ONC-ACB shall provide direction to the developer as to the required elements of the corrective action plan.

(3) The ONC-ACB shall verify the required elements of the corrective action plan, consistent with its accreditation and any elements specified by the National Coordinator. At a minimum, any corrective action plan submitted by a developer to an ONC-ACB must include:

(i) A description of the identified non-conformities or deficiencies;

(ii) An assessment of how widespread or isolated the identified non-conformities or deficiencies may be across all of the developer's customers and users of the certified Health IT Module;

(iii) How the developer will address the identified non-conformities or deficiencies, both at the locations under which surveillance occurred and for all other potentially affected customers and users;

(iv) How the developer will ensure that all affected and potentially affected customers and users are alerted to the identified non-conformities or deficiencies, including a detailed description of how the developer will assess the scope and impact of the problem, including identifying all potentially affected customers; how the developer will promptly ensure that all potentially affected customers are notified of the problem and plan for resolution; how and when the developer will resolve issues for individual affected customers; and how the developer will ensure that all issues are in fact resolved.

(v) The timeframe under which corrective action will be completed.

(vi) An attestation by the developer that it has completed all elements of the approved corrective action plan.

(4) When the ONC-ACB receives a proposed corrective action plan (or a revised proposed corrective action plan), the ONC-ACB shall either approve the corrective action plan or, if the plan does not adequately address the elements described by paragraph (d)(3) of this section and other elements required by the ONC-ACB, instruct the developer to submit a revised proposed corrective action plan.
