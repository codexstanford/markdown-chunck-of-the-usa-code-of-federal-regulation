###### Traditional foster care

means a type of care provider facility where a UC is placed with a family in a community-based setting.

The UC attends public school and receives on-going case management and counseling services. The care provider facility facilitates the provision of additional psychiatric, psychological, or counseling referrals as needed. Traditional foster care may include transitional or short-term foster care as well as long-term foster care providers.
