####### Decisions on appeals.

(g)The FOIA Appeals Officer will provide the decision on any appeal in writing within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date the FOIA Appeals Officer received the appeal. The FOIA Appeals Officer's determination of an appeal constitutes the Agency's final action.

(1) If the FOIA Appeals Officer's decision upholds the Agency's determination, the decision will:

(i) State the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied;

(ii) Notify the requester of their statutory right to file a lawsuit; and

(iii) Inform the requester of the mediation services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

(2) If the FOIA Appeals Officer's decision remands or modifies the Agency determination, either in whole or in part, they will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Thereafter, AmeriCorps will re-process the FOIA request in accordance with that determination and, if applicable, promptly send the releasable records to the requester, unless a reasonable delay is justified.
