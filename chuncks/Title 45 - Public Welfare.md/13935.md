(c)(1) A recipient shall be given an initial written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the suspension or termination of financial assistance except in emergency situations, which occur when Federal property is in imminent danger of dissipation, or when life, health, or safety is endangered. During this period of time, the recipient has the opportunity to show cause to ANA why such action should not be taken.

(2) A recipient who has received final written notice of termination or denial of refunding, or whose financial assistance will be suspended for more than 30 days, or who has other appealable disputes with ANA as provided by 45 CFR part 16 may request review by the Departmental Grant Appeals Board under the provisions of 45 CFR part 16.

(3) If a recipient appeals a suspension of more than 30 days which subsequently results in termination of financial assistance, both actions may be considered simultaneously by the Departmental Grant Appeals Board.
