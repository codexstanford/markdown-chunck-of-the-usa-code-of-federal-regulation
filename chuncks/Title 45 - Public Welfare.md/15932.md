###### ยง 2507.6 Requirements for FOIA requests.
####### Third-party requests.

(d)When a request for records pertains to a third party (that is, a person other than the requester), the requester may receive greater access by submitting a notarized authorization signed by the third party or a declaration, made in compliance with the requirements set forth in the FOIA, that the third party authorizes disclosure of the records to the requester, or proof that the third party is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or a published obituary). If necessary, AmeriCorps may require additional information from a requester to verify that the third party consents to disclosure. Alternatively, requesters may demonstrate an overriding public interest in the disclosure of information pertaining to a third party (for example, by producing evidence that alleged Government impropriety occurred, necessitating a disclosure of information related to official misconduct).
