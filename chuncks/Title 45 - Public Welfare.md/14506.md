####### Mentoring.

(29)Mentoring means that the youth has been matched with a screened and trained adult for a one-on-one relationship that involves the two meeting on a regular basis. Mentoring can be short-term, but it may also support the development of a long-term relationship. While youth often are connected to adult role models through school, work, or family, this service category only includes a mentor relationship that has been facilitated, paid for or provided by the State agency or its staff. Indicate whether the youth received mentoring services that were paid for or provided by the State agency during the reporting period with a "yes" or "no" as appropriate. If the youth is not in the served population this element must be left blank.
