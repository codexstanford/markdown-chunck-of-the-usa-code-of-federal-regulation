In circumstances where the Exchange determines that such pre-enrollment special enrollment period verification may cause undue burden on qualified individuals, the Exchange may provide an exception to the pre-enrollment special enrollment period verification process, provided it does so in a manner consistent with the non-discrimination requirements under ยง 155.120(c). Exchanges on the Federal platform will conduct pre-enrollment special enrollment verification of eligibility only for special enrollment periods under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
