###### ยง 30.22 Bases for compromise.
####### Cost of collection.

(3)The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.

(i) The Secretary may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise of such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigation costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts.

(ii) In determining whether the costs of collection justify enforced collection of the full amount, the Secretary will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principal, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.
