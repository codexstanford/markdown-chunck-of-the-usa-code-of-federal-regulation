###### Employment practices.

(c)(1) When a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under the program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). A recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under a program are those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.

(2) Federal financial assistance to programs under laws funded or administered by ACTION which have as a primary objective the providing of employment include those set forth in Appendix B to this part.

(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude persons from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this part applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the recipient to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of beneficiaries.

(d) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program to which this part applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of title VI of this part.
