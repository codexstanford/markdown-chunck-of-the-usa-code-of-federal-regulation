####### Required Methods for Providing Good Faith Estimates for Uninsured (or Self-Pay) Individuals.

(e)(1) A good faith estimate must be provided in written form either on paper or electronically, pursuant to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual's requested method of delivery, and within the timeframes described in paragraph (b) of this section. Good faith estimates provided electronically must be provided in a manner that the uninsured (or self-pay) individual can both save and print. A good faith estimate must be provided and written using clear and understandable language and in a manner calculated to be understood by the average uninsured (or self-pay) individual.

(2) To the extent that an uninsured (or self-pay) individual requests a good faith estimate in a method other than paper or electronically (for example, by phone or orally in person), the convening provider may orally inform the uninsured (or self-pay) individual of information contained in the good faith estimate using the method requested by the uninsured (or self-pay) individual; however, in order for a convening provider or convening facility to meet the requirements of this section, the convening provider or convening facility must issue the good faith estimate to the uninsured (or self-pay) individual in written form as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
