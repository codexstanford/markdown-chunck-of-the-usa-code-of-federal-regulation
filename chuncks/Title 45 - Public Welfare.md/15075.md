###### See

(f) A recovery of an excess fund balance pursuant to this part does not constitute a termination under 45 CFR part 1606.ยง 1606.2(c)(2)(ii).

(g) One-time and special purpose grants awarded by the Corporation are not subject to the fund balance policy set forth in this part. Revenue and expenses relating to such grants shall be reflected separately in the audit report submitted to the Corporation. This may be done by establishing a separate fund or by providing a separate supplemental schedule of revenue and expenses related to such grants as a part of the audit report. No funds provided under a one-time or special purpose grant may be expended subsequent to the expiration date of the grant without the prior written approval of the Corporation. Absent approval from the Corporation, all unexpended funds under such grants shall be returned to the Corporation.
