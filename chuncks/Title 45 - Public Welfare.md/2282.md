(ii) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 238n(b), entities to which this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) applies shall not, for the purposes of granting a legal status to a health care entity (including a license or certificate), or providing such entity with financial assistance, services, or benefits, fail to deem accredited any postgraduate physician training program that would be accredited but for the accrediting agency's reliance upon accreditation standards that require an entity to perform an induced abortion or that require an entity to require, provide, or refer for training in the performance of induced abortions or make arrangements for such training, regardless of whether such standards provide exceptions or exemptions. Entities to which this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) applies and which are involved in such matters shall formulate such regulations or other mechanisms, or enter into such agreements with accrediting agencies, as are necessary to comply with this paragraph.
