####### Procedures for counting covered lives for group health plans with a self-insured coverage option and an insured coverage option.

(f)(1) To determine the number of covered lives of reinsurance contribution enrollees under a group health plan with a self-insured coverage option and an insured coverage option for a benefit year, a plan must use one of the methods specified in either paragraph (d)(1) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1), a plan with multiple coverage options may use any of the counting methods specified for self-insured coverage or insured coverage, as applicable to each option, if it determines the number of covered lives under each option separately as if each coverage option provided major medical coverage (not including any coverage option that consists solely of excepted benefits as defined by section 2791(c) of the PHS Act, that only provides benefits related to prescription drugs, or that is a health reimbursement arrangement, health savings account, or health flexible spending arrangement).
