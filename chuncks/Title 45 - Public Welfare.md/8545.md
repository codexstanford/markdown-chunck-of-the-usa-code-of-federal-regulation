##### § 233.38 Waiver of monthly reporting and retrospective budgeting requirements; AFDC.

(a) States may request waivers of the requirements at §§ 233.31-233.37 to promote compatibility with monthly reporting and budgeting requirements of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 as amended.

(b) The Secretary will not approve requests for waivers unless the information documenting the need for the waiver shows that the waiver would simplify administration of both programs and would not result in a net cost to the Federal government. Approvals for waivers will be for periods up to one year, after which time the State may request an extension of the waiver.

(c) Any decision by the Secretary not to approve a request for a waiver is not appealable.
