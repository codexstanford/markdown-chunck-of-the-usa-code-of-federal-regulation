####### Intellectual property.

(C)A health IT developer may prohibit or restrict communications that involve the use or disclosure of intellectual property existing in the developer's health IT (including third-party intellectual property), provided that any prohibition or restriction imposed by a developer must be no broader than necessary to protect the developer's legitimate intellectual property interests and consistent with all other requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. A restriction or prohibition is deemed broader than necessary and inconsistent with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if it would restrict or preclude a public display of a portion of a work subject to copyright protection (without regard to whether the copyright is registered) that would reasonably constitute a "fair use" of that work.
