######## Suspension, termination, and denial of funding.

(b)Procedures for and definitions of suspension and termination of financial assistance are published in 45 CFR 75.371 through 75.380. Appeals from a denial of refunding will be treated the same procedurally as appeals to termination of financial assistance. The term "denial of refunding" does not include policy decisions to eliminate one or more activities of an approved project. A decision not to fund an application at the end of the recipients's project period is not a "denial of refunding" and is not subject to appeal.
