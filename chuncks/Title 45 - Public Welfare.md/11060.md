###### General.

(a)The Presiding Officer shall admit all evidence which is not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable or of little probative value. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, evidence relating to settlement which would be excluded in the federal courts under Ru1e 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is inadmissible. In the presentation, admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the Presiding Officer shall preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets and other commercial and financial information. The confidential or trade secret status of any information shall not, however, preclude its introduction into evidence. The Presiding Officer may review such evidence in camera, and issue appropriate protective orders.
