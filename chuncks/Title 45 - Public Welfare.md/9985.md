###### ยง 410.301 Sponsors to whom ORR releases an unaccompanied alien child.

(a) ORR releases a UAC to an approved sponsor without unnecessary delay, but may continue to retain custody of a UAC if ORR determines that continued custody is necessary to ensure the UAC's safety or the safety of others, or that continued custody is required to secure the UAC's timely appearance before DHS or the immigration courts.

(b) When ORR releases a UAC without unnecessary delay to an approved sponsor, it releases in the following order of preference:

(1) A parent;

(2) A legal guardian;

(3) An adult relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or grandparent);

(4) An adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian as capable and willing to care for the UAC's well-being in:

(i) A declaration signed under penalty of perjury before an immigration or consular officer; or

(ii) Such other document that establishes to the satisfaction of ORR, in its discretion, the affiant's parental relationship or guardianship;

(5) A licensed program willing to accept legal custody; or

(6) An adult individual or entity seeking custody, in the discretion of ORR, when it appears that there is no other likely alternative to long term custody, and family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility.
