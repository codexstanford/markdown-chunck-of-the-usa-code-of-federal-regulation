###### ยง 1148.4 How will the Arts Endowment respond to my request?
####### Referral.

(2)(i) When the Arts Endowment believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Arts Endowment typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Arts Endowment and the originating agency jointly agree that the Arts Endowment is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever the Arts Endowment refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
