(a) A program must ensure volunteers have been screened for appropriate communicable diseases in accordance with state, tribal or local laws. In the absence of state, tribal, or local law, the Health Services Advisory Committee must be consulted regarding the need for such screenings.

(1) All volunteers in classrooms or working directly with children other than their own must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, other than those volunteers:

(i) For whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated;

(ii) For whom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination; or

(iii) Who are legally entitled to an accommodation with regard to the COVID-19 vaccination requirements based on an applicable Federal law.

(2) Those granted an accommodation outlined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing for current infection at least weekly with those who have negative test results to remain in the classroom or work directly with children. Those with positive test results must be immediately excluded from the facility, so they are away from children and staff until they are determined to no longer be infectious.

(b) A program must ensure children are never left alone with volunteers.
