####### Conclusion.,Example 17

(B)The same terms requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section is satisfied in this paragraph (f)(1)(xvii) () because Plan Sponsor M offers the HRA on the same terms to its part-time employees who are not students and because the part-time student employees offered a student premium reduction arrangement (and their varying HRAs) are not taken into account as part-time employees for purposes of determining whether a class of employees is offered an HRA on the same terms.
