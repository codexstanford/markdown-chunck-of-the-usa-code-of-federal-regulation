###### ยง 155.340 Administration of advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.
####### Allocation of advance payments of the premium tax credit among policies offered through a Federally-facilitated Exchange.

(f)If one or more advance payments of the premium tax credit are to be made on behalf of a tax filer (or two tax filers covered by the same plan(s)), and individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled in more than one QHP or stand-alone dental plan offered through a Federally-facilitated Exchange, then that portion of the advance payment of the premium tax credit that is less than or equal to the aggregate adjusted monthly premiums, as defined in 26 CFR 1.36B-3(e), properly allocated to EHB for the QHP policies, will be allocated among the QHP policies, as described in ยง 155.340(f)(1); and any remaining advance payment of the premium tax credit will be allocated among the stand-alone dental policies based on the methodology described in ยง 155.340(f)(2).

(1) That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit to be allocated among QHP policies will be allocated based on the number of enrollees covered under the QHP, weighted by the age of the enrollees, using the default uniform age rating curve established by the Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR 147.102(e), with the portion allocated to any single QHP policy not to exceed the portion of the QHP's adjusted monthly premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a QHP under this subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same QHP's adjusted monthly premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated evenly among all other QHPs in which individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled.

(2) That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit to be allocated among stand-alone dental policies will be allocated based on the number of enrollees covered under the stand-alone dental policy, weighted by the age of the enrollees, using the default uniform age rating curve established by the Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR 147.102(e), with the portion allocated to any single stand-alone dental policy not to exceed the portion of the stand-alone dental policy premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a stand-alone dental policy under this subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same policy's premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated evenly among all other stand-alone dental policies in which individuals in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled.
