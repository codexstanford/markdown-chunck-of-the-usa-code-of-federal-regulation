Section 16.3(c) of this title mandates an appellant to exhaust any preliminary appeal process required by regulation before a formal appeal to the Board will be allowed. Paragraph (d) of this section provides an informal preliminary appeal process for resolution of such disputes within ORR prior to appeal to the Board.
