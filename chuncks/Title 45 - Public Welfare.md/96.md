###### ยง 5.24 How does HHS process my FOIA request?
####### Perfected requests.,i.e.,

(b)(1) A request is considered to be perfected (the 20 working day statutory response time begins to run) when-

(i) The request either has been received by the responsible FOIA office, or, in any event, not later than 10 working days after the request has been received by any HHS FOIA office;

(ii) The requested records are reasonably described; and

(iii) The request contains sufficient information to enable the FOIA office to contact you and transmit records to you.

(2) We provide at least 20 working days for you to respond to a request to perfect your request, after notification. Requests must reasonably describe the records sought and contain sufficient information to enable the FOIA office to contact you and transmit records to you. If we determine that a request does not meet these requirements, we will attempt to contact you if possible. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, we reserve the right to administratively close the FOIA request.
