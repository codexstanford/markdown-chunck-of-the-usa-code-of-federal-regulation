######## Disposition.

(e)When original or replacement equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a HHS awarding agency, except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or HHS awarding agency disposition instructions, the non-Federal entity must request disposition instructions from the HHS awarding agency if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with HHS awarding agency disposition instructions:

(1) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or less may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the HHS awarding agency.

(2) Except as provided in ยง 75.319(b), or if the HHS awarding agency fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current per-unit fair-market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained by the non-Federal entity or sold. The HHS awarding agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the HHS awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase. If the equipment is sold, the HHS awarding agency may permit the non-Federal entity to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.

(3) The non-Federal entity may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the non-Federal entity must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

(4) In cases where a non-Federal entity fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the HHS awarding agency may direct the non-Federal entity to take disposition actions.
