(b)Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, an issuer must meet its obligation to provide any rebate to persons covered under a group health plan by providing it to the policyholder.

(1) In the case of a policyholder that is a non-Federal governmental group health plan, the policyholder must use the amount of the rebate that is proportionate to the total amount of premium paid by all subscribers under the policy, for the benefit of subscribers in one of the following ways, at the option of the policyholder:

(i) For all subscribers covered under any option offered under the policyholder's group health plan at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder, to reduce the subscribers' portion of premium for the subsequent policy year;

(ii) For subscribers covered, at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder, under the group health plan option for which the issuer is providing a rebate, to reduce the subscribers' portion of premium for the subsequent policy year;

(iii) A cash refund to subscribers of the group health plan option for which the issuer is providing a rebate, who were enrolled in the group health plan option either during the MLR reporting year that resulted in the issuer providing the rebate or at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder;

(iv) The reduction in future premium or the cash refund provided under paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section may, at the option of the policyholder, be: Divided evenly among such subscribers; divided based on each subscriber's actual contributions to premium; or apportioned in a manner that reasonably reflects each subscriber's contributions to premium; and

(v) All rebate distributions made under paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section must be made within 3 months of the policyholder's receipt of the rebate. Rebate distributions made after 3 months must include late payment interest at the current Federal Reserve Board lending rate or 10 percent annually, whichever is higher, on the total amount of the rebate, accruing from the date payment was due under this section.

(2) In the case of a policyholder that is a non-Federal governmental group health plan, the portion of a rebate based upon former subscribers' contributions to premium must be aggregated and used for the benefit of current subscribers in the group health plan in any manner permitted by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
