####### ยง 75.502 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
######## Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at IHEs.

(c)When loans are made to students of an IHE but the IHE does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period must be considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
