##### § 1080.6 Funding of alternative organizations.

(a) If a State does not apply for or submits an approvable application for a grant under the Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program, the Secretary shall use the amounts that would have been allocated to that State to make grants to agencies and organizations in the State that meet the requirements of § 1080.5(b)(1).

(b) The amounts allocated under this section in any fiscal year shall be awarded to eligible agencies and organizations in the same proportion as funds distributed to those agencies and organizations by the State for the previous fiscal year under the Community Services Block Grant Program (42 U.S.C. 9904(c)(2)(A)).

(c) Agencies and organizations eligible to be funded under this section shall submit an application meeting the requirements of §§ 1080.5(a) and 1080.5(b)(2), (3), (5), (6) and (7), at a time specified by the Secretary. If such an agency or organization does not apply for or submit an approvable application under this section, the funds that would have been allocated to them shall be reallocated by the Secretary to the remaining eligible agencies and organizations on a pro rata basis.
