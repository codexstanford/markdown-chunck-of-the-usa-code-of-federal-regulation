###### § 158.240 Rebating premium if the applicable medical loss ratio standard is not met.
####### Limitation on total rebate payable for each year in the aggregation.

(d)For any State and market, an issuer may elect to limit the amount of rebate payable for the MLR reporting year to the issuer's total outstanding rebate liability with respect to all years included in the aggregation. If an issuer elects this option, the outstanding rebate liability with respect to a specific year in the aggregation must be calculated by multiplying the denominator with respect to that year, as defined in § 158.221(c), by the difference between the MLR required by § 158.210 or § 158.211 for the MLR reporting year, and the sum of the issuer's preliminary MLR for that year, as defined under § 158.232(f), and the credibility adjustment applicable to the current MLR reporting year. The outstanding rebate liability with respect to a specific year must be reduced by any rebate payments applied against it in prior MLR reporting years. A rebate paid for an MLR reporting year must be applied first to reduce the outstanding rebate liability with respect to the earliest year in the aggregation.
