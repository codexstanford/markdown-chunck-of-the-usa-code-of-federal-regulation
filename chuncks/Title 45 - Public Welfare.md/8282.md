###### State plan requirements.

(a)A State plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act shall provide that (1) procedures are in effect to ensure that no undue delays occur in issuing a replacement check; and (2) when applicable, prior to the issuance of a replacement check, the State agency must:

(i) Issue a stop payment order on the original AFDC check through appropriate banking procedures; and

(ii) Require recipients to execute a signed statement attesting to the nonreceipt, loss, or theft of the original FDC check. However, if obtaining such a statement from the recipient will cause the issuance of the check to be unduly delayed, the statement may be obtained within a reasonable time after the check is issued.
