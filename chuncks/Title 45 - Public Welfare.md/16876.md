###### ยง 2553.92 What legal coverage does CNCS make available to RSVP volunteers?

It is within CNCS' discretion to determine if Counsel is employed and counsel fees, court costs, bail and other expenses incidental to the defense of an RSVP volunteer are paid in a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding, when such a proceeding arises directly out of performance of the volunteer's activities. The circumstances under which CNCS may pay such expenses are specified in 45 CFR part 1220.
