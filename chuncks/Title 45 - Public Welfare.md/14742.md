###### The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure:

(iii)Whether disclosure of the requested records will contribute to "public understanding." The disclosure must contribute to a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the personal interest of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. LSC shall presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
