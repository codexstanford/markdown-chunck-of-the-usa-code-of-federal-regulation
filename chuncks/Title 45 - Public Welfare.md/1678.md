###### Specialized service facilities operated by a hospital.

ll.

(1) The costs of institutional services involving the use of highly complex and specialized facilities such as electronic computers and reactors are allowable provided the charges therefor meet the conditions of (2) or (3) below, and otherwise take into account any items of income or federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under paragraph C.5.

(2) The costs of such hospital services normally will be charged directly to applicable research agreements based on actual usage or occupancy of the facilities at rates that (i) are designed to recover only actual costs of providing such services, and (ii) are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis as between organized research and other work of the hospital including commercial or accommodation sales and usage by the hospital for internal purposes. This would include use of such facilities as radiology, laboratories, maintenance men used for a special purpose, medical art, photography, etc.

(3) In the absence of an acceptable arrangement for direct costing as provided in (2) above, the costs incurred for such institutional services may be assigned to research agreements as indirect costs, provided the methods used achieve substantially the same results. Such arrangements should be worked out in coordination with all government users of the facilities in order to assure equitable distribution of the indirect costs.
