(g)An issuer may choose to pay a portion or all of its estimated rebate amount for a given MLR reporting year to enrollees in any form specified in § 158.241 prior to the rebate payment deadlines set forth in §§ 158.240(e) and 158.241(a)(2) and in advance of submitting the MLR report required in § 158.110 to the Secretary. Issuers that choose to prepay a portion or all of their rebates must do so for all eligible enrollees in a given state and market in a non-discriminatory manner, and consistently with State law or other applicable state authority. If, after submitting the MLR report required in § 158.110, an issuer determines that its rebate prepayment amount in a given state and market is at least 95 percent, but less than 100 percent, of the total rebate amount owed for the applicable MLR reporting year to enrollees in that state and market, the issuer may, without penalty or late payment interest under paragraph (f) of this section, provide the remaining rebate amount to those enrollees no later than the rebate deadlines in §§ 158.240(e) and 158.241(a)(2) applicable to the following MLR reporting year. If the total rebate owed to an enrollee for the MLR reporting year is above thethreshold established in § 158.243(a), the issuer cannot treat the remaining rebate owed to an enrollee after prepayment aseven if the remaining rebate is below thethreshold.
