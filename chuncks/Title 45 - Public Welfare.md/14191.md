####### Year of birth of second parent or legal guardian.

(2)If applicable, indicate the year of birth of the second parent (biological, legal or adoptive) or legal guardian of the child. We are not seeking information on putative parent(s) in this paragraph (c)(2). If the child was abandoned, indicate "abandoned." "Abandoned" means that the child was left alone or with others and the identity of the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unknown and cannot be ascertained. This includes a child left at a "safe haven." Indicate "not applicable" if there is not another parent or legal guardian.
