## Chapter I - Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Secretary
### PART 5 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS AND INFORMATION
#### Subpart B - Privacy Act
##### ยง 5.30 Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.
###### Court of competent jurisdiction.

(d)It is the view of DHS that under the Privacy Act the Federal Government has not waived sovereign immunity, which precludes state court jurisdiction over a Federal agency or official. Therefore, DHS will not honor state court orders as a basis for disclosure, unless DHS does so under its own discretion.
