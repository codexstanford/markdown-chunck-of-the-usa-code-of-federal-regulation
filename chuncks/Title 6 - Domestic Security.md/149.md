###### Court-ordered disclosures.

(a)When the component discloses an individual's information covered by a system of records pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order is a matter of public record, the Privacy Act requires the component to send a notice of the disclosure to the last known address of the person whose record was disclosed. Notice will be given within a reasonable time after the component's receipt of the order, except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice will be given only after the order becomes public. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice will not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.
