### PART 29 - PROTECTED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION
#### ยง 29.8 Disclosure of PCII.
##### Disclosure of information to appropriate entities or to the general public.

(e)PCII may be used to prepare advisories, alerts, and warnings to relevant companies, targeted sectors, governmental entities, ISAOs, or the general public regarding potential threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure as appropriate pursuant to the CII Act. Unless exigent circumstances require otherwise, any such warnings to the general public will be authorized by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director, the Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security of CISA, or the Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity of CISA. Such exigent circumstances exist only when approval of the Secretary, the Director, the Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security for CISA, or the Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity for CISA cannot be obtained within a reasonable time necessary to issue an effective advisory, alert, or warning. In issuing advisories, alerts, and warnings, DHS will consider the exigency of the situation, the extent of possible harm to the public or to critical infrastructure, and the necessary scope of the advisory, alert, or warning; and take appropriate actions to protect from disclosure any information that is proprietary, business sensitive, relates specifically to or might be used to identify the submitting person or entity or any persons or entities on whose behalf the CII was submitted, or is not otherwise appropriately in the public domain. Depending on the exigency of the circumstances, DHS may consult or cooperate with the submitter in making such advisories, alerts, or warnings.
