##### Validation of information.

(e)(1) The PCII Program Manager is responsible for reviewing all submissions that request protection under the CII Act. The PCII Program Manager will review the submitted information as soon as practicable. If a final determination is made that the submitted information meets the requirements for protection, the PCII Program Manager must ensure that the information has been marked as required in paragraph (c) of this section, notify the submitting person or entity of the determination, and disclose it only pursuant to ยง 29.8.

(2) If the PCII Program Office makes an initial determination that the information submitted does not meet the requirements for protection under the CII Act, the PCII Program Office will:

(i) Notify the submitting person or entity of the initial determination that the information is not considered to be PCII. This notification also will, as necessary:

(A) Request that the submitting person or entity complete the requirements of ยง 29.5(a) or further explain the nature of the information and the submitting person or entity's basis for believing the information qualifies for protection under the CII Act;

(B) Advise the submitting person or entity that the PCII Program Office will review any further information provided before rendering a final determination;

(C) Advise the submitting person or entity that the submission can be withdrawn at any time before a final determination is made;

(D) Notify the submitting person or entity that until a final determination is made the submission will be treated as PCII;

(E) Notify the submitting person or entity that any response to the notification must be received by the PCII Program Office no later than thirty calendar days after the date of the notification; and

(F) Request the submitting person or entity to state whether, in the event the PCII Program Office makes a final determination that any such information is not PCII, the submitting person or entity prefers that the information be maintained without the protections of the CII Act, returned to the submitting person or entity, or destroyed. If a request for return is made, all such information will be returned to the submitting person or entity.

(ii) If the information submitted has not been withdrawn by the submitting person or entity, the PCII Program Office will return the information to the submitter in accordance with the submitting person or entity's written preference and the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section within thirty calendar days of making a final determination that the information submitted is not eligible for protections under the CII Act. If the submitting person or entity cannot be notified or the submitting person or entity's response is not received within thirty calendar days of the date of the notification as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the PCII Program Office will make the initial determination final and return the information to the submitter. If return to the submitter is impractical, the PCII Program Office will destroy the information within thirty calendar days. This process is consistent with the appropriate National Archives and Records Administration-approved records disposition schedule.
