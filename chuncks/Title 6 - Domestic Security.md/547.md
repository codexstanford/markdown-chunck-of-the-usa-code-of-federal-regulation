### PART 19 - NONDISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS
#### ยง 19.9 Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements.

(a) A faith-based organization's exemption, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1), from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion is not forfeited when the organization seeks or receives financial assistance from DHS for a social service program or otherwise participates in a DHS program.

(b) Where a DHS program contains independent statutory or regulatory provisions that impose nondiscrimination requirements on all grantees, those provisions are not waived or mitigated by this part. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate DHS program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements.
