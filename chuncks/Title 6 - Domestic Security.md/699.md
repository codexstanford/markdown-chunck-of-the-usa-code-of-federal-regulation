##### § 27.200 Information regarding security risk for a chemical facility.
###### Presumptively High-Risk Facilities.

(c)(1) If a chemical facility subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section fails to provide information requested or complete the Top-Screen within the time frame provided in § 27.210, the Executive Assistant Director may, after attempting to consult with the facility, reach a preliminary determination, based on the information then available, that the facility presumptively presents a high level of security risk. The Executive Assistant Director shall then issue a notice to the entity of this determination and, if necessary, order the facility to provide information or complete the Top-Screen pursuant to these rules. If the facility then fails to do so, it may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to § 27.300, audit and inspection under § 27.250, or, if appropriate, an order to cease operations under § 27.300.

(2) If the facility deemed "presumptively high risk" pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section completes the Top-Screen, and the Department determines that it does not present a high level of security risk under § 27.205, its status as "presumptively high risk" will terminate, and the Department will issue a notice to the facility to that effect.
