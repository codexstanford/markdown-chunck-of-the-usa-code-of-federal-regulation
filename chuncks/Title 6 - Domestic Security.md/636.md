##### Content of Designation.

(e)(1) A Designation shall:

(i) Describe the Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (in such detail as the Under Secretary deems to be appropriate);

(ii) Identify the Seller(s) of the Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology;

(iii) Specify the earliest date of sale of the Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology to which the Designation shall apply (which shall be determined by the Under Secretary in his discretion, and may be prior to, but shall not be later than, the effective date of the Designation);

(iv) Set forth the insurance certification required by ยง 25.5(g); and

(v) To the extent practicable, include such standards, specifications, requirements, performance criteria, limitations, or other information as the Department in its sole and unreviewable discretion may deem appropriate.

(2) The Designation may, but need not, specify other entities that are required to be covered by the liability insurance required to be purchased by the Seller. The failure to specify a covered person, firm, or other entity in a Designation will not preclude the application or applicability of the Act's protections to that person, firm, or other entity.
