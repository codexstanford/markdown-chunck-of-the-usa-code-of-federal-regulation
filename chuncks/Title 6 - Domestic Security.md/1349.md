####### General.

(a)The Department may provide a DHS-CS employee a LCTMS to ensure the employee receives a sufficiently competitive salary, as described in ยง 158.610(a). A LCTMS accounts for the difference between a salary as determined under a salary structure, described in ยง 158.611, and the Department's determination as to what constitutes a sufficiently competitive salary for that local cybersecurity talent market. The Department determines whether a LCTMS is necessary, and establishes and periodically adjusts local cybersecurity talent markets and local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentages, based on the strategy, information, principles and practices, and priorities listed in ยง 158.602(a).
