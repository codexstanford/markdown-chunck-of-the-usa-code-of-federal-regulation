###### ยง 158.604 Aggregate compensation limit.
####### Limiting aggregate compensation.

(a)A DHS-CS employee may not receive additional compensation listed in in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section if such receipt would cause a DHS-CS employee's aggregate compensation for a calendar year to exceed the aggregate compensation limit applicable to that employee. A DHS-CS employee's applicable aggregate compensation limit is the limit amount assigned to the subrange of a salary structure, described in ยง 158.611, that contains the employee's salary. The Department assigns an aggregate compensation limit to each subrange in a salary structure by assigning the amounts referenced in 5 U.S.C. 5307(d)(1) in ascending order to the subranges, such that each subrange has an aggregate compensation limit that is greater than or equal to the salary maximum of that subrange.
