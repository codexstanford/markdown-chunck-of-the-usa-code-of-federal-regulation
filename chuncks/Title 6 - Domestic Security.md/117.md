###### Agreement to pay fees.

(d)DHS and components shall charge for processing requests under the Privacy Act or JRA. DHS and components will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method for processing requested records. DHS may contact a requester for additional information in order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section. DHS ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. If one makes a Privacy Act or JRA request for access to records, it will be considered a firm commitment to pay all applicable fees charged under ยง 5.29, up to $25.00. The component responsible for responding to a request ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgement letter. When making a request, an individual may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
