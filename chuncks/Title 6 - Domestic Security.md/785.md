(3) Refer requests for CVI by persons without a need to know to the Executive Assistant Director;

(4) Mark CVI as specified in § 27.400(f);

(5) Dispose of CVI as specified in § 27.400(k);

(6) If a covered person receives a record or verbal transmission containing CVI that is not marked as specified in § 27.400(f), the covered person must:

(i) Mark the record as specified in § 27.400(f) of this section; and

(ii) Inform the sender of the record that the record must be marked as specified in § 27.400(f); or

(iii) If received verbally, make reasonable efforts to memorialize such information and mark the memorialized record as specified in § 27.400(f) of this section, and inform the speaker of any determination that such information warrants CVI protection.

(7) When a covered person becomes aware that CVI has been released to persons without a need to know (including a covered person under § 27.400(c)(2)), the covered person must promptly inform the Executive Assistant Director; and

(8) In the case of information that is CVI and also has been designated as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information under 6 U.S.C. 133, any covered person in possession of such information must comply with the disclosure restrictions and other requirements applicable to such information under 6 U.S.C. 133 and any implementing regulations.
