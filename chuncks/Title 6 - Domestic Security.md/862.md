##### Changing the status of PCII to non-PCII.

(g)Once information is validated, only the PCII Program Manager may change the status of PCII to that of non-PCII and remove its PCII markings. Status changes may only take place when the submitting person or entity requests in writing that the information no longer be protected under the CII Act; or when the PCII Program Office determines that the information was, at the time of the submission, customarily in the public domain. Upon making an initial determination that a change in status may be warranted, but prior to a final determination, the PCII Program Office, using the procedures in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will inform the submitting person or entity of the initial determination of a change in status. Notice of the final change in status of PCII will be provided to all recipients of PCII received under ยง 29.8.
