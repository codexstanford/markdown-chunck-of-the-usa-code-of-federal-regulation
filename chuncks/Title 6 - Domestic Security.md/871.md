(b)The PCII Program Office or a PCII Program Manager's Designee may provide PCII to an employee of the federal government, provided, subject to paragraph (f) of this section, that such information is shared for purposes of securing the critical infrastructure or protected systems, analysis, warning, interdependency study, recovery, reconstitution, or for another appropriate purpose including, without limitation, the identification, analysis, prevention, preemption, and/or disruption of terrorist threats to the homeland. PCII may not be used, directly or indirectly, for any collateral regulatory purpose. PCII may be provided to a State or Local government entity for the purpose of protecting critical infrastructure or protected systems, or in furtherance of the investigation or prosecution of a criminal act. The provision of PCII to a State or Local government entity will normally be made only pursuant to an arrangement with the PCII Program Manager providing for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and acknowledging the understanding and responsibilities of the recipient. State and Local governments receiving such information will acknowledge in such arrangements the primacy of PCII protections under the CII Act; agree to assert all available legal defenses to disclosure of PCII under State or Local public disclosure laws, statutes, or ordinances; and will agree to treat breaches of the agreements by their employees or contractors as matters subject to the applicable criminal code or employee code of conduct for the jurisdiction.
