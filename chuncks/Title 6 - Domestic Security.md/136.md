(c)Consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, the decision on an appeal will be made in writing generally twenty (20) working days after receipt. However, consistent with the procedures in subpart A to this part, the time limit for responding to an appeal may be extended provided the circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i) are met. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform the requester of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision. An adverse determination by the DHS Office of the General Counsel or its designee or Component Appeals Officer will be the final action of the Department.
