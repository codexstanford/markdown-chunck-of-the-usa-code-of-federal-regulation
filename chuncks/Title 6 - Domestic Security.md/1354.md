####### Eligibility and termination.

(d)(1) The Department determines eligibility for a LCTMS under this section and CTMS policy implementing this section. A DHS-CS employee is eligible for a LCTMS if the employee's official worksite, as determined under ยง 158.704, is located in a local cybersecurity talent market with an assigned local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentage for the salary structure under which the employee's salary is provided.

(2) The Department terminates a LCTMS a DHS-CS employee receives when the employee's official worksite, as determined under ยง 158.704, is no longer in a local cybersecurity talent market with an assigned local cybersecurity talent market supplement percentage, or the salary structure under which the employee's salary is provided no longer has an assigned local cybersecurity labor market supplement, or both.

(3) A reduction in salary for a DHS-CS employee because of a change in any LCTMS for that employee is not a reduction in pay for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 7512 and 5 CFR part 752.
