### PART 126 - TRANSPORTATION SECURITY OVERSIGHT BOARD REVIEW PANEL PROCESS AND PROCEDURES
#### ยง 126.27 Deliberations and action.
##### Written explanation.

(c)A TSOB Review Panel will explain its action in writing to the maximum extent permitted by prudent concern for the national security interests of the United States and applicable laws and regulations governing information disclosure. If necessary, the Review Panel may prepare its written explanation in both a protected format (which may contain classified information, SSI, and other protected information) and a non-protected format (which must not contain classified information, SSI, and other protected information). The Review Panel serves non-government parties with the non-protected written explanation and government parties with the protected written explanation. The Review Panel is prohibited from providing the protected written explanation to non-government parties. The protected written explanation is part of the final administrative record that TSA must submit to a U.S. Court of Appeals in the event that a party seeks judicial review of the Review Panel's action.
