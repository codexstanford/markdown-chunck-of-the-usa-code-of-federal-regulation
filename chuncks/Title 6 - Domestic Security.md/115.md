###### Government-wide SORNs.

(b)A government-wide system of records is a system of records where one agency has regulatory authority over records in the custody of multiple agencies, and the agency with regulatory authority publishes a SORN that applies to all of the records regardless of their custodial location. If records are sought that are covered by a Government-wide SORN and requested of DHS, DHS will consult or refer such request, only as applicable and necessary, to the corresponding agency having authority over such records for further processing. DHS will acknowledge to the requester that it is referring the request to another agency or consulting with that agency when processing the request.
