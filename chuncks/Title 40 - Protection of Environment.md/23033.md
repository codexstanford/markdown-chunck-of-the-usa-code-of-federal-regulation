####### Exhaust gas

(x)means any offgas (the constituents of which may consist of any fluids, either as a liquid and/or gas) discharged directly or ultimately to the atmosphere that was initially contained in or was in direct contact with the equipment for which gas limits are prescribed in §§ 61.62(a) and (b); 61.63(a); 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d); 61.65 (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), (b)(7), and (b)(9)(ii); and 61.65(d). A leak as defined in paragraph (w) of this section is not an exhaust gas. Equipment which contains exhaust gas is subject to § 61.65(b)(8), whether or not that equipment contains 10 percent by volume vinyl chloride.
