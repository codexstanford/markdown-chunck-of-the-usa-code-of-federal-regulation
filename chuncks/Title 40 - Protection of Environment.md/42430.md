####### Contents.

(3)Each thermal energy plan shall contain the following elements in a format prescribed by the Administrator:

(i) The calendar year and quarter that the thermal energy plan takes effect, which shall be the first year and quarter the replacement unit(s) will replace thermal energy of the opt-in source;

(ii) The name, authorized account representative identification number, and telephone number of the designated representative of the opt-in source;

(iii) The name, authorized account representative identification number, and telephone number of the designated representative of each replacement unit;

(iv) The account identification number in the Allowance Tracking System of the source that includes the opt-in source;

(v) The account identification number in the Allowance Tracking System of each source that includes a replacement unit;

(vi) The type of fuel used by each replacement unit;

(vii) The allowable SOemissions rate, expressed in lbs/mmBtu, of each replacement unit for the calendar year for which the plan will take effect. When a thermal energy plan is renewed in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section, the allowable SOemission rate at each replacement unit will be the most stringent federally enforceable allowable SOemissions rate applicable at the time of renewal for the calendar year for which the renewal will take effect. This rate will not be annualized;

(viii) The estimated annual amount of total thermal energy to be reduced at the opt-in source, including all energy flows (steam, gas, or hot water) used for any process or in any heating or cooling application, and, for a plan starting April 1, July 1, or October 1, such estimated amount of total thermal energy to be reduced starting April 1, July 1, or October 1 respectively and ending on December 31;

(ix) The estimated amount of total thermal energy at each replacement unit for the calendar year prior to the year for which the plan is to take effect, including all energy flows (steam, gas, or hot water) used for any process or in any heating or cooling application, and, for a plan starting April 1, July 1, or October 1, such estimated amount of total thermal energy for the portion of such calendar year starting April 1, July 1, or October 1 respectively;

(x) The estimated annual amount of total thermal energy at each replacement unit after replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source, including all energy flows (steam, gas, or hot water) used for any process or in any heating or cooling application, and, for a plan starting April 1, July 1, or October 1, such estimated amount of total thermal energy at each replacement unit after replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source starting April 1, July 1, or October 1 respectively and ending December 31;

(xi) The estimated annual amount of thermal energy at each replacement unit, including all energy flows (steam, gas, or hot water) used for any process or in any heating or cooling application, replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source, and, for a plan starting April 1, July 1, or October 1, such estimated amount of thermal energy replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source starting April 1, July 1, or October 1 respectively and ending December 31;

(xii) The estimated annual total fuel input at each replacement unit after replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source and, for a plan starting April 1, July 1, or October 1, such estimated total fuel input after replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source starting April 1, July 1, or October 1 respectively and ending December 31;

(xiii) The number of allowances calculated under paragraph (b) of this section that the opt-in source will transfer to each replacement unit represented in the thermal energy plan.

(xiv) The estimated number of allowances to be deducted for reduced utilization under ยง 74.44;

(xv) Certification that each replacement unit has entered into a legally binding steam sales agreement to provide the thermal energy, as calculated under paragraph (a)(3)(xi) of this section, that it is replacing for the opt-in source. The designated representative of each replacement unit shall maintain and make available to the Administrator, at the Administrator's request, copies of documents demonstrating that the replacement unit is replacing the thermal energy at the opt-in source.
