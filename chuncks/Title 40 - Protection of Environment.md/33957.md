######## Specialty desolventizer

means a desolventizer that removes excess solvent from soybean meal using vacuum conditions, energy from superheated solvent vapors, or reduced operating conditions (e.g., temperature) as compared to the typical operation of a conventional desolventizer. Soybeans processed in a specialty desolventizer result in high-protein vegetable meal products for human and animal consumption, such as calf milk replacement products and meat extender products.
