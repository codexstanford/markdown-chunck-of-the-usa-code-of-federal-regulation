######## Procedure.
######### Procedure.
########## H,quench verification procedure.

(e)OUse the following method to determine HO quench, or use good engineering judgment to develop a different protocol:

(1) Use PTFE or stainless steel tubing to make necessary connections.

(2) If the CLD analyzer has an operating mode in which it detects NO-only, as opposed to total NO, operate the CLD analyzer in the NO-only operating mode.

(3) Use an NO span gas that meets the specifications of ยง 1065.750 and a concentration that is near the maximum concentration expected during emission testing.
