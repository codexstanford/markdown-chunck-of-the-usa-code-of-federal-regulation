##### Subpart C - Procedures for Calculating Fuel Economy and Carbon-Related Exhaust Emission Values
############# ยง 600.208-12 Calculation of FTP-based and HFET-based fuel economy, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for a model type.

(a) Fuel economy, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for a base level are calculated from vehicle configuration fuel economy, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions as determined in ยง 600.206-12(a), (b), or (c) as applicable, for low-altitude tests.

(1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California and in section 177 states are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from those intended for sale in other states, she will calculate fuel economy, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each base level for vehicles intended for sale in California and in section 177 states and for each base level for vehicles intended for sale in the rest of the states.

(2) In order to highlight the fuel efficiency, COemissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions of certain designs otherwise included within a model type, a manufacturer may wish to subdivide a model type into one or more additional model types. This is accomplished by separating subconfigurations from an existing base level and placing them into a new base level. The new base level is identical to the existing base level except that it shall be considered, for the purposes of this paragraph, as containing a new basic engine. The manufacturer will be permitted to designate such new basic engines and base level(s) if:

(i) Each additional model type resulting from division of another model type has a unique car line name and that name appears on the label and on the vehicle bearing that label;
