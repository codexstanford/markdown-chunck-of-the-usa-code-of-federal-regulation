## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter N - Effluent Guidelines and Standards
#### PART 423 - STEAM ELECTRIC POWER GENERATING POINT SOURCE CATEGORY
##### ยง 423.13 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
###### Combustion residual leachate.

(l)The quantity of pollutants discharged in combustion residual leachate shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of combustion residual leachate times the concentration for TSS listed in ยง 423.12(b)(11).

(m) At the permitting authority's discretion, the quantity of pollutant allowed to be discharged may be expressed as a concentration limitation instead of any mass based limitations specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section. Concentration limitations shall be those concentrations specified in this section.

(n) In the event that wastestreams from various sources are combined for treatment or discharge, the quantity of each pollutant or pollutant property controlled in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section attributable to each controlled waste source shall not exceed the specified limitation for that waste source.

(o)(1) Transfer between applicable limitations in a permit. Where, in the permit, the permitting authority has included alternative limits subject to eligibility requirements, upon timely notification to the permitting authority under ยง 423.19(i), a facility can become subject to the alternative limits under the following circumstances:

(i) On or before December 31, 2023 a facility may convert:

(A) From limitations for electric generating units permanently ceasing coal combustion under paragraphs (g)(2)(i) or (k)(2)(ii) of this section to limitations for low utilization electric generating units under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) or (k)(2)(iii) of this section; or

(B) From voluntary incentives program limitations under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section or generally applicable limitations under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section to limitations for low utilization electric generating units under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) or (k)(2)(iii) of this section.

(ii) On or before December 31, 2025 a facility may convert

(A) From voluntary incentives program limitations under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section to limitations for electric generating units permanently ceasing coal combustion under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section; or

(B) From limitations for electric generating units permanently ceasing coal combustion under paragraphs (g)(2)(i) or (k)(2)(ii) of this section to voluntary incentives program limitations under paragraphs (g)(3)(i) of this section or generally applicable limitations under (k)(1)(i) of this section; or

(C) From limitations for low utilization electric generating units under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) or (k)(2)(iii) of this section to generally applicable limitations under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (k)(1)(i) of this section; or

(D) From limitations for low utilization electric generating units under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) or (k)(2)(iii) of this section to voluntary incentives program limitations under paragraphs (g)(3)(i) of this section or generally applicable limitations under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section; or

(E) From limitations for low utilization electric generating units under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) or (k)(2)(iii) of this section to limitations for electric generating units permanently ceasing coal combustion under paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) of this section.

(2) A facility must be in compliance with all of its currently applicable requirements to be eligible to file a notice under ยง 423.19(i) and to become subject to a different set of applicable requirements under paragraph (o)(1) of this section.

(3) Where a facility seeking a transfer under paragraph (o)(1)(ii) of this section is currently subject to more stringent limitations than the limitations being sought, the facility must continue to meet those more stringent limitations.
