####### Measured and declared test speeds and torques.

(f)You must select test speeds and torques for cycle generation as required in this paragraph (f). "Measured" values are either directly measured during the engine mapping process or they are determined from the engine map. "Declared" values are specified by the manufacturer. When both measured and declared values are available, you may use declared test speeds and torques instead of measured speeds and torques if they meet the criteria in this paragraph (f). Otherwise, you must use measured speeds and torques derived from the engine map.
