####### Findings.

(ii)Prior to approving a transportation plan/program, the MPO shall determine if the plan/program conforms to the applicable implementation plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make and support each of the following findings for each transportation plan and program using the information documented in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:

(A) that implementation of the transportation plan/program will provide for the implementation of TCMs in the applicable plan on the schedule set forth in the applicable plan;

(B) that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from the implementation of the plan/program will not delay attainment or achievement of any interim emission reductions needed for attainment and/or interfere with maintenance of the CONAAQS throughout the nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan; and

(C) that implementation of the plan/program would not cause or contribute to a violation of the CO NAAQS anywhere within the nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan.
