####### General.,N,N,N

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (a mixture of a minimum of 90% 4&#x2032;-epi-methylamino-4&#x2032;-deoxyavermectin Band maximum of 10% 4&#x2032;-epi-methylamino-4&#x2032;-deoxyavermectin B) and its metabolites 8,9-isomer of the Band Bcomponent of the parent (8,9-ZMA), or 4&#x2032;-deoxy-4&#x2032;-epi-amino-avermectin Band 4'-deoxy-4&#x2032;-epi-amino-avermectin B; 4&#x2032;-deoxy-4&#x2032;-epi-amino avermectin B(AB); 4&#x2032;-deoxy-4&#x2032;-epi-(-formyl--methyl)amino-avermectin (MFB); and 4&#x2032;-deoxy-4&#x2032;-epi-(-formyl)amino-avermectin B(FAB), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of emamectin.

(2) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (MAB+ MABisomers) and the associated 8,9-Z isomers (8,9-ZBand 8,9-ZB).
