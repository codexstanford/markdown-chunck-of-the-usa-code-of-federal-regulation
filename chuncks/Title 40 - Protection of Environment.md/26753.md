####### 3

() Procedures for calculating the percent reduction of pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(3) Emissions from storage vessels shall be calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.150(g)(3).

(4) Emissions from back-end process operations shall be calculated as follows:

(i) Equation 36 shall be used to calculate EBEP:

(ii) Equation 37 shall be used to calculate EBEP:

(5) Emissions from wastewater shall be calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.150(g)(5).

(6) Emissions from batch front-end process vents shall be calculated as follows:

(i) EBFEPVfor each batch front-end process vent i shall be calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.488(b).

(ii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to determine EBFEPV:

(A) If the batch front-end process vent is not controlled by a control device or pollution prevention measure, EBFEPV= EBFEPV, where EBFEPVis calculated according to the procedures in § 63.488(b).

(B) If the batch front-end process vent is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 90 percent reduction for the batch cycle, calculate EBFEPVusing Equation 38, where percent reduction is for the batch cycle.
