####### How do I handle incompatible remediation wastes in a staging pile?

(f)The term "incompatible waste" is defined in ยง 260.10 of this chapter. You must comply with the following requirements for incompatible wastes in staging piles:

(1) You must not place incompatible remediation wastes in the same staging pile unless you have complied with ยง 264.17(b);

(2) If remediation waste in a staging pile is incompatible with any waste or material stored nearby in containers, other piles, open tanks or land disposal units (for example, surface impoundments), you must separate the incompatible materials, or protect them from one another by using a dike, berm, wall or other device; and

(3) You must not pile remediation waste on the same base where incompatible wastes or materials were previously piled, unless the base has been decontaminated sufficiently to comply with ยง 264.17(b).
