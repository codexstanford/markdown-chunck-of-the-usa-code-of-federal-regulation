###### Operator Requirements.

2.4The FTIR analyst shall be trained in setting up the instrumentation, verifying the instrument is functioning properly, and performing routine maintenance. The analyst must evaluate the initial sample spectra to determine if the sample matrix is consistent with pre-test assumptions and if the instrument configuration is suitable. The analyst must be able to modify the instrument configuration, if necessary.

2.4.1 The spectral analysis shall be supervised by someone familiar with EPA FTIR Protocol procedures.

2.4.2 A technician trained in instrumental test methods is qualified to install and operate the sampling system. This includes installing the probe and heated line assembly, operating the analyte spike system, and performing moisture and flow measurements.

See appendix A of the Protocol for definitions relating to infrared spectroscopy. Additional definitions are given in sections 3.1 through 3.29.
