###### § 79.54 Tier 3.
####### General Criteria for Requiring Tier 3 Testing.

(a)(1) Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from a fuel or fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by emissions from the fuel or additive products. Tier 3 testing may be conducted either on an individual basis or a group basis. If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests.

(2) In addition to the criteria specific to particular tests as summarized and detailed in the testing guidelines (§§ 79.62 through 79.68), EPA may consider a number of factors (including, but not limited to):

(i) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint;

(ii) The identification of concentration-effect relationships;

(iii) The statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies;

(iv) The severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects would be likely to lead to incapacitating or irreversible conditions);

(v) The type and number of species included in the reported tests;

(vi) The consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes;

(vii) The presence or absence of effective health test control data for base-fuel-only versus additive/base fuel mixture comparisons;

(viii) The nature and amount of known toxic agents in the emissions stream; and

(ix) The observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important exposure route.
