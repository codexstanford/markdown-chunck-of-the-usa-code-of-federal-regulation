###### Identify Potential Interferants.

4.2Considering the chemistry of the process or results of previous studies, identify potential interferants, i.e., the major effluent constituents and any relatively minor effluent constituents that possess either strong absorption characteristics or strong structural similarities to any analyte of interest. Label them 1 through N, where the subscript "j" pertains to potential interferants. Estimate the concentrations of these compounds in the effluent (CPOT, ppm).
