(2) If EPA's written notice does not state that modification or withdrawal is necessary based upon public comments, then the proposed decision shall become final thirty days after the date of issuance of EPA's written notice. If EPA's written notice states that modification or withdrawal is necessary, the parties shall have thirty days from the date of issuance of EPA's written notice to modify the proposed decision so that it is no longer inappropriate, improper or inadequate and to set forth the proposed decision, as modified, in an agreed settlement.

If the parties do not modify the proposed decision in an agreed settlement within thirty days, the proposed decision shall be null and void and of no legal effect, EPA shall withdraw from the proceeding, and the Arbitrator shall assess such administrative fees and expenses (ยง 304.41 of this part) against the parties as the Arbitrator deems appropriate.

(f) Payment of EPA's award, if any, and any fees or expenses due pursuant to the final decision, shall be made within thirty days after the date of the final decision.
