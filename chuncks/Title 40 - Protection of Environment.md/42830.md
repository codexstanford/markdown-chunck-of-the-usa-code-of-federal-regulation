############### ยง 75.72 Determination of NOmass emissions for common stack and multiple stack configurations.

The owner or operator of an affected unit shall either: calculate hourly NOmass emissions (in lbs) by multiplying the hourly NOemission rate (in lbs/mmBtu) by the hourly heat input rate (in mmBtu/hr) and the unit or stack operating time (as defined in ยง 72.2), or, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, calculate hourly NOmass emissions from the hourly NOconcentration (in ppm) and the hourly stack flow rate (in scfh). Only one methodology for determining NOmass emissions shall be identified in the monitoring plan for each monitoring location at any given time. The owner or operator shall also calculate quarterly and cumulative year-to-date NOmass emissions and cumulative NOmass emissions for the ozone season (in tons) by summing the hourly NOmass emissions according to the procedures in section 8 of appendix F to this part.
