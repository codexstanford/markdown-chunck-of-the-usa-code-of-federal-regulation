###### ยง 798.5275 Sex-linked recessive lethal test in drosophila melanogaster.
####### Description.

(2)Wild-type males are treated and mated to appropriate females. Female offspring are mated individually to their brothers, and in the next generation the progeny from each separate dose are scored for phenotypically wild-type males. Absence of these males indicates that a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation has occurred in a germ cell of the Pmale.
