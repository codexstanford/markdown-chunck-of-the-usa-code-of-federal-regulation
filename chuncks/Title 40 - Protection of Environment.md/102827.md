####### ยง 1065.365 Nonmethane cutter penetration fractions.
######## Scope and frequency.,PF,PF

(a)If you use a FID analyzer and a nonmethane cutter (NMC) to measure methane (CH), determine the nonmethane cutter's penetration fractions of methane,, and ethane,. As detailed in this section, these penetration fractions may be determined as a combination of NMC penetration fractions and FID analyzer response factors, depending on your particular NMC and FID analyzer configuration. Perform this verification after installing the nonmethane cutter. Repeat this verification within 185 days of testing to verify that the catalytic activity of the cutter has not deteriorated. Note that because nonmethane cutters can deteriorate rapidly and without warning if they are operated outside of certain ranges of gas concentrations and outside of certain temperature ranges, good engineering judgment may dictate that you determine a nonmethane cutter's penetration fractions more frequently.
