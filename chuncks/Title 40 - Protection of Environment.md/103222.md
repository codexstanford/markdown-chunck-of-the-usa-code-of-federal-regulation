(2) Enter the equations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section into a computer program to iteratively solve for,, and. Use good engineering judgment to guess initial values for,, and. We recommend guessing an initial amount of water that is about twice the amount of water in your intake or dilution air. We recommend guessing an initial value ofas the sum of your measured CO, CO, and THC values. We also recommend guessing an initialbetween 0.75 and 0.95, such as 0.8. Iterate values in the system of equations until the most recently updated guesses are all within +/-1% of their respective most recently calculated values.

(3) Use the following symbols and subscripts in the equations for performing the chemical balance calculations in this paragraph (c):
