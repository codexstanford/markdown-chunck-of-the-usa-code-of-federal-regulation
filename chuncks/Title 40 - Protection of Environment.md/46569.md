####### Durability data.

(ii)Small-volume manufacturers may satisfy the durability data requirements with the following procedures:

(A) Manufacturers with aggregated sales of less than 301 motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year may use assigned deterioration factors that the Administrator determines and prescribes. The factors will be the Administrator's estimate, periodically updated and published in an advisory letter or advisory circular, of the 70th percentile deterioration factors calculated using the industry-wide data base of previously completed durability data vehicles or engines used for certification. However, the manufacturer may, at its option, accumulate miles (hours) on a durability data vehicle (engine) and complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing its own deterioration factors.
