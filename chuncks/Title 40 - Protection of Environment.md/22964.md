##### Subpart C - National Emission Standard for Beryllium
###### § 61.32 Emission standard.

(a) Emissions to the atmosphere from stationary sources subject to the provisions of this subpart shall not exceed 10 grams (0.022 lb) of beryllium over a 24-hour period, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Rather than meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator to meet an ambient concentration limit on beryllium in the vicinity of the stationary source of 0.01 µg/m(4.37 x 10gr/ft), averaged over a 30-day period.

(1) Approval of such requests may be granted by the Administrator provided that:

(i) At least 3 years of data is available which in the judgment of the Administrator demonstrates that the future ambient concentrations of beryllium in the vicinity of the stationary source will not exceed 0.01 µg/m(4.37 x 10gr/ft), averaged over a 30-day period. Such 3-year period shall be the 3 years ending 30 days before the effective date of this standard.

(ii) The owner or operator requests such approval in writing within 30 days after the effective date of this standard.

(iii) The owner or operator submits a report to the Administrator within 45 days after the effective date of this standard which report includes the following information:
