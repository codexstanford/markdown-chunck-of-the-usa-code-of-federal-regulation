###### 8.2 Recording Observations.

You must record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 5-second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each observation recorded represents the average of emissions for the 5-second period. The overall time for which recordings are made must be of a length appropriate to the applicable regulation for which opacity is being measured.

The calibration and standardization procedures are the same as Section 10 of Method 203A.
