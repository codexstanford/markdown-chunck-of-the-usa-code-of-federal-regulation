###### § 63.705 Performance test methods and procedures to determine initial compliance.
####### Initial compliance demonstrations.

(c)Except as stipulated in § 63.705(a), each owner or operator subject to the requirements of § 63.703(c) must demonstrate initial compliance with the requirements of this subpart by following the procedures of paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) and paragraph (d) of this section, as applicable. Each owner or operator subject to § 63.703(d), (e), (f), and (g) must demonstrate initial compliance with the requirements of this subpart by following the procedures of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this section, as appropriate.

(1) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4) when emissions from only the affected coating operations are controlled by a dedicated solvent recovery device, each owner or operator of the affected coating operation may perform a liquid-liquid HAP or VOC material balance over rolling 7-day periods in lieu of demonstrating compliance through the methods in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) of this section. Results of the material balances calculation performed to demonstrate initial compliance shall be submitted to the Administrator with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.9(h) and § 63.707(d). When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 63.7(e)(3) of subpart A does not apply. The amount of liquid HAP or VOC applied and recovered shall be determined as discussed in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. The overall HAP or VOC emission reduction (R) is calculated using equation 1:

(i) The value of RSis zero unless the owner or operator submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a measured RSvalue that is greater than zero:

(A) Measurement techniques; and

(B) Documentation that the measured value of RSexceeds zero.

(ii) The measurement techniques of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval with the notification of performance test required under § 63.7(b).

(iii) Each owner or operator demonstrating compliance by the test method described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall:

(A) Measure the amount of coating applied at the coater;

(B) Determine the VOC or HAP content of all coating applied using the test method specified in § 63.705(b) (1) or (2);

(C) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the amount of HAP or VOC recovered by the solvent recovery device over rolling 7-day periods; the device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within +/-2.0 percent, and this certification shall be kept on record;

(D) Measure the amount of HAP or VOC recovered; and

(E) Calculate the overall HAP or VOC emission reduction (R) for rolling 7-day periods using Equation 1.

(iv) Compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.703 (c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4).

(2) To demonstrate initial compliance with § 63.703 (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by an emission control device other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures.

(i) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total HAP or VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 63.705(b) (3) through (8).

(ii) Determine capture efficiency from the HAP emission points by capturing, venting, and measuring all HAP emissions from the HAP emission points. During a performance test, the owner or operator of affected HAP emission points located in an area with other gaseous emission sources not affected by this subpart shall isolate the affected HAP emission points from all other gaseous emission points by one of the following methods:

(A) Build a temporary total enclosure (see § 63.702) around the affected HAP emission point(s); or

(B) Shut down all gaseous emission points not affected by this subpart and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected HAP emission points through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as drying ovens.

All ventilation air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing.

(iii) Operate the emission control device with all affected HAP emission points connected and operating.

(iv) Determine the efficiency (E) of the control device using equation 2:

(v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the capture system using equation 3:

(vi) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.703, compliance is demonstrated if either of the following conditions are met:

(A) The product of (E) x (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4); or

(B) When the owner or operator is subject to § 63.703(c)(2), the value of F is equal to 1 and the value of Cat the outlet of the incinerator is demonstrated to be no greater than 20 ppmv by compound, on a dry basis.

(3) To demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:

(i) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that each volumetric flow rate and the total HAP emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 63.705(b) (3) through (8);

(ii) Assure that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are segregated from gaseous emission points not affected by this subpart and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in § 63.705(c)(2)(ii) (A) and (B);

(iii) Operate the emission control device with all affected HAP emission points connected and operating;

(iv) Determine the efficiency (H) of each individual carbon adsorber vessel (v) using equation 4:

(v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system (H) by computing the average efficiency of the individual carbon adsorber vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Q) of each individual carbon adsorber vessel (v) using equation 5:

(vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the capture system using equation (3).

(vii) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.703(c), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (H) x (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(3), or (c)(4).

(4) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with § 63.703(c)(1) through (c)(4) is the installation of a total enclosure around the affected HAP emission point(s) and the ventilation of all HAP emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the efficiency or outlet concentration specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected source shall:

(i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure that meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section shall be considered a total enclosure. The owner or operator of an enclosure that does not meet these requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:

(A) Total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;

(B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;

(C) Average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:
