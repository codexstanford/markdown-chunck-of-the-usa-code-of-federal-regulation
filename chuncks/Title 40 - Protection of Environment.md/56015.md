###### ยง 141.82 Description of corrosion control treatment requirements.
####### Step 1: corrosion control treatment assessment.,systems without corrosion control treatment

(1)The water system must sample at a new water quality parameter site that is on the same size water main in the same pressure zone and located within a half mile of the location with the action level exceedance within 5 days of receiving the sample results. Small watermay have up to 14 days to collect the samples. The water system must measure the following parameters:

(i) pH;

(ii) Alkalinity;

(iii) Orthophosphate (as PO), when an inhibitor containing an orthophosphate compound is used;

(iv) Silica, when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used; and

(v) Water systems with an existing water quality parameter location that meets the requirements of this section can conduct this sampling at that location.

(vi) All water systems required to meet optimal water quality control parameters but that do not have an existing water quality parameter location that meets the requirement of this section must add new sites to the minimum number of sites as described in ยง 141.87(g). Sites must be added until a system has twice the minimum number of sites listed in Table 1 to ยง 141.87(a)(2). When a system exceeds this upper threshold for the number of sites, the State has discretion to determine if the newer site can better assess the effectiveness of the corrosion control treatment and to remove existing sites during sanitary survey evaluation of OCCT.
