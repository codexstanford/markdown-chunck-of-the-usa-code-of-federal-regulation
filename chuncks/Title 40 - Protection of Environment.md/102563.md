###### ยง 1065.125 Engine intake air.
####### Humidity.

(2)You may use a single shared humidity measurement for intake air as long as your equipment for handling intake air maintains dewpoint at all intakes to within +/-0.5 &#xB0;C of the shared humidity measurement. For engines with multiple intakes with separate humidity measurements at each intake, use a flow-weighted average humidity for NOcorrections. If individual flows of each intake are not measured, use good engineering judgment to estimate a flow-weighted average humidity.
