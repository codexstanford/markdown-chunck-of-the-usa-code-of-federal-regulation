####### Baseline factors.

(2)The baseline HAP and VOC factors shall be calculated by dividing the consumption of total HAP and total VOC by the production rate, per process, for the first 3-year period in which the process was operational, beginning no earlier than the period consisting of the 1987 through 1989 calendar years. Alternatively, for a process that has been operational for less than 3 years, but more than 1 year, the baseline factors shall be established for the time period from startup of the process until the present.
