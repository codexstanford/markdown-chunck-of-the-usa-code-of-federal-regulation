####### Procedure:

Sort all the daily values from a particular site and year by descending value. (For example: (x[1], x[2], x[3], * * *, x[n]). In this case, x[1] is the largest number and x[n] is the smallest value.) The 98th percentile value is determined from this sorted series of daily values which is ordered from the highest to the lowest number. Using the left column of Table 1, determine the appropriate range for the annual creditable number of samples for year y (cn) (e.g., for 120 creditable samples per year, the appropriate range would be 101 to 150). The corresponding "n" value in the right column identifies the rank of the annual 98th percentile value in the descending sorted list of site specific daily values for year y (e.g., for the range of 101 to 150, n would be 3). Thus, P= the nlargest value (e.g., for the range of 101 to 150, the 98th percentile value would be the third highest value in the sorted series of daily values.

(b) The 24-hour PMNAAQS DV is then calculated by averaging the annual 98th percentiles using equation 4 of this appendix: P

P= the 24-hour PMNAAQS DV; and
