(i) In the equations of 40 CFR 1036.540(c)(3)(i),is the actual top gear ratio of the powertrain instead of the transmission gear ratio in the highest available gear given in Table 1 in 40 CFR 1036.540.

(ii) Test at least eight different vehicle configurations for powertrains that will be installed in Spark-ignition HDE, vocational Light HDV, and vocational Medium HDV using the following table instead of Table 2 in 40 CFR 1036.540:

(iii) Select and test vehicle configurations as described in 40 CFR 1036.540(c)(3)(iii) for powertrains that will be installed in vocational Heavy HDV and tractors using the following tables instead of Table 3 and Table 4 in 40 CFR 1036.540:

(3) For hybrid powertrain systems where the transmission will be simulated, use the transmission parameters defined in 40 CFR 1036.540(c)(2) to determine transmission type and gear ratio. Use a fixed transmission efficiency of 0.95. The GEM HIL transmission model uses a transmission parameter file for each test that includes the transmission type, gear ratios, lockup gear, torque limit per gear from 40 CFR 1036.540(c)(2), and the values from 40 CFR 1036.505(b)(4) and (c).
