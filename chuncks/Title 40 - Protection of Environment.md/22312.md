###### 1.1 Applicability.,p

This method applies to the measurement of polychlorinated dibenzo--dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in emissions from stationary sources. Using this method, you can measure these analyte groups individually or in any combination using a single sample acquisition unless otherwise specified in a rule, regulation, or permit. Tables 23-1 through 23-3 of this method list the applicable target analytes for Method 23. If all 209 PCB are analyzed, the 17 toxic PCB congeners should be resolved and reported while the other PCB can be reported as totals by homolog, for example, total trichlorobiphenyl (TrCB).
