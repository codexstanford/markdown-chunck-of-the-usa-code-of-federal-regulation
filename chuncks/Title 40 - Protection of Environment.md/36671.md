###### Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.7325 What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the TDS or constituent limits for quench water?
######## e.g.,

(1) Take the quench water sample from a location that provides a representative sample of the quench water as applied to the coke (from the header that feeds water to the quench tower reservoirs). Conduct sampling under normal and representative operating conditions.

(2) Determine the TDS concentration of the sample using Method 160.1 in 40 CFR part 136.3 (see "residue-filterable"), except that you must dry the total filterable residue at 103 to 105 &#xB0;C (degrees Centigrade) instead of 180 &#xB0;C.

(b) If at any time you elect to meet the alternative requirements for quench water in ยง 63.7295(a)(1)(ii), you must establish a site-specific constituent limit according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
