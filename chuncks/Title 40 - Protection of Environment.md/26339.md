(b) The affected source to which the existing sourceprovisions of this subpart apply is as follows:

(1) For the processes specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the affected source is the total of all HAP emission points in the pulping and bleaching systems; or

(2) For the processes specified in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the affected source is the total of all HAP emission points in the bleaching system.

(c) The new source provisions of this subpart apply to the total of all HAP emission points at new or existing sources as follows:

(1) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that commences construction or reconstruction after December 17, 1993;

(d) Each existing source shall achieve compliance no later than April 16, 2001, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.

(1) Each kraft pulping system shall achieve compliance with the pulping system provisions of § 63.443 for the equipment listed in § 63.443(a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(v) as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 17, 2006 and the owners and operators shall establish dates, update dates, and report the dates for the milestones specified in § 63.455(b).

(2) Each dissolving-grade bleaching system at either kraft or sulfite pulping mills shall achieve compliance with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the promulgation of the revised effluent limitation guidelines and standards under 40 CFR 430.14 through 430.17 and 40 CFR 430.44 through 430.47.

(3) Each bleaching system complying with the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program for Effluent Limitation Guidelines in 40 CFR 430.24, shall comply with the requirements specified in either paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(3)(ii) of this section for the effluent limitation guidelines and standards in 40 CFR 430.24.

(i) Comply with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 16, 2001.

(ii) Comply with paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A), (d)(3)(ii)(B), and (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

(A) The owner or operator of a bleaching system shall comply with the bleach plant provisions of § 63.445 of this subpart as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than April 15, 2004.
