###### ยง 1037.510 Duty-cycle exhaust testing.

This section applies for powertrain testing, cycle-average engine fuel mapping, certain off-cycle testing under ยง 1037.610, and the advanced-technology provisions of ยง 1037.615.

(a) Measure emissions by testing the vehicle on a chassis dynamometer or the powertrain on a powertrain dynamometer with the applicable duty cycles. Each duty cycle consists of a series of speed commands over time-variable speeds for the transient test and constant speeds for the highway cruise tests. None of these cycles include vehicle starting or warmup.

(1) Perform testing for Phase 1 vehicles as follows to generate credits or adjustment factors for off-cycle or advanced technologies:
