####### Paper recycling residuals

means the secondary material generated from the recycling of paper, paperboard and corrugated containers composed primarily of wet strength and short wood fibers that cannot be used to make new paper and paperboard products. Paper recycling residuals that contain more than small amounts of non-fiber materials including polystyrene foam, polyethylene film, other plastics, waxes and adhesives, dyes and inks, clays, starches and other coating and filler material are not paper recycling residuals for purposes of this definition.
