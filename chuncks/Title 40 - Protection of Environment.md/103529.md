####### ยง 1065.1121 Vanadium sample dissolution and analysis in alumina capture beds.

This section describes the process for dissolution of vanadium from the vanadium sublimation samples collect in ยง 1065.1117 and any blanks collected in ยง 1065.1119 as well as the analysis of the digestates to determine the mass of vanadium emitted and the associated sublimation temperature threshold based on the results of all the samples taken during the reactor aging cycle.

(a) Digest the samples using the following procedure, or an equivalent procedure:

(1) Place the recovered alumina, a portion of the ground quartz tube from the reactor, and the quartz wool in a Teflon pressure vessel with a mixture made from 1.5 mL of 16 N HNO, 0.5 mL of 28 N HF, and 0.2 mL of 12 N HCl. Note that the amount of ground quartz tube from the reactor included in the digestion can influence the vanadium concentration of both the volatilized vanadium from the sample and the method detection limit. You must be consistent with the amount ground quartz tube included in the sample analysis for your testing. You must limit the amount of quartz tube to include only portions of the tube that would be likely to encounter volatilized vanadium.

(2) Program a microwave oven to heat the sample to 180 &#xB0;C over 9 minutes, followed by a 10-minute hold at that temperature, and 1 hour of ventilation/cooling.
