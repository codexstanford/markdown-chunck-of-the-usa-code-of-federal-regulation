####### Emission profile by capture and control device limitation.

(C)The emission profile shall consider the capture and control system limitations and the highest emissions, in lb/hr, that can be routed to the control device, based on maximum flowrate and concentrations possible because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, LEL alarms and safety bypasses).

(iii) Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each and a maximum of 8 hours each, are required for performance testing. Each run must occur over the same worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section.
