2.2 The measurement system is calibrated by referencing the instrumental fluorescence measurements to SOstandard concentrations traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) primary standard for SO(Calibration Procedure below).

2.3 An analyzer implementing this measurement principle is shown schematically in Figure 1. Designs should include a measurement cell, a UV light source of appropriate wavelength, a UV detector system with appropriate wave length sensitivity, a pump and flow control system for sampling the ambient air and moving it into the measurement cell, sample air conditioning components as necessary to minimize measurement interferences, suitable control and measurement processing capability, and other apparatus as may be necessary. The analyzer must be designed to provide accurate, repeatable, and continuous measurements of SOconcentrations in ambient air, with measurement performance as specified in Subpart B of Part 53 of this chapter.
