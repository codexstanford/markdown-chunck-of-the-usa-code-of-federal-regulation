####### Temperature monitor.

(4)The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a temperature monitor accurate to within +/-5.6 &#xB0;C (+/-10 &#xB0;F) or within 1 percent of the baseline temperature, whichever is less stringent, to measure the temperature. The monitor shall be installed at the exhaust point of the combustion device but not within the combustion zone. The owner or operator shall verify the accuracy of the temperature monitor once each calendar year with a reference temperature monitor (traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards or an independent temperature measurement device dedicated for this purpose). During accuracy checking, the probe of the reference device shall be at the same location as that of the temperature monitor being tested.
