######## 30-day rolling average

means the arithmetic mean of the previous 720 hours of valid CO CEMS data. The 720 hours should be consecutive, but not necessarily continuous if operations were intermittent. For parameters other than CO, 30-day rolling average means either the arithmetic mean of all valid hours of data from 30 successive operating days or the arithmetic mean of the previous 720 hours of valid operating data. Valid data excludes hours during startup and shutdown, data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, while conducting repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or while conducting required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities, and periods when this unit is not operating.
