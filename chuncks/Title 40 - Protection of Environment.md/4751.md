(c) At each monitoring location (site), Pb-TSP and Pb-PMdata are to be processed separately when selecting daily data by day (as specified in section 3(d) of this appendix), when aggregating daily data by month (per section 6(a)), and when forming 3-month means (per section 6(b)). However, when deriving (, identifying) the design value for the 38-month period, 3-month means for the two data types may be considered together; see sections 2(a) and 4(e) of this appendix for details.

(d) Daily values for sites will be selected for a site on a size cut (Pb-TSP or Pb-PM, i.e., "parameter") basis; Pb-TSP concentrations and Pb-PMconcentrations shall not be commingled in these determinations. Site level, parameter-specific daily values will be selected as follows:
