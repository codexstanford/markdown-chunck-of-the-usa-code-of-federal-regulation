##### Subpart C - Marking of PCBs and PCB Items
###### § 761.40 Marking requirements.

(a) Each of the following items in existence on or after July 1, 1978 shall be marked as illustrated in Figure 1 in § 761.45(a): The mark illustrated in Figure 1 is referred to as Mthroughout this subpart.

(1) PCB Containers;

(2) PCB Transformers at the time of manufacture, at the time of distribution in commerce if not already marked, and at the time of removal from use if not already marked. [Marking of PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment is not required];

(3) PCB Large High Voltage Capacitors at the time of manufacture, at the time of distribution in commerce if not already marked, and at the time of removal from use if not already marked;

(4) Equipment containing a PCB Transformer or a PCB Large High Voltage Capacitor at the time of manufacture, at the time of distribution in commerce if not already marked, and at the time of removal of the equipment from use if not already marked;

(5) PCB Large Low Voltage Capacitors at the time of removal from use (see also paragraph (k) of this section).

(6) Electric motors using PCB coolants (See also paragraph (e) of this section).

(7) Hydraulic systems using PCB hydraulic fluid (See also paragraph (e) of this section);

(8) Heat transfer systems (other than PCB Transformers) using PCBs (See also paragraph (e) of this section);

(9) PCB Article Containers containing articles or equipment that must be marked under paragraphs (a) (1) through (8) of this section;

(10) Each storage area used to store PCBs and PCB Items for disposal.

(b) As of October 1, 1978, each transport vehicle loaded with PCB Containers that contain more than 45 kg (99.4 lbs.) of liquid PCBs at concentrations of ≥50 ppm or with one or more PCB Transformers shall be marked on each end and each side with the Mmark as described in § 761.45(a).

(c) As of January 1, 1979, the following PCB Articles shall be marked with mark Mas described in § 761.45(a):

(1) All PCB Transformers not marked under paragraph (a) of this section [marking of PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment is not required];

(2) All PCB Large High Voltage Capacitors not marked under paragraph (a) of this section

(i) Will be marked individually with mark M, or

(ii) If one or more PCB Large High Voltage Capacitors are installed in a protected location such as on a power pole, or structure, or behind a fence; the pole, structure, or fence shall be marked with mark M, and a record or procedure identifying the PCB Capacitors shall be maintained by the owner or operator at the protected location.

(d) As of January 1, 1979, all PCB Equipment containing a PCB Small Capacitor shall be marked at the time of manufacture with the statement, "This equipment contains PCB Capacitor(s)". The mark shall be of the same size as the mark M.

(e) As of October 1, 1979, applicable PCB Items in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(6), (a)(7), and (a)(8) of this section containing PCBs in concentrations of 50 to 500 ppm shall be marked with the Mmark as described in § 761.45(a).

(f) Where mark Mis specified but the PCB Article or PCB Equipment is too small to accomodate the smallest permissible size of mark M, mark Mas described in § 761.45(b), may be used instead of mark M.

(g) Each large low voltage capacitor, each small capacitor normally used in alternating current circuits, and each fluorescent light ballast manufactured ("manufactured", for purposes of this sentence, means built) between July 1, 1978 and July 1, 1998 that do not contain PCBs shall be marked by the manufacturer at the time of manufacture with the statement, "No PCBs". The mark shall be of similar durability and readability as other marking that indicate electrical information, part numbers, or the manufacturer's name. For purposes of this paragraph marking requirement only is applicable to items built domestically or abroad after June 30, 1978.

(h) All marks required by this subpart must be placed in a position on the exterior of the PCB Items, storage units, or transport vehicles so that the marks can be easily read by any persons inspecting or servicing the marked PCB Items, storage units, or transport vehicles.

(i) Any chemical substance or mixture that is manufactured after the effective date of this rule and that contains less than 500 ppm PCB (0.05% on a dry weight basis), including PCB that is a byproduct or impurity, must be marked in accordance with any requirements contained in the exemption granted by EPA to permit such manufacture and is not subject to any other requirement in this subpart unless so specified in the exemption. This paragraph applies only to containers of chemical substances or mixtures. PCB articles and equipment into which the chemical substances or mixtures are processed, are subject to the marking requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.

(j) PCB Transformer locations shall be marked as follows:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as of December 1, 1985, the vault door, machinery room door, fence, hallway, or means of access, other than grates and manhole covers, to a PCB Transformer must be marked with the mark Mas required by paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) A mark other than the Mmark may be used provided all of the following conditions are met:

(i) The program using such an alternative mark was initiated prior to August 15, 1985, and can be substantiated with documentation.

(ii) Prior to August 15, 1985, coordination between the transformer owner and the primary fire department occurred, and the primary fire department knows, accepts, and recognizes what the alternative mark means, and that this can be substantiated with documentation.

(iii) The EPA Regional Administrator in the appropriate region is informed in writing of the use of the alternative mark by October 3, 1988 and is provided with documentation that the program began before August 15, 1985, and documentation that demonstrates that prior to that date the primary fire department knew, accepted and recognized the meaning of the mark, and included this information in firefighting training.

(iv) The Regional Administrator will either approve or disapprove in writing the use of an alternative mark within 30 days of receipt of the documentation of a program.

(3) Any mark placed in accordance with the requirements of this section must be placed in the locations described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section and in a manner that can be easily read by emergency response personnel fighting a fire involving this equipment.

(k) As of April 26, 1999 the following PCB Items shall be marked with the Mmark as described in § 761.45(a):

(1) All PCB Large Low Voltage Capacitors not marked under paragraph (a) of this section shall be marked individually, or if one or more PCB Large Low Voltage Capacitors are installed in a protected location such as on a power pole, or structure, or behind a fence, then the owner or operator shall mark the pole, structure, or fence with the Mmark, and maintain a record or procedure identifying the PCB Capacitors at the protected location. PCB Large Low Voltage Capacitors in inaccessible locations inside equipment need not be marked individually, provided the owner or operator marks the equipment in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section, and marks the individual capacitors at the time of removal from use in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) All equipment not marked under paragraph (a) of this section containing a PCB Transformer or a PCB Large High or Low Voltage Capacitor.

(l)(1) All voltage regulators which contain 1.36 kilograms (3 lbs.) or more of dielectric fluid with a PCB concentration of ≥500 ppm must be marked individually with the Mmark as described in § 761.45(a).

(2) Locations of voltage regulators which contain 1.36 kilograms (3 lbs.) or more of dielectric fluid with a PCB concentration of ≥500 ppm shall be marked as follows: The vault door, machinery room door, fence, hallway, or means of access, other than grates or manhole covers, must be marked with the Mmark as described in § 761.45(a).
