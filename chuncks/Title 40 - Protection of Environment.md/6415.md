1.1 Scope. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA or "we") developed this method to describe the procedures that the stack tester ("you") must follow to measure filterable particulate matter (PM) emissions equal to or less than a nominal aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers (PM) and 2.5 micrometers (PM). This method can be used to measure coarse particles (, the difference between the measured PMconcentration and the measured PMconcentration).
