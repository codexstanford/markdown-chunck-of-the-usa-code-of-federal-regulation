####### ยง 1065.295 PM inertial balance for field-testing analysis.
######## Component requirements.

(b)We recommend that you use a balance that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your balance-based system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307. If the balance uses an internal calibration process for routine spanning and linearity verifications, the process must be NIST-traceable.
