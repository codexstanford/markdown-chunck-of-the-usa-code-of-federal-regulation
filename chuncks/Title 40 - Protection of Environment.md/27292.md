(3) Leaks from equipment regulated under § 63.648;

(4) [Reserved]

(5) In situ sampling systems (onstream analyzers) until February 1, 2016. After this date, these sampling systems will be included in the definition of miscellaneous process vents and sampling systems determined to be Group 1 miscellaneous process vents must comply with the requirements in §§ 63.643 and 63.644 no later than January 30, 2019;

(6) Catalytic cracking unit catalyst regeneration vents;

(7) Catalytic reformer regeneration vents;

(8) Sulfur plant vents;

(9) Vents from control devices such as scrubbers, boilers, incinerators, and electrostatic precipitators applied to catalytic cracking unit catalyst regeneration vents, catalytic reformer regeneration vents, and sulfur plant vents;

(10) Vents from any stripping operations applied to comply with the wastewater provisions of this subpart, subpart G of this part, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF;

(11) Emissions associated with delayed coking unit decoking operations;

(12) Vents from storage vessels;

(13) Emissions from wastewater collection and conveyance systems including, but not limited to, wastewater drains, sewer vents, and sump drains; and

(14) Hydrogen production plant vents through which carbon dioxide is removed from process streams or through which steam condensate produced or treated within the hydrogen plant is degassed or deaerated.
