####### Method 18.

(1)The procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.

(i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.

(ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or organic HAP emissions shall be calculated using the following two procedures, as applicable.

(A) The TOC concentration (C) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using Equation 64-1 of this section:

(B) The total organic HAP concentration (C) shall be computed according to the equation in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section except that only the organic HAP species shall be summed.
