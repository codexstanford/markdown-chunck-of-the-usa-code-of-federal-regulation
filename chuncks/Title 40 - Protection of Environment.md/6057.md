####### Purpose and applicability.

(a)The federal conformity rules under part 93, subpart A, of this chapter, in addition to any existing applicable state requirements, establish the conformity criteria and procedures necessary to meet the requirements of Clean Air Act section 176(c) until such time as EPA approves the conformity implementation plan revision required by this subpart. A state with an area subject to this subpart and part 93, subpart A, of this chapter must submit to EPA a revision to its implementation plan which contains criteria and procedures for DOT, MPOs and other state or local agencies to assess the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects, consistent with this subpart and part 93, subpart A, of this chapter. The federal conformity regulations contained in part 93, subpart A, of this chapter would continue to apply for the portion of the requirements that the state did not include in its conformity implementation plan and the portion, if any, of the state's conformity provisions that is not approved by EPA. In addition, any previously applicable implementation plan conformity requirements remain enforceable until the state submits a revision to its applicable implementation plan to specifically remove them and that revision is approved by EPA.
