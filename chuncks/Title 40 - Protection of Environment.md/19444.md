###### § 60.636 Reporting requirements.
####### § 60.643 Compliance provisions.

(a)(1) To determine compliance with the standards for sulfur dioxide specified in § 60.642(a), during the initial performance test as required by § 60.8, the minimum required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency (Z) is compared to the emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur recovery technology.

(i) If R ≥ Z, the affected facility is in compliance.

(ii) If R < Z, the affected facility is not in compliance.

(2) Following the initial determination of compliance as required by § 60.8, any subsequent compliance determinations that may be required by the Administrator would compare R to Z.

(b) The emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur reduction technology shall be determined using the procedures in § 60.644(c)(1).
