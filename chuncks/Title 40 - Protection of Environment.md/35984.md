######## Hazardous air pollutant content or HAP content

means the amount of HAP contained in a regulated material at the time it is applied to the part being manufactured. If no HAP is added to a material as a thinner or diluent, then the HAP content is the same as the HAP content of the material as purchased from the supplier. For resin and gel coat, HAP content does not include any HAP contained in the catalyst added to the resin or gel coat during application to initiate curing.
