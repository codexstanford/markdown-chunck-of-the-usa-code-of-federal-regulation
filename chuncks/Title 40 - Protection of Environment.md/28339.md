####### Startup of an anode bake furnace

means the process of initiating heating to the anode bake furnace. The startup or re-start of the furnace begins when the heating begins. The startup or re-start concludes at the start of the second anode bake cycle if the furnace was at ambient temperature upon startup or when the anode bake cycle resumes if the furnace was not at ambient temperature.
