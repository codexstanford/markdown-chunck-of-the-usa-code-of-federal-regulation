####### i.e.,

6.1.4 Do not calculate the PM emission rate for any unit or stack operating hour in which valid data are not obtained for PM concentration or for any parameter used in the PM emission rate calculations (gross output, stack gas flow rate, stack temperature, stack pressure, stack gas moisture content, or diluent gas concentration, as applicable).

6.1.5 For the purposes of this appendix, part 75 substitute data values for stack gas flow rate, COconcentration, Oconcentration, and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.

6.1.6 Operating hours in which PM concentration is missing or invalid are hours of monitoring system downtime. The use of substitute data for PM concentration is not allowed.

6.1.7 You must exclude all data obtained during a boiler startup or shutdown operating hour (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) from the determination of the 30-boiler operating day rolling average PM emission rates.
