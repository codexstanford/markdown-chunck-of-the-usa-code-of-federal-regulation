###### i.e.

In this section, the owner or operator is required to provide a description of the facility's worst case discharge, as well as a small and medium discharge, as appropriate. A multi-level planning approach has been chosen because the response actions to a discharge (, necessary response equipment, products, and personnel) are dependent on the magnitude of the discharge. Planning for lesser discharges is necessary because the nature of the response may be qualitatively different depending on the quantity of the discharge. The facility owner or operator shall discuss the potential direction of the discharge pathway.

1.5.1.1 To address multi-level planning requirements, the owner or operator must consider types of facility-specific discharge scenarios that may contribute to a small or medium discharge. The scenarios shall account for all the operations that take place at the facility, including but not limited to:

(1) Loading and unloading of surface transportation;

(2) Facility maintenance;

(3) Facility piping;

(4) Pumping stations and sumps;

(5) Oil storage tanks;

(6) Vehicle refueling; and

(7) Age and condition of facility and components.

1.5.1.2 The scenarios shall also consider factors that affect the response efforts required by the facility. These include but are not limited to:

(1) Size of the discharge;

(2) Proximity to downgradient wells, waterways, and drinking water intakes;

(3) Proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments;
