(B)Two concentrations of each test substance shall be used in this portion of the study, a low concentration and a high concentration. The high concentration should induce minimal toxicity, but shall not exceed the lower explosive limit (LEL). The low concentration shall correspond to 1/10 of the high concentration. Inhalation treatment shall be conducted using a "nose-cone" or "head only" apparatus to reduce ingestion of the test substance through "grooming" or dermal absorption.
