3.1This specification is the same as PS 2 section 3.1 with the following additions. Both the CO and Omonitors should be installed at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.
