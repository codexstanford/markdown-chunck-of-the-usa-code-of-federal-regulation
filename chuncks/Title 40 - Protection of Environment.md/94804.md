13. Determine the net count, I, of the filter 2.36 &#xC5; silver peak following the procedure in step 12. Remove the filter from the holder, reverse it, and reattach it to the holder. Determine the net count for the unattenuated silver peak, IScan times may befor measurement of silver peaks than for sample peaks; however, they should bethroughout the analysis.

14. Normalize all raw, net intensities (to correct for instrument instabilities) by referencing them to an external standard (e.g., the 3.34 &#xC5; peak of an &#x3B1;-quartz reference crystal). After each unknown is scanned, determine the net count, I, of the reference specimen following the procedure in step 12. Determine the normalized intensities by dividing the peak intensities by I:
