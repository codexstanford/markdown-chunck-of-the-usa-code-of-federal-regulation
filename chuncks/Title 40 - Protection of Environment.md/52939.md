(c) The CHconcentration of gas from digesters must be determined using ASTM D1946-90 (Reapproved 2006) Standard Practice for Analysis of Reformed Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference§ 98.7). All gas composition monitors shall be calibrated prior to the first reporting year for biogas methane and carbon dioxide content using ASTM D1946-90 (Reapproved 2006) Standard Practice for Analysis of Reformed Gas by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference§ 98.7)and recalibrated either annually or at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer, whichever is more frequent, or whenever the error in the midrange calibration check exceeds +/-10 percent. All monitors shall be maintained as specified by the manufacturer.

(d) All temperature and pressure monitors must be calibrated using the procedures and frequencies specified by the manufacturer. All equipment (temperature and pressure monitors) shall be maintained as specified by the manufacturer.

(e) For digesters with gas collection systems, install, operate, maintain, and calibrate a gas flow meter capable of measuring the volumetric flow rate to provide data for the GHG emissions calculations, using the applicable methods specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section or as specified by the manufacturer.
