####### Compliance determination for NO

(ii). Compliance with the NOemission limit described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section shall be determined based on a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day basis. The rolling 30-boiler-operating-day NOemission rate for the unit shall be calculated for each boiler operating day in accordance with the following procedure: Step one, sum the hourly pounds of NOemitted for the current boiler operating day and the preceding twenty-nine (29) boiler-operating-days to calculate the total pounds of NOemitted over the most recent thirty (30) boiler-operating-day period for that unit; Step two, sum the total heat input, in MMBtu, during the current boiler operating day and the preceding twenty-nine (29) boiler-operating-days to calculate the total heat input over the most recent thirty (30) boiler-operating-day period for that unit; Step three, divide the total amount of NOcalculated from Step one by the total heat input calculated from Step two to calculate the rolling 30-boiler-operating-day NOemission rate, in pounds per MMBtu for that unit. Each rolling 30-boiler-operating-day NOemission rate shall include all emissions and all heat input that occur during all periods within any boiler operating day, including emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction. If a valid NOpounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for the unit, that heat input and NOpounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the rolling 30-boiler-operating-day emission rate.
