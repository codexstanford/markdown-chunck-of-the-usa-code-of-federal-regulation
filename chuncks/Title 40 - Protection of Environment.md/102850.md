######### Procedure.
########## x

(9) While flowing NO and COthrough the gas divider, stabilize the output of the gas divider. Determine the COconcentration from the gas divider output, applying gas property correction as necessary to ensure accurate gas division, or measure it using an NDIR. Record this concentration,, and use it in the quench verification calculations in ยง 1065.675. Alternatively, you may use a simple gas blending device and use an NDIR to determine this COconcentration. If you use an NDIR, it must meet the requirements of this part for laboratory testing and you must span it with the COspan gas from paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
