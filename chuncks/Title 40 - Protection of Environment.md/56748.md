####### Timing of State requests for approval of program revisions to adopt new or revised Federal regulations.

(b)(1) Complete and final State requests for approval of program revisions to adopt new or revised EPA regulations must be submitted to the Administrator not later than 2 years after promulgation of the new or revised EPA regulations, unless the State requests an extension and the Administrator has approved the request pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the State expects to submit a final State request for approval of a program revision to EPA more than 2 years after promulgation of the new or revised EPA regulations, the State shall request an extension of the deadline before the expiration of the 2-year period.

(2) The final date for submission of a complete and final State request for a program revision may be extended by EPA for up to a two-year period upon a written application by the State to the Administrator. In the extension application the State must demonstrate it is requesting the extension because it cannot meet the original deadline for reasons beyond its control despite a good faith effort to do so. The application must include a schedule for the submission of a final request by a certain time and provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the State:

(i)(A) Currently lacks the legislative or regulatory authority to enforce the new or revised requirements, or

(B) Currently lacks the program capability adequate to implement the new or revised requirements; or

(C) Is requesting the extension to group two or more program revisions in a single legislative or regulatory action; and

(ii) Is implementing the EPA requirements to be adopted by the State in its program revision pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section within the scope of its current authority and capabilities.

(3) To be granted an extension, the State must agree with EPA to meet certain requirements during the extension period, which may include the following types of activities as determined appropriate by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis:

(i) Informing public water systems of the new EPA (and upcoming State) requirements and that EPA will be overseeing implementation of the requirements until the State, if eligible for interim primacy, submits a complete and final primacy revision request to EPA, or in all other cases, until EPA approves the State program revision;

(ii) Collecting, storing and managing laboratory results, public notices, and other compliance and operation data required by the EPA regulations;

(iii) Assisting EPA in the development of the technical aspects of enforcement actions and conducting informal follow-up on violations (telephone calls, letters, etc.);

(iv) Providing technical assistance to public water systems;

(v) Providing EPA with all information prescribed by ยง 142.15 of this part on State reporting; and

(vi) For States whose request for an extension is based on a current lack of program capability adequate to implement the new requirements, taking steps agreed to by EPA and the State during the extension period to remedy the deficiency.
