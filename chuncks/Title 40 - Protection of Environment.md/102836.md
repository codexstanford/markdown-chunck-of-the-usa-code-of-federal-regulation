(9) Divide the mean CHconcentration by the reference concentration of CH, converted to a Cbasis. The result is the combined CHresponse factor and CHpenetration fraction,. Use this combined CHresponse factor and CHpenetration fraction according to ยง 1065.660(b)(2)(iii) or (d)(1)(iii) or ยง 1065.665, as applicable.

(10) Introduce the CHanalytical gas mixture upstream of the nonmethane cutter. Use good engineering judgment to address the effect of hydrocarbon contamination if your point of introduction is vastly different from the point of zero/span gas introduction.

(11) Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization time may include time to purge the nonmethane cutter and to account for the analyzer's response.

(12) While the analyzer measures a stable concentration, record 30 seconds of sampled data. Calculate the arithmetic mean of these data points.

(13) Reroute the flow path to bypass the nonmethane cutter, introduce the CHanalytical gas mixture, and repeat the steps in paragraphs (e)(11) and (12) of this section.
