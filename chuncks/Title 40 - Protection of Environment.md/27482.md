####### Calculation methods for determining the net heating value dilution parameter.

(n)The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value dilution parameter (NHV) as specified in paragraph (n)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section, determine the 15-minute block average NHVbased on the 15-minute block average vent gas and perimeter assist air flow rates using the following equation only during periods when perimeter assist air is used. For 15-minute block periods when there is no cumulative volumetric flow of perimeter assist air, the 15-minute block average NHVparameter does not need to be calculated.

(2) Owners or operators of flares that use the feed-forward calculation methodology in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section and that monitor gas composition or net heating value in a location representative of the cumulative vent gas stream and that directly monitor flare supplemental gas flow additions to the flare must determine the 15-minute block average NHVusing the following equation only during periods when perimeter assist air is used. For 15-minute block periods when there is no cumulative volumetric flow of perimeter assist air, the 15-minute block average NHVparameter does not need to be calculated.
