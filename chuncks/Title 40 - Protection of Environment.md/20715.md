######## Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit.

(c)Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
