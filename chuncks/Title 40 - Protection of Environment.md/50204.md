(a)(1) CSAPR NOAnnual allowances are allocated, for the control periods in 2015 and each year thereafter, as provided in a notice of data availability issued by the Administrator. Providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NOAnnual unit, and not providing an allocation to a unit in such notice does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NOAnnual unit.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a unit provided an allocation in the notice of data availability issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not operate, starting after 2014, during the control period in two consecutive years, such unit will not be allocated the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances provided in such notice for the unit for the control periods in the fifth year after the first such year and in each year after that fifth year. All CSAPR NOAnnual allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to such unit will be allocated to the new unit set-aside for the State where such unit is located and for the respective years involved. If such unit resumes operation, the Administrator will allocate CSAPR NOAnnual allowances to the unit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
