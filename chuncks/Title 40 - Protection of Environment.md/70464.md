###### Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value.

4.1.3.2.1.4Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from table 4-12, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from table 4-16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in table 4-1.
