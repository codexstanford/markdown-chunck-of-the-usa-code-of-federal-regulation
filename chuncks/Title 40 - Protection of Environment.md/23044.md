####### Sources following the stripper(s).

(e)The following requirements apply to emissions of vinyl chloride to the atmosphere from the combination of all sources following the stripper(s) [or the reactor(s) if the plant has no stripper(s)] in the plant process flow including but not limited to, centrifuges, concentrators, blend tanks, filters, dryers, conveyor air discharges, baggers, storage containers, and inprocess wastewater, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section:

(1) In polyvinyl chloride plants using stripping technology to control vinyl chloride emissions, the weighted average residual vinyl chloride concentration in all grades of polyvinyl chloride resin processed through the stripping operation on each calendar day, measured immediately after the stripping operation is completed, may not exceed:

(i) 2000 ppm for polyvinyl chloride dispersion resins, excluding latex resins;

(ii) 400 ppm for all other polyvinyl chloride resins, including latex resins, averaged separately for each type of resin; or

(2) In polyvinyl chloride plants controlling vinyl chloride emissions with technology other than stripping or in addition to stripping, emissions of vinyl chloride to the atmosphere may not exceed:

(i) 2 g/kg (4 lb/ton) product from the stripper(s) [or reactor(s) if the plant has no stripper(s)] for dispersion polyvinyl chloride resins, excluding latex resins, with the product determined on a dry solids basis;

(ii) 0.4 g/kg (0.8 lb/ton) product from the strippers [or reactor(s) if the plant has no stripper(s)] for all other polyvinyl chloride resins, including latex resins, with the product determined on a dry solids basis.

(3) The provisions of this paragraph apply at all times including when off-specification or other types of resins are made.
