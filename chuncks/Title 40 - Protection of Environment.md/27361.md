Emission factors shall be based on test data or emission estimation procedures specified in ยง 63.565(l) of subpart Y.

(ii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate EMV:

(A) If the marine tank vessel is not controlled, EMV= EMV, where EMVis calculated using the equations specified in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section.

(B) If the marine tank vessel is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 97-percent reduction,
