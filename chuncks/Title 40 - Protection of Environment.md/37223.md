######## Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration

means the fraction by weight of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are contained in the remediation material as measured using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A and expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, you may determine the HAP concentration of the remediation material using any one of the other test methods specified in ยง 63.694(b)(2)(ii). When a test method specified in ยง 63.694(b)(2)(ii) other than Method 305 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of the contaminated material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding flisted in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.
