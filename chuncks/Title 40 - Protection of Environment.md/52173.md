####### Reporting of 2011 and subsequent year emissions using scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations developed after approval to use best available monitoring methods expires.

(iii)Facilities that are approved to use best available monitoring methods in 2011 and subsequent years for scoping speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations for certain processes must submit, by March 31 of the year that begins one year after their approval to use best available monitoring method(s) expires, revised emission estimates for 2011 and subsequent years that reflect the scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations that are measured for those processes in 2013 or subsequent years. If the operating scenario for 2011 or subsequent years is different from all of the operating scenarios for which emission factors or emission characterizations are developed in 2013 or subsequent years, use Equation L-23 of ยง 98.123(c)(3)(viii) to adjust the emission factor(s) or emission characterization(s) measured for the new operating scenario(s) to account for the differences.
