####### Determinations based on trial burn.

(f)During each approved trial burn (or as soon after the burn as is practicable), the applicant must make the following determinations:

(1) A quantitative analysis of the levels of antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, thallium, silver, and chlorine/chloride, in the feed streams (hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks);

(2) When a DRE trial burn is required under § 266.104(a) of this chapter:

(i) A quantitative analysis of the trial POHCs in the hazardous waste feed;

(ii) A quantitative analysis of the stack gas for the concentration and mass emissions of the trial POHCs; and

(iii) A computation of destruction and removal efficiency (DRE), in accordance with the DRE formula specified in § 266.104(a) of this chapter;

(3) When a trial burn for chlorinated dioxins and furans is required under § 266.104(e) of this chapter, a quantitative analysis of the stack gas for the concentration and mass emission rate of the 2,3,7,8-chlorinated tetra-octa congeners of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans, and a computation showing conformance with the emission standard;

(4) When a trial burn for particulate matter, metals, or HCl/Clis required under §§ 266.105, 266.106 (c) or (d), or 266.107 (b)(2) or (c) of this chapter, a quantitative analysis of the stack gas for the concentrations and mass emissions of particulate matter, metals, or hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine (Cl), and computations showing conformance with the applicable emission performance standards;

(5) When a trial burn for DRE, metals, or HCl/Clis required under §§ 266.104(a), 266.106 (c) or (d), or 266.107 (b)(2) or (c) of this chapter, a quantitative analysis of the scrubber water (if any), ash residues, other residues, and products for the purpose of estimating the fate of the trial POHCs, metals, and chlorine/chloride;

(6) An identification of sources of fugitive emissions and their means of control;

(7) A continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and where required, hydrocarbons (HC), in the stack gas; and

(8) Such other information as the Director may specify as necessary to ensure that the trial burn will determine compliance with the performance standards in §§ 266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and to establish the operating conditions required by § 266.102(e) of this chapter as necessary to meet those performance standards.
