###### 13.3 Drift.

For each run, the low-level and upscale drift must be less than or equal to 3.0 percent of the calibration span. The drift is also acceptable if the pre- and post-run bias (or the pre- and post-run system calibration error) responses do not differ by more than 0.5 ppmv at each gas concentration (i.e. | C- C| &#x2264;0.5 ppmv).
