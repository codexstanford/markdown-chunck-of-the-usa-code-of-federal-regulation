(D)If the vent stream entering a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel, the weight-percent reduction of total organic regulated material or TOC (minus methane and ethane) across the device shall be determined by comparing the TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic regulated material in all combusted vent streams and primary and secondary fuels with the TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic regulated material exiting the combustion device, respectively.
