###### § 75.4 Compliance dates.
####### i.e.,

(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall ensure that all required certification and/or recertification and/or diagnostic tests of the monitoring systems required under this part (the SO, NO, CO, O, opacity, volumetric flow rate, and moisture monitoring systems, as applicable) are completed not later than 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days (whichever occurs first) after:

(i) For the event of construction of a new stack or flue, the date that emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue, notice of which date shall be provided under subpart G of this part; or

(ii) For the event of installation of a flue gas desulfurization system or add-on NOemission controls, the date that reagent is first injected into the flue gas desulfurization system or the add-on NOemission controls, as applicable, notice of which date shall be provided under subpart G of this part.

(2) The owner or operator shall determine and report, as applicable, SOconcentration, NOconcentration, NOemission rate, COconcentration, Oconcentration, volumetric flow rate, and moisture data for all unit or stack operating hours after emissions first pass through the new stack or flue, or reagent is first injected into the flue gas desulfurization system or add-on NOemission controls, as applicable, until all required certification and/or recertification and/or diagnostic tests are successfully completed, using:

(i) Quality-assured data recorded by a previously-certified monitoring system for which the event requires no additional testing;

(ii) The applicable missing data substitution procedures under §§ 75.31 through 75.37;

(iii) The conditional data validation procedures of § 75.20(b)(3), except that conditional data validation may, if necessary, be used for the entire window of time provided under paragraph (e)(1) of this section in lieu of the periods specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv);

(iv) Reference methods under § 75.22(b);
