(a)(1) The owner and operator of each source located within the State of Minnesota and for which requirements are set forth under the Federal CAIR NOAnnual Trading Program in subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PMrelating to NOunder ยง 51.123 of this chapter, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under ยง 51.123(p) of this chapter.

(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated CAIR NOallowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NOallowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP provision that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NOallowances for those years.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, such paragraph is not applicable as it relates to sources in the State of Minnesota as of December 3, 2009, except that:

(1) The owner and operator of each source referenced in such paragraph in whose compliance account any allocation of CAIR NOallowances was recorded under the Federal CAIR NOAnnual Trading Program in part 97 of this chapter shall hold in that compliance account, as of midnight of December 3, 2009 and with regard to each such recorded allocation, CAIR NOallowances that are usable in such trading program, issued for the same year as the recorded allocation, and in the same amount as the recorded allocation. The owner and operator shall hold such allowances for the purpose of deduction by the Administrator under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) After December 3, 2009, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of each source in the State of Minnesota any CAIR NOallowances required to be held in that compliance account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Administrator will not deduct, for purposes of implementing the stay, any other CAIR NOallowances held in that compliance account and, starting no later than December 3, 2009, will not record any allocation of CAIR NOallowances included in the State trading budget for Minnesota for any year.

(c)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Minnesota and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOAnnual Trading Program in subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units in the State will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan under ยง 52.38(a) for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's SIP.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Minnesota's SIP revision described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR NOAnnual allowances under subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR NOAnnual allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.
