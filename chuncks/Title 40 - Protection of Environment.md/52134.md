####### Operating scenario change that affects the emission factor.

(ii)For planned operating scenario changes, you must estimate and compare the emission calculation factors for the changed operating scenario and for the original operating scenario whose process vent specific emission factor was measured. Use the calculation methods in ยง 98.123(c)(4). If the emission calculation factor for the changed operating scenario is 15 percent or more different from the emission calculation factor for the previous operating scenario (this includes the cumulative change in the emission calculation factor since the last emissions test), you must conduct an emissions test to update the process-vent-specific emission factor, unless the difference between the operating scenarios is solely due to the application of a destruction device to emissions under the changed operating scenario. Conduct the test before February 28 of the year that immediately follows the change. In the calculations under ยง 98.123, apply the revised process-vent-specific emission factor to the process activity that occurs after the operating scenario change.
