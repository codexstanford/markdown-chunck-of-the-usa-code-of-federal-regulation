####### Torque broadcasting.

(b)Starting in the 2013 model year, electronically controlled engines must broadcast their speed and output shaft torque (in newton-meters). Engines may alternatively broadcast a surrogate value for determining torque. Engines must broadcast engine parameters such that they can be read with a remote device, or broadcast them directly to their controller area networks. Your broadcasting protocol must allow for valid measurements using the field-testing procedures in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J.
