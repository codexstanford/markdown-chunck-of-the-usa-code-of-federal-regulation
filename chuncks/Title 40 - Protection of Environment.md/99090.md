###### Final reduced fee calculation and adjustment.

(d)(1) If the initial fee payment is less than the final reduced fee, you must pay the difference between the initial reduced fee and the final reduced fee using the provisions of ยง 1027.130. Calculate the final reduced fee using the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section but using actual production figures rather than projections and actual retail sales value rather than projected retail sales value.

The total fees paid for a certificate may not exceed the applicable full fee specified in ยง 1027.105. We may void the applicable certificate if you fail to make a complete payment within the specified period. We may also refuse to grant reduced fee requests submitted under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

(3) If the initial fee payment exceeds the final reduced fee, you may request a refund using the procedures of ยง 1027.125.
