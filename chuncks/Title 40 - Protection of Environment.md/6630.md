###### Data Reduction.

5The State plan shall require owners or operators of affected facilities to use the following procedures for converting monitoring data to units of the standard where necessary.

5.1 For fossil fuel-fired steam generators the following procedures shall be used to convert gaseous emission monitoring data in parts per million to g/million cal (lb/million BTU) where necessary:

5.1.1 When the owner or operator of a fossil fuel-fired steam generator elects under paragraph 2.1.4 of this appendix to measure oxygen in the flue gases, the measurements of the pollutant concentration and oxygen concentration shall each be on a dry basis and the following conversion procedure used:

5.1.2 When the owner or operator elects under paragraph 2.1.4 of this appendix to measure carbon dioxide in the flue gases, the measurement of the pollutant concentration and the carbon dioxide concentration shall each be on a consistent basis (wet or dry) and the following conversion procedure used:

5.1.3 The values used in the equations under paragraph 5.1 are derived as follows:

E = pollutant emission, g/million cal (lb/million BTU),

C = pollutant concentration, g/dscm (lb/dscf), determined by multiplying the average concentration (ppm) for each hourly period by 4.16 x 10M g/dscm per ppm (2.64 x 10M lb/dscf per ppm) where M = pollutant molecular weight, g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole). M = 64 for sulfur dioxide and 46 for oxides of nitrogen.

%O, %CO= Oxygen or carbon dioxide volume (expressed as percent) determined with equipment specified under paragraphs 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of this appendix.

5.2 For sulfuric acid plants the owner or operator shall:

5.2.1 establish a conversion factor three times daily according to the procedures to ยง 60.84(b) of this chapter;

5.2.2 multiply the conversion factor by the average sulfur dioxide concentration in the flue gases to obtain average sulfur dioxide emissions in Kg/metric ton (lb/short ton); and

5.2.3 report the average sulfur dioxide emission for each averaging period in excess of the applicable emission standard in the reports submitted as specified in paragraph 4.1 of this appendix.

5.3 For nitric acid plants the owner or operator shall:

5.3.1 establish a conversion factor according to the procedures of ยง 60.73(b) of this chapter;

5.3.2 multiply the conversion factor by the average nitrogen oxides concentration in the flue gases to obtain the nitrogen oxides emissions in the units of the applicable standard;

5.3.3 report the average nitrogen oxides emission for each averaging period in excess of the applicable emission standard, in the reports submitted as specified in paragraph 4.1 of this appendix.

5.4 Any State may allow data reporting or reduction procedures varying from those set forth in this appendix if the owner or operator of a source shows to the satisfaction of the State that his procedures are at least as accurate as those in this appendix. Such procedures may include but are not limited to, the following:

5.4.1 Alternative procedures for computing emission averages that do not require integration of data (e.g., some facilities may demonstrate that the variability of their emissions is sufficiently small to allow accurate reduction of data based upon computing averages from equally spaced data points over the averaging period).

5.4.2 Alternative methods of converting pollutant concentration measurements to the units of the emission standards.
