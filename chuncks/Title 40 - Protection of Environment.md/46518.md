(8) EPA may voida certificate of conformity for vehicle or engine families introduced into commerce if the manufacturer (or contractor for the manufacturer, if applicable) fails to comply with any provision of this section.

(e) EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives are authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant whether or not the Enforcement Officers first attempted to seek permission of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section.

(f) A manufacturer shall permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives who present a warrant or court order as described in paragraph (e) of this section to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section and as described in the warrant or court order. The manufacturer shall cause those in charge of its facility or facility operated for its benefit to permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section pursuant to a warrant or court order whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility. In the absence of such a warrant or court order, EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section only upon the consent of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question.

(g) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air Act for any person to refuse to permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section without a warrant or court order.
