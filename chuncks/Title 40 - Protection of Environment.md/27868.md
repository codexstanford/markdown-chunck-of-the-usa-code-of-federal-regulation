####### Depainting operation.

(d)Each owner or operator of a depainting operation subject to this subpart shall submit the following information:

(1) Semiannual reports occurring every 6 months from the date of the notification of compliance status that identify:

(i) Any 24-hour period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting of aerospace vehicles, other than from the exempt operations listed in ยง 63.746 (a), (b)(3), and (b)(5).

(ii) Any new chemical strippers used at the facility during the reporting period;

(iii) The organic HAP content of these new chemical strippers;

(iv) For each chemical stripper that undergoes reformulation, its organic HAP content;

(v) Any new non-chemical depainting technique in use at the facility since the notification of compliance status or any subsequent semiannual report was filed;

(vi) For periods of malfunctions:

(A) The non-chemical method or technique that malfunctioned;

(B) The date that the malfunction occurred;

(C) A description of the malfunction;

(D) The methods used to depaint aerospace vehicles during the malfunction period;

(E) The dates that these methods were begun and discontinued; and

(F) The date that the malfunction was corrected;

(vii) All periods where a nonchemical depainting operation subject to ยง 63.746(b)(2) and (b)(4) for the control of inorganic HAP emissions was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop, water flow rate, or recommended booth parameter(s) was outside the limit(s) specified by the filter or booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operational procedures;

(viii) A list of new and discontinued aircraft models depainted at the facility over the last 6 months and a list of the parts normally removed for depainting for each new aircraft model being depainted; and

(ix) If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the semiannual period, a statement signed by a responsible company official that the operation was in compliance with the applicable standards.

(2) Annual reports occurring every 12 months from the date of the notification of compliance status that identify:

(i) The average volume per aircraft of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers or weight of organic HAP used for spot stripping and decal removal operations if it exceeds the limits specified in ยง 63.746(b)(3); and

(ii) The number of times the pressure drop limit(s) for each filter system or the number of times the water flow rate limit(s) for each waterwash system were outside the limit(s) specified by the filter or booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures.

(3) Where a control device is used to control organic HAP emissions, semiannual reports that identify:

(i) If a carbon adsorber is used,

(A) each rolling period when the overall control efficiency of the control system is calculated to be less than 81% for existing systems or less than 95% for new systems, the initial material balance calculation, and any exceedances as demonstrated through the calculation; or,

(B) for nonregenerative carbon adsorbers, submit the design evaluation, the continuous monitoring system performance report, and any excess emissions as demonstrated through deviations of monitored values.

(ii) For control devices other than a carbon adsorber, each exceedance of the operating parameter(s) established for the control device under the initial performance test during which compliance was demonstrated;

(iii) Descriptions of any control devices currently in use that were not listed in the notification of compliance status or any subsequent report.
