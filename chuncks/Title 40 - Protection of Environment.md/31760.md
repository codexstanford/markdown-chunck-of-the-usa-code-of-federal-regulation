(5)For each process, the owner or operator of a new source shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(5)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.

(i) The uncontrolled HCl and Clemissions, including HCl generated from combustion of halogenated process vent emissions, from the sum of all process vents within a process shall not exceed 6.8 Mg/yr.

(ii) If HCl and Clemissions, including HCl generated from combustion of halogenated process vent emissions, from the sum of all process vents within a process are greater than 6.8 Mg/yr and less than or equal to 191 Mg/yr, these HCl and Clemissions shall be reduced by 94 percent or to an outlet concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv.

(iii) If HCl and Clemissions, including HCl generated from combustion of halogenated process vent emissions, from the sum of all process vents within a process are greater than 191 Mg/yr, these HCl and Clemissions shall be reduced by 99 percent or greater or to an outlet concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv.
