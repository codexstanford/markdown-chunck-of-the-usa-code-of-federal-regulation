####### Lead reclamation facility

(e)means the facility that casts remelted lead scrap generated by onsite lead acid battery manufacturing processes into lead ingots for use in the battery manufacturing process, and which is not a furnace affected under subpart L of this part. Lead scrap remelting processes that are used directly (not cast into an ingot first) in a grid casting facility or a three-process operation facility are parts of those facilities and are not part of a lead reclamation facility.
