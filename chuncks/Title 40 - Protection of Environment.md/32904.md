####### ยง 63.1573 What are my monitoring alternatives?
######## Can I monitor other process or control device operating parameters?

(e)You may request approval to monitor parameters other than those required in this subpart. You must request approval if:

(1) You use a control device other than a thermal incinerator, boiler, process heater, flare, electrostatic precipitator, or wet scrubber;

(2) You use a combustion control device (e.g., incinerator, flare, boiler or process heater with a design heat capacity of at least 44 MW, boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone), electrostatic precipitator, or scrubber but want to monitor a parameter other than those specified; or

(3) You wish to use another type of continuous emission monitoring system that provides direct measurement of a pollutant (i.e., a PM or multi-metals HAP continuous emission monitoring system, a carbonyl sulfide/carbon disulfide continuous emission monitoring system, a TOC continuous emission monitoring system, or HCl continuous emission monitoring system).
