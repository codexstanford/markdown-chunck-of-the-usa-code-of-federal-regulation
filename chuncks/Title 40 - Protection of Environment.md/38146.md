######## Unit with multiple parallel control devices with multiple stacks.

(6)If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured such that emissions are controlled with multiple parallel control devices or multiple series of control devices are discharged to the atmosphere through more than one stack, you shall install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems described in each of the multiple stacks. You shall calculate hourly flow-weighted average pollutant emission rates for the unit as follows:

(i) Calculate the pollutant emission rate at each stack or duct for each hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters;

(ii) Multiply each calculated hourly pollutant emission rate at each stack or duct by the corresponding hourly stack gas flow rate at that stack or duct;

(iii) Sum the products determined under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section; and

(iv) Divide the result obtained in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section by the total hourly stack gas flow rate for the unit, summed across all of the stacks or ducts.
