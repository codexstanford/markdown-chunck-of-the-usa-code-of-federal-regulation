###### Level of contamination at a sampling location.

7.3.1Determine whether Level I or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated targets) as follows:

- Select the benchmarks from section 7.3.2 applicable to the pathway (or component or threat) being evaluated.

- Compare the concentrations of radionuclides in the sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the pathway (or component or threat) as specified in section 7.3.2. Treat comparable samples as specified in section 2.5.1.

- Determine which level applies based on this comparison.

- If none of the radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location have an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (or component or threat).

- In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only those radionuclides in the sample, that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used for the human food chain threat of the surface water pathway as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.
