(d)-The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Pointe Coupee Parish on December 20, 1995. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Louisiana ozone State Implementation Plan for Pointe Coupee Parish. The EPA therefore approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to ozone for Pointe Coupee Parish on December 20, 1996.
