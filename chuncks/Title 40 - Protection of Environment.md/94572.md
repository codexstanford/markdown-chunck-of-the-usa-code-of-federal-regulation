(5) At any time, a local education agency may analyze air monitoring samples collected for clearance purposes by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) to confirm completion of removal, encapsulation, or enclosure of ACBM that is greater than small-scale, short-duration and less than or equal to 160 square feet or 260 linear feet. The action shall be considered complete when the results of samples collected in the affected functional space and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7400 entitled "Fibers" published in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods, 3rd Edition, Second Supplement, August 1987, show that the concentration of fibers for each of the five samples is less than or equal to a limit of quantitation for PCM (0.01 fibers per cubic centimeter (0.01 f/cm) of air). The method is available at the addresses in ยง 700.17(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter. For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The method is incorporated as it exists on the effective date of this rule, and a notice of any change to the method will be published in the

(6) To determine the amount of ACBM affected under paragraph (i)(5) of this section, the local education agency shall add the total square or linear footage of ACBM within the containment barriers used to isolate the functional space for the action to remove, encapsulate, or enclose the ACBM. Contiguous portions of material subject to such action conducted concurrently or at approximately the same time within the same school building shall not be separated to qualify under paragraph (i)(5), of this section.
