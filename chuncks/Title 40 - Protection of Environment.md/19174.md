(ii) Does not follow required procedures or practices;

(iii) Has falsified data or otherwise misrepresented emission data;

(iv) Has failed to participate in a proficiency testing program, in accordance with its commitment under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; or

(v) Has failed to seal a wood heater in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section.
