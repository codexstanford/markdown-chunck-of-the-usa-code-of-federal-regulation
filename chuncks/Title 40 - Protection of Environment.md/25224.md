##### Subpart A - General Provisions
###### § 63.10 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
####### General recordkeeping requirements.

(b)(1) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by this part recorded in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review. The files shall be retained for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. At a minimum, the most recent 2 years of data shall be retained on site. The remaining 3 years of data may be retained off site. Such files may be maintained on microfilm, on a computer, on computer floppy disks, on magnetic tape disks, or on microfiche.

(2) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain relevant records for such source of-

(i) The occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown when the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards;

(ii) The occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (i.e., process equipment) or the required air pollution control and monitoring equipment;

(iii) All required maintenance performed on the air pollution control and monitoring equipment;

(iv)(A) Actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown when the source exceeded applicable emission limitations in a relevant standard and when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)); or

(B) Actions taken during periods of malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3));

(v) All information necessary, including actions taken, to demonstrate conformance with the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)) when all actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), and malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) are consistent with the procedures specified in such plan. (The information needed to demonstrate conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan may be recorded using a "checklist," or some other effective form of recordkeeping, in order to minimize the recordkeeping burden for conforming events);

(vi) Each period during which a CMS is malfunctioning or inoperative (including out-of-control periods);

(vii) All required measurements needed to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard (including, but not limited to, 15-minute averages of CMS data, raw performance testing measurements, and raw performance evaluation measurements, that support data that the source is required to report);

(A) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the reportable form of the standard.

(B) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.

(C) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all measurements as required by paragraph (b)(2)(vii), if the administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected source.

(viii) All results of performance tests, CMS performance evaluations, and opacity and visible emission observations;

(ix) All measurements as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests and performance evaluations;

(x) All CMS calibration checks;

(xi) All adjustments and maintenance performed on CMS;

(xii) Any information demonstrating whether a source is meeting the requirements for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this part, if the source has been granted a waiver under paragraph (f) of this section;

(xiii) All emission levels relative to the criterion for obtaining permission to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test, if the source has been granted such permission under § 63.8(f)(6); and

(xiv) All documentation supporting initial notifications and notifications of compliance status under § 63.9.
