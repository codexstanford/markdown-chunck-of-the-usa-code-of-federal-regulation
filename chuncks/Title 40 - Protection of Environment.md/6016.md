####### Test sequence.

(b)(1) The test sequence shall consist of a first-chance test and a second-chance test as follows:

(i) The first-chance test, as described under paragraph (VI)(c) of this appendix, shall consist of a first-chance high-speed mode followed immediately by a first-chance idle mode.

(ii) The second-chance test as described under paragraph (VI)(d) of this appendix shall be performed only if the vehicle fails the first-chance test.

(2) The test sequence shall begin only after the following requirements are met:

(i) The vehicle shall be tested in as-received condition with the transmission in neutral or park and all accessories turned off. The engine shall be at normal operating temperature (as indicated by a temperature gauge, temperature lamp, touch test on the radiator hose, or other visual observation for overheating).

(ii) For all pre-1996 model year vehicles, a tachometer shall be attached to the vehicle in accordance with the analyzer manufacturer's instructions. For 1996 and newer model year vehicles the OBD data link connector will be used to monitor rpm. In the event that an OBD data link connector is not available or that an rpm signal is not available over the data link connector, a tachometer shall be used instead.

(iii) The sample probe shall be inserted into the vehicle's tailpipe to a minimum depth of 10 inches. If the vehicle's exhaust system prevents insertion to this depth, a tailpipe extension shall be used.

(iv) The measured concentration of CO plus COshall be greater than or equal to six percent.
