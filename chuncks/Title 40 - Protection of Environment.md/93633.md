(2) All preparation, cleanup, disposal, and post-abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures.

(3) Specifically, abatement includes, but is not limited to:

(i) Projects for which there is a written contract or other documentation, which provides that an individual or firm will be conducting activities in or to a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility that:

(A) Shall result in the permanent elimination of lead-based paint hazards; or

(B) Are designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards and are described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.

(ii) Projects resulting in the permanent elimination of lead-based paint hazards, conducted by firms or individuals certified in accordance with ยง 745.226, unless such projects are covered by paragraph (4) of this definition;

(iii) Projects resulting in the permanent elimination of lead-based paint hazards, conducted by firms or individuals who, through their company name or promotional literature, represent, advertise, or hold themselves out to be in the business of performing lead-based paint activities as identified and defined by this section, unless such projects are covered by paragraph (4) of this definition; or

(iv) Projects resulting in the permanent elimination of lead-based paint hazards, that are conducted in response to State or local abatement orders.

(4) Abatement does not include renovation, remodeling, landscaping or other activities, when such activities are not designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards, but, instead, are designed to repair, restore, or remodel a given structure or dwelling, even though these activities may incidentally result in a reduction or elimination of lead-based paint hazards. Furthermore, abatement does not include interim controls, operations and maintenance activities, or other measures and activities designed to temporarily, but not permanently, reduce lead-based paint hazards.
