(i)(A) Indiana Administrative Code Rules 326 IAC 2-1.1-9.5. Adopted by the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board October 3, 2001. Filed with the Secretary of State December 20, 2001. Effective January 19, 2002. Published at Indiana Register, Volume 25, Number 5, February 1, 2002.

(152) On December 19, 2001, Indiana submitted revised Particulate Matter (PM) control requirements. A March 17, 2003 letter from Indiana clarified what portions of the original submission the State was seeking revisions for. EPA is approving revisions for certain natural gas combustion sources in Indiana and various cleanup revisions to Indiana's PM rules. One revision eliminates PM emissions limits on specified natural gas combustion sources and replaces the limits with a requirement that such sources may only burn natural gas. The submission also contains many cleanup provisions such as eliminating limits for sources which have shut down and updating names of sources.
