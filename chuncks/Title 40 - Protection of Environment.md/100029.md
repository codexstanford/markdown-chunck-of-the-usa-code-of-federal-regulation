## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter U - Air Pollution Controls
#### PART 1037 - CONTROL OF EMISSIONS FROM NEW HEAVY-DUTY MOTOR VEHICLES
##### Subpart B - Emission Standards and Related Requirements
###### ยง 1037.101 Overview of emission standards.
####### Fuel evaporative and refueling emissions.
############# ยง 1037.102 Exhaust emission standards for NO, HC, PM, and CO.

(a) Engines installed in heavy-duty vehicles are subject to criteria pollutant standards for NO, HC, PM, and CO under 40 CFR part 86 through model year 2026 and 40 CFR part 1036 for model years 2027 and later.

(b) Heavy-duty vehicles with no installed propulsion engine, such as electric vehicles, are subject to criteria pollutant standards under this part. The emission standards that apply are the same as the standards that apply for compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR 86.007-11 and 1036.104 for a given model year.

(1) You may state in the application for certification that vehicles with no installed propulsion engine comply with all the requirements of this part related to criteria emission standards instead of submitting test data. Tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants from vehicles with no installed propulsion engine are deemed to be zero.

(2) Vehicles with no installed propulsion engines may not generate NOcredits.
