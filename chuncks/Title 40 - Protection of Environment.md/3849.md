(d)(1) The owner or operator of the project shall not begin actual construction on the project without obtaining a nonattainment New Source Review permit regulating emissions of air pollutants. The EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator has the authority to issue such a permit. Any permit issued by EPA shall ensure that the project meets the following requirements:

(i) By the time the project is to commence operation, the owner or operator of the project must have obtained sufficient reductions in actual emissions from existing facilities within the same nonattainment area which satisfy the requirements of section 173 of the Clean Air Act, to offset the potential to emit of the project;

(ii) The owner or operator of the project must comply with the lowest achievable emissions rate;

(iii) The owner or operator of the project must demonstrate that all major stationary sources owned or operated by such person (or by any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person) located on the reservation of the SRPMIC are subject to emission limitations and are in compliance, or on a schedule for compliance, with all applicable emission limitations and standards under the Act; and

(iv) The owner or operator of the project has provided an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for the proposed source which demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location or construction.

(2) If the owner or operator constructs or operates the project not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or if the owner or operator subject to this section commences construction after January 24 , 2000 without applying for and receiving approval under this section, then the owner or operator shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.

(3) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified.

(4) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the Federal implementation plan and any other requirements under Tribal or Federal law.
