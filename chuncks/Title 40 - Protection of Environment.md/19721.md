####### Total enclosure

means a structure that is constructed around a source of emissions and operated so that all VOC emissions are collected and exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure.
