####### § 63.4161 How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
######## Calculate the organic HAP emission rate.

(k)Determine the organic HAP emission rate to the atmosphere, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids used during the compliance period, using Equation 4 of this section.

(l) To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limit, calculated using Equation 4 of this section, must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4110, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.4092 and the work practice standards required by § 63.4093.
