####### Calculated raw exhaust molar flow rate from measured intake air molar flow rate or fuel mass flow rate.,[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]

(f)You may calculate the raw exhaust molar flow rate from which you sampled emissions,, based on the measured intake air molar flow rate,, or the measured fuel mass flow rate,, and the values calculated using the chemical balance in paragraph (c) of this section. The chemical balance must be based on raw exhaust gas concentrations. Solve for the chemical balance in paragraph (c) of this section at the same frequency that you update and record oror. For laboratory tests, calculating raw exhaust molar flow rate using measured fuel mass flow rate is valid only for steady-state testing. See ยง 1065.915(d)(5)(iv) for application to field testing.
