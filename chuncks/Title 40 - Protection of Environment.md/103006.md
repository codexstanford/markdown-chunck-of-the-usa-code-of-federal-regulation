##### Subpart F - Performing an Emission Test Over Specified Duty Cycles
###### § 1065.510 Engine mapping.
####### Measured speeds and torques.

(1)Determine the applicable speeds and torques for the duty cycles you will run:

(i) Measured maximum test speed for variable-speed engines according to § 1065.610.

(ii) Measured maximum test torque for constant-speed engines according to § 1065.610.

(iii) Measured "A", "B", and "C" speeds for variable-speed engines according to § 1065.610.

(iv) Measured intermediate speed for variable-speed engines according to § 1065.610.

(v) For variable-speed engines with a low-speed governor, measure warm idle speed according to § 1065.510(b) and use this speed for cycle generation in § 1065.512. For engines with no low-speed governor, instead use the manufacturer-declared warm idle speed.
