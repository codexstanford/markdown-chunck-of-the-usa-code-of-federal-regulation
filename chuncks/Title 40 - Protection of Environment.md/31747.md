####### Uncontrolled HAP emissions

means a gas stream containing HAP which has exited the process (or process condenser, if any), but which has not yet been introduced into an air pollution control device to reduce the mass of HAP in the stream. If the process vent is not routed to an air pollution control device, uncontrolled emissions are those HAP emissions released to the atmosphere.
