####### e.g.,

(3) Describe protocols for maintaining signage (inspections at set intervals);

(4) Identify (with points of contact) the municipalities, public drinking water supplies, public parks with water access, Indian Tribe(s), and describe other sensitive area(s) identified in the permittee's long-term CSO control plan, that may be impacted by the permittee's CSO discharges;

(5) Summarize significant comments and recommendations raised by the local public health department under paragraph (d) of this section;

(6) Identify other affected public entities and Indian Tribes whose waters may be impacted by a CSO discharge that were contacted under paragraph (d) of this section and provide a summary of their significant comments and recommendations;

(7) Describe protocols for the initial and supplemental notice to public health departments and other public entities;

(8) Describe protocols for the initial and supplemental notice to the public; this shall include a description of circumstances under which the initial notification of the public may be delayed beyond four hours of the permittee becoming aware of the discharge, which shall only include circumstances where a physical action is needed to limit the public health impacts of a CSO discharge by controlling the CSO discharge (including continuing to implement its existing practice of conducting inspections of CSO discharge points during the discharge), and all available staff are required to complete this action, and, therefore, are not available to initiate the initial notification until this action is complete;

(9) Describe, for each CSO discharge point, how the volume and duration of CSO discharges shall be either measured or estimated for the purposes of complying with paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A), (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(2) and (3) of this section. If the Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee intends to use a model to estimate discharge volumes and durations, the plan must summarize the model and describe how the model was or will be calibrated. CSO permittees that are a municipality or sewer district with a population of 75,000 or more must assess whether re-calibration of their model is necessary, and recalibrate if necessary, at least once every 5 years;

(10) Describe protocols for making the annual notice described in paragraph (b) of this section available to the public and to the Director; and

(11) Describe significant modifications to the plan that were made since it was last updated.
