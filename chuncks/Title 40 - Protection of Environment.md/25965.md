###### § 63.165 Standards: Pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service.

(a) Except during pressure releases, each pressure relief device in gas/vapor service shall be operated with an instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, as measured by the method specified in § 63.180(c) of this subpart.

(b)(1) After each pressure release, the pressure relief device shall be returned to a condition indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background, as soon as practicable, but no later than 5 calendar days after each pressure release, except as provided in § 63.171 of this subpart.

(2) No later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release and being returned to organic HAP service, the pressure relief device shall be monitored to confirm the condition indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background, as measured by the method specified in § 63.180(c) of this subpart.

(c) Any pressure relief device that is routed to a process or fuel gas system or equipped with a closed-vent system capable of capturing and transporting leakage from the pressure relief device to a control device as described in § 63.172 of this subpart is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d)(1) Any pressure relief device that is equipped with a rupture disk upstream of the pressure relief device is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, provided the owner or operator complies with the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) After each pressure release, a rupture disk shall be installed upstream of the pressure relief device as soon as practicable, but no later than 5 calendar days after each pressure release, except as provided in § 63.171 of this subpart.
