####### Fractionators

means plants that produce fractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted from produced natural gas and separate the NGLs individual component products: ethane, propane, butanes and pentane-plus (C5 + ). Plants that only process natural gas but do not fractionate NGLs further into component products are not considered fractionators. Some fractionators do not process production gas, but instead fractionate bulk NGLs received from natural gas processors. Some fractionators both process natural gas and fractionate bulk NGLs received from other plants.
