(1) We designate angular speed,, of an engine's crankshaft in revolutions per minute (r/min), rather than the SI unit of radians per second (rad/s). This is based on the commonplace use of r/min in many engine dynamometer laboratories.

(2) We designate brake-specific emissions in grams per kilowatt-hour (g/(kW &#xB7; hr)), rather than the SI unit of grams per megajoule (g/MJ). In addition, we use the symbol hr to identify hour, rather than the SI convention of using h. This is based on the fact that engines are generally subject to emission standards expressed in g/kW &#xB7; hr. If we specify engine standards in grams per horsepower &#xB7; hour (g/(hp &#xB7; hr)) in the standard-setting part, convert units as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(3) We generally designate temperatures in units of degrees Celsius ( &#xB0;C) unless a calculation requires an absolute temperature. In that case, we designate temperatures in units of Kelvin (K). For conversion purposes throughout this part, 0 &#xB0;C equals 273.15 K. Unless specified otherwise, always use absolute temperature values for multiplying or dividing by temperature.
