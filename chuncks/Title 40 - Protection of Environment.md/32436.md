####### 2

() To demonstrate compliance with the requirements for nonepoxide organic HAP emissions in making or modifying the product in ยง 63.1425(c), the inlet sampling site shall be located after all control techniques to reduce epoxide emissions but before any nonepoxide organic HAP recovery device.

(C) If a process vent stream is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all process vent streams and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.

(ii) To determine compliance with a parts per million by volume total epoxide or TOC limit in ยง 63.1425(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii), the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
