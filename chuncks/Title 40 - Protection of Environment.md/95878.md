####### Cleaning of equipment.

(vi)(A) Test substance delivery systems and test chambers should be cleaned before use. Test chambers should be cleaned during the test as needed to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration, and to prevent clogging of the embryo cup screens and narrow flow passages.

(B) Debris can be removed with a rubber bulb and large pipette or by siphoning with a glass tube attached to a flexible hose. Debris should be run into a bucket light enough to observe that no live fish are accidentally discarded.
