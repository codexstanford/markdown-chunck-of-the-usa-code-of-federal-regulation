###### i.e.,

8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the RSD of the amount removed (effluent concentration-wastewater feed concentration). The RSD values shall be <15 percent. If an RSD value is >15 percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and effluent sets of samples until the RSD values are within specifications.

8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.
