###### The F test.

11.2.2Determine if the estimated variance of the candidate test method is greater than that of the validated method by calculating the F-value using Equation 301-17.

Compare the calculated F value with the one-sided confidence level for F from Table 301-4 of this method. The upper one-sided confidence level of 95 percent for Fis 4.28 when the procedure specified in Table 301-1 of this method for quadruplicate sampling trains is followed. If the calculated F value is greater than the critical F value, the difference in precision is significant, and the data and the candidate test method are unacceptable.

You must analyze the data for analyte spike testing according to this section.
