########### Appendix N to Part 50 - Interpretation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM

(a) This appendix explains the data handling conventions and computations necessary for determining when the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PMare met, specifically the primary and secondary annual and 24-hour PMNAAQS specified in § 50.7, 50.13, and 50.18. PMis defined, in general terms, as particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers. PMmass concentrations are measured in the ambient air by a Federal Reference Method (FRM) based on appendix L of this part, as applicable, and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or by a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or by an Approved Regional Method (ARM) designated in accordance with part 58 of this chapter. Only those FRM, FEM, and ARM measurements that are derived in accordance with part 58 of this chapter (i.e., that are deemed "suitable") shall be used in comparisons with the PMNAAQS. The data handling and computation procedures to be used to construct annual and 24-hour NAAQS metrics from reported PMmass concentrations, and the associated instructions for comparing these calculated metrics to the levels of the PMNAAQS, are specified in sections 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 of this appendix.

(b) Decisions to exclude, retain, or make adjustments to the data affected by exceptional events, including natural events, are made according to the requirements and process deadlines specified in §§ 50.1, 50.14 and 51.930 of this chapter.

(c) The terms used in this appendix are defined as follows:
