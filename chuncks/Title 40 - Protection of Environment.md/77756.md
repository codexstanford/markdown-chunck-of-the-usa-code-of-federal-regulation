####### CO,and carbon-related exhaust emissions calculations for hybrid electric vehicles.

(f)Test hybrid electric vehicles as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in ยง 600.011). For FTP testing, this generally involves emission sampling over four phases (bags) of the UDDS (cold-start, transient, warm-start, transient); however, these four phases may be combined into two phases (phases 1 + 2 and phases 3 + 4). Calculations for these sampling methods follow:
