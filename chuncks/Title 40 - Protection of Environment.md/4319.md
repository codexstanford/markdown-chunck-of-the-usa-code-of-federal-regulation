8.2.12.4-The concentration of pararosaniline hydrochloride (PRA) need be assayed only once after purification. It is also recommended that commercial solutions of pararosaniline be assayed when first purchased. The assay procedure is as follows:()

1. Prepare 1 M acetate-acetic acid buffer stock solution with a pH of 4.79 by dissolving 13.61 g of sodium acetate trihydrate in distilled water in a 100-mL volumetric flask. Add 5.70 mL of glacial acetic acid and dilute to volume with distilled water.

2. Pipet 1 mL of the stock PRA solution obtained from the purification process or from a commercial source into a 100-mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume with distilled water.

3. Transfer a 5-mL aliquot of the diluted PRA solution from 2. into a 50-mL volumetric flask. Add 5mL of 1 M acetate-acetic acid buffer solution from 1. and dilute the mixture to volume with distilled water. Let the mixture stand for 1 hour.

4. Measure the absorbance of the above solution at 540 nm with a spectrophotometer against a distilled water reference. Compute the percentage of nominal concentration of PRA by
