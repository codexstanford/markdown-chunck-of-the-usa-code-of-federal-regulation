(2) A tolerance of 0.05 ppm is established for residues of the insecticide deltamethrin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on all food/feed items (other than those covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops) when deltamethrin is used in food/feed handling establishments or as a wide-area mosquito adulticide. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified is to be determined by measuring only deltamethrin, (1,3)-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid ()--cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester, and its major metabolites,-deltamethrin, ()--cyano--phenoxybenzyl(1,3)-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, and-deltamethrin, ()--cyano--phenoxybenzyl-(1,3)-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, in or on the commodity.
