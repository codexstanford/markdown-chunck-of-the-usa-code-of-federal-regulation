Such wells are Class I wells as specified in ยง 144.6(a)(1), and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements applicable to Class I wells.

Such wells are Class I wells as specified in ยง 144.6(a)(1), and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements applicable to Class I wells.
