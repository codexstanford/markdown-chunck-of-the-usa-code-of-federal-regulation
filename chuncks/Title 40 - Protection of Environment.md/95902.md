####### Range-finding test.

(3)(i) A range-finding test should be conducted to determine:

(A) Which life stage (juvenile or young adult) is to be utilized in the definitive test.

(B) The test solution concentrations for the definitive test.

(ii) The mysids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced concentrations of test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/l, etc.), usually under static conditions.

(iii) This test should be conducted with both newly hatched juvenile (<24 hours old) and young adult (5 to 6 days old) mysids. For each age class (juvenile or young adult), a minimum of 10 mysids should be exposed to each concentration of test substance for up to 96 hours. The exposure period may be shortened if data suitable for the purpose of the range-finding test can be obtained in less time. The age class which is most sensitive to the test substance in the range-finding test shall be utilized in the definitive test. When no apparent difference in sensitivity of the two life stages is found, juveniles shall be utilized in the definitive test. No replicates are required, and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
