###### ยง 1065.145 Gaseous and PM probes, transfer lines, and sampling system components.
####### Gaseous samples.

(1)Use transfer lines with inside surfaces of 300 series stainless steel, PTFE, Viton, or any other material that you demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling. For raw exhaust sampling, use a non-reactive material capable of withstanding raw exhaust temperatures. You may use in-line filters if they do not react with exhaust constituents and if the filter and its housing meet the same temperature requirements as the transfer lines, as follows:

(i) For NOtransfer lines upstream of either an NO-to-NO converter that meets the specifications of ยง 1065.378 or a chiller that meets the specifications of ยง 1065.376, maintain a sample temperature that prevents aqueous condensation.

(ii) For THC transfer lines for testing compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, or four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW, maintain a wall temperature tolerance throughout the entire line of (191 +/-11) &#xB0;C. If you sample from raw exhaust, you may connect an unheated, insulated transfer line directly to a probe. Design the length and insulation of the transfer line to cool the highest expected raw exhaust temperature to no lower than 191 &#xB0;C, as measured at the transfer line's outlet. For dilute sampling, you may use a transition zone between the probe and transfer line of up to 92 cm to allow your wall temperature to transition to (191 +/-11) &#xB0;C.
