###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Operating limit deviations.

(4)If one or more operating limit deviations occurred during the monthly averaging period, compliance with the emission standards in ยง 63.3320(b) is determined by assuming no control of emissions or by estimating the emissions using a control destruction efficiency curve during each 3-hour period that was a deviation. You are in compliance with the emission standards in ยง 63.3320(b) if, including the periods of deviation:

(i) The overall organic HAP control efficiency is 95 percent or greater at an existing affected source and 98 percent or greater at a new affected source; or

(ii) The organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or

(iii) The organic HAP emission rate based on coating material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg coating material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg coating material applied at a new affected source; or

(iv) The organic HAP emitted during the month is less than the calculated allowable organic HAP as determined using paragraph (m) of this section.
