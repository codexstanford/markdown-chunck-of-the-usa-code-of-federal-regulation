This section describes how EPA interprets and will enforce requirements of FIFRA section 17(a)(2). Section 17(a)(2) provides that any person exporting a pesticide other than a pesticide registered for use under FIFRA section 3 or sold under FIFRA section 6(a)(1), shall obtain a statement signed by the foreign purchaser prior to export, acknowledging that the purchaser understands that such pesticide is not registered for use in the United States and cannot be sold in the United States. Section 17(a)(2) requires that a copy of the statement be transmitted to an appropriate official of the government of the importing country.
