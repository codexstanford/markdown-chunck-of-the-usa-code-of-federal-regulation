###### ยง 262.232 Conditions for a generator managing hazardous waste from an episodic event.
####### e.g.,

(B) Tanks must be in good condition and compatible with the hazardous waste accumulated therein. Tanks must have procedures in place to prevent the overflow (be equipped with a means to stop inflow with systems such as a waste feed cutoff system or bypass system to a standby tank when hazardous waste is continuously fed into the tank). Tanks must be inspected at least once each operating day to ensure all applicable discharge control equipment, such as waste feed cutoff systems, bypass systems, and drainage systems are in good working order and to ensure the tank is operated according to its design by reviewing the data gathered from monitoring equipment such as pressure and temperature gauges from the inspection.

(5) The very small quantity generator must comply with the hazardous waste manifest provisions of subpart B of this part when it sends its episodic event hazardous waste off site to a designated facility, as defined in ยง 260.10 of this chapter.

(6) The very small quantity generator has up to sixty (60) calendar days from the start of the episodic event to manifest and send its hazardous waste generated from the episodic event to a designated facility, as defined in ยง 260.10 of this chapter.

(7) Very small quantity generators must maintain the following records for three (3) years from the end date of the episodic event:

(i) Beginning and end dates of the episodic event;

(ii) A description of the episodic event;

(iii) A description of the types and quantities of hazardous wastes generated during the event;

(iv) A description of how the hazardous waste was managed as well as the name of the RCRA-designated facility that received the hazardous waste;

(v) Name(s) of hazardous waste transporters; and

(vi) An approval letter from EPA if the generator petitioned to conduct one additional episodic event per calendar year.
