####### new affected source,

(8) When the HON requirements in §§ 63.132 through 63.149 refer to a "new source," the termas defined in § 63.1420(a)(3), shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(9) When the HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.132 (a) and (b) refer to the "applicable dates specified in § 63.100 of subpart F of this part," the applicable compliance dates specified in § 63.1422 shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart.

(10) Whenever the HON process wastewater provisions in §§ 63.132 through 63.147 refer to a Group 1 wastewater stream or a Group 2 wastewater stream, the definitions of these terms contained in § 63.1423 shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart.

(11) When the HON control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems, in § 63.149(d), refer to "§ 63.100(f) of subpart F," the phrase "§ 63.1420(c)," shall apply for the purposes of this subpart. In addition, where § 63.149(d) states "and the item of equipment is not otherwise exempt from controls by the provisions of subparts A, F, G, or H of this part," the phrase "and the item of equipment is not otherwise exempt from controls by the provisions of subparts A, F, G, H, or PPP of this part," shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(12) When the HON control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems, in § 63.149(e) (1) and (2), refer to "a chemical manufacturing process unit subject to the new source requirements of 40 CFR 63.100(l) (1) or (2)," the phrase "a new affected source as described in § 63.1420(a)(4)," shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(13) When the HON Notification of Compliance Status requirements contained in § 63.152(b) are referred to in the HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.138 or § 63.146, the Notification of Compliance Status requirements contained in § 63.1439(e)(5) shall apply for the purposes of this subpart. In addition, when the HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.138 or § 63.146 require that information be reported according to § 63.152(b) in the HON Notification of Compliance Status, owners or operators of affected sources shall report the specified information in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1439(e)(5), for the purposes of this subpart.

(14) When the HON Periodic Report requirements contained in § 63.152(c) are referred to in the HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.146, the Periodic Report requirements contained in § 63.1439(e)(6) shall apply for the purposes of this subpart. In addition, when § 63.146 requires that information be reported in the HON Periodic Reports required in § 63.152(c), owners or operators of affected sources shall report the specified information in the Periodic Reports required in § 63.1439(e)(6), for the purposes of this subpart.

(15) When the term "range" is used in the HON requirements in §§ 63.132 through 63.149, the term "level" shall be used instead, for the purposes of this subpart. This level shall be determined using the procedures specified in parameter monitoring procedures in § 63.1438.

(16) When the HON process wastewater monitoring and inspection provisions in § 63.143(f) specify that the owner or operator shall establish the range that indicates proper operation of the treatment process or control technique, the owner or operator shall instead comply with the requirements § 63.1438 (c) or (d) for establishing parameter level maximums/minimums, for the purposes of this subpart.

(17) When the HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.146(b) (7) and (8) require that "the information on parameter ranges specified in § 63.152(b)(2)" be reported in the HON Notification of Compliance Status, owners and operators of affected sources are instead required to report the information on parameter levels in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in § 63.1439(e)(5)(ii), for the purposes of this subpart.

(18) For the purposes of this subpart, the owner or operator is not required to comply with the HON process wastewater emission reduction provisions in § 63.138(g).

(19) When the provisions of HON process wastewater provisions in § 63.139(c)(1)(ii), § 63.145(d)(4), or § 63.145(i)(2) specify that Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A may be used for the purposes of this subpart. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall comply with paragraphs (a)(19) (i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.

(ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.

(20) The owner or operator of a facility which receives a Group 1 wastewater stream, or a residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream, for treatment pursuant to the HON provisions in § 63.132(g) is subject to the requirements of § 63.132(g), with the differences identified in this section, and is not subject to the NESHAP from off-site waste and recovery operations in 40 CFR part 63, subpart DD, with respect to the received material.
