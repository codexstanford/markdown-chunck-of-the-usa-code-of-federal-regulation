(vii)(A) At the end of the test, surviving animals must be weighed and sacrificed.

(B) A gross necropsy must be performed on all animals under test. All gross pathology changes should be recorded.

(C) If necropsy cannot be performed immediately after a dead animal is discovered, the animal should be refrigerated (not frozen) at temperatures low enough to minimize autolysis. Necropsies should be performed as soon as practicable, normally within a day or two.
