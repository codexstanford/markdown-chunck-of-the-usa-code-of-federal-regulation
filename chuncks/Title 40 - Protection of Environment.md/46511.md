####### Individual records.

(2)(i) A brief history of each motor vehicle (or motor vehicle engine) used for certification under this subpart including:

(A) In the case where a current production engine is modified for use in a certification vehicle (or as a certification engine), a description of the process by which the engine was selected and of the modifications made. In the case where the engine for a certification vehicle (or certification engine) is not derived from a current production engine, a general description of the buildup of the engine (e.g., experimental heads were cast and machined according to supplied drawings, etc.). In both cases above, a description of the origin and selection process for carburetor, distributor, fuel system components, fuel injection components, emission control system components, smoke exhaust emission control system components, and exhaust aftertreatment devices as applicable, shall be included. The required descriptions shall specify the steps taken to assure that the certification vehicle (or certification engine) with respect to its engine, drivetrain, fuel system, emission control system components, exhaust aftertreatment devices, smoke exhaust emission control system components, vehicle weight or any other devices or components, as applicable, that can reasonably be expected to influence exhaust or evaporative emissions, as applicable, will be representative of production vehicles (or engines) and that either all components and/or vehicles (or engine) construction processed, component inspection and selection techniques, and assembly techniques employed in constructing such vehicles (or engines) are reasonably likely to be implemented for production vehicles (or engines) or that they are as closely analogous as practicable to planned construction and assembly processed.

(B) A complete record of all emission tests performed (except tests performed by EPA directly), including test results, the date and purpose of each test, and the number of miles accumulated on the vehicle (or the number of hours accumulated on the engine).

(C) The date of each mileage (or service) accumulation run, listing the mileage (or number of operating hours) accumulated.

(D) [Reserved]

(E) A record and description of all maintenance and other servicing performed, giving the date of the maintenance or service and the reason for it.

(F) A record and description of each test performed to diagnose engine or emission control system performance, giving the date and time of the test and the reason for it.

(G) [Reserved]

(H) A brief description of any significant events affecting the vehicle (or engine) during any time in the period covered by the history not described by an entry under one of the previous headings including such extraordinary events as vehicle accidents (or accidents involving the engine) or dynamometer runaway.

(ii) Each such history shall be started on the date that the first of any of the selection or buildup activities in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section occurred with respect to the certification vehicle (or engine) changes or additional work is done on it, and shall be kept in a designated location.
