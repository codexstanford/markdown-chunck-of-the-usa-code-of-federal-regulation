() The integrity of the various cell stages of spermatogenesis shall be determined, with particular attention directed toward achieving optimal quality in the fixation and embedding. Preparations of testicular and associated reproductive organ samples for histology should follow the recommendations of Lamb and Chapin (1985) under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or an equivalent procedure. Histopathology of the testes shall be conducted on all P and Fadult males at the time of sacrifice, and histological analyses shall include evaluations of the spermatogenic cycle, i.e., the presence and integrity of the 14 cell stages. These evaluations should follow the guidance provided by Clermont and Percy (1957) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Information shall also be provided regarding the nature and level of lesions observed in control animals for comparative purposes.
