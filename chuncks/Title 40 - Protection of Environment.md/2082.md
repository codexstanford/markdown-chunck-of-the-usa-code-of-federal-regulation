####### Reserve for Advances of Allowance.

(e)Each State shall reserve a reasonable portion of its annual allotment not to exceed 10 percent for advances of allowance under ยง 35.2025. The Regional Administrator may waive this reserve requirement where a State can demonstrate that such a reserve is not necessary because no new facilities planning or design work requiring an advance and resulting in Step 3 grant awards is expected to begin during the period of availability of the annual allotment.
