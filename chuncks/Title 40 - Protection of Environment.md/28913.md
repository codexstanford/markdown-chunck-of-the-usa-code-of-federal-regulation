###### § 63.1005 Leak repair.
####### Delay of repair.

(c)Delay of repair can be used as specified in any of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the facts that explain any delay of repairs and, where appropriate, why the repair was technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown.

(1) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a process unit or affected facility shutdown within 15 days after a leak is detected. Repair of this equipment shall occur as soon as practical, but not later than by the end of the next process unit or affected facility shutdown, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

(2) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in regulated material service.

(3) Delay of repair for valves, connectors, and agitators is also allowed if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) are met.

(i) The owner or operator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and

(ii) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed, or recovered in a control or recovery device, or routed to a fuel gas system or process complying with § 63.1015 or § 63.1002(b) of this part.

(4) Delay of repair for pumps is allowed if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) are met.

(i) Repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a new system that the owner or operator has determined will provide better performance or one of the specifications of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section are met.

(A) A dual mechanical seal system that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(1) will be installed,

(B) A pump that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(2) will be installed; or

(C) A system that routes emissions to a process or a fuel gas system or a closed vent system and control device that meets the requirements of § 63.1007(e)(3) will be installed.

(ii) Repair is to be completed as soon as practical, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.

(5) Delay of repair beyond a process unit or affected facility shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit or affected facility shutdown, and valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit or affected facility shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit or affected facility shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit or affected facility shutdown.
