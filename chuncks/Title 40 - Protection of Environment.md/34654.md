######## Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60).

(2)For coatings, you may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may use the alternative method contained in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, rather than Method 24. You may use the volatile fraction that is emitted, as measured by the alternative method in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, as a substitute for the mass fraction of organic HAP.
