######### Calculation of allocation.

(b)For each control period for which a CAIR SOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SOallowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with the following procedures, if provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with § 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this chapter and approved by the Administrator:

(1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR SOallowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR SOopt-in unit's baseline heat input determined under § 97.284(c); or

(ii) The CAIR SOopt-in unit's heat input, as determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, for the immediately prior control period, except when the allocation is being calculated for the control period in which the CAIR SOopt-in unit enters the CAIR SOTrading Program under § 97.284(g).

(2) The SOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR SOallowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR SOopt-in unit's baseline SOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.284(d) and multiplied by 70 percent; or

(ii) The most stringent State or Federal SOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR SOopt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR SOallowances are to be allocated.

(3) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SOallowances to the CAIR SOopt-in unit with a tonnage equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the heat input under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, multiplied by the SOemission rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and divided by 2,000 lb/ton.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section and if the CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit (based on a demonstration of the intent to repower stated under § 97.283(a)(5)) providing for, allocation to a CAIR SOopt-in unit of CAIR SOallowances under this paragraph (subject to the conditions in §§ 97.284(h) and 97.286(g)), the permitting authority will allocate to the CAIR SOopt-in unit as follows, if provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with § 51.124(r)(1), (2), or (3) of this chapter and approved by the Administrator:

(1) For each control period in 2010 through 2014 for which the CAIR SOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SOallowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR SOallowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The SOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR SOallowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(A) The CAIR SOopt-in unit's baseline SOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.284(d); or

(B) The most stringent State or Federal SOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR SOopt-in unit at any time during the control period in which the CAIR SOopt-in unit enters the CAIR SOTrading Program under § 97.284(g).

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SOallowances to the CAIR SOopt-in unit with a tonnage equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the heat input under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, multiplied by the SOemission rate under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and divided by 2,000 lb/ton.

(2) For each control period in 2015 and thereafter for which the CAIR SOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR SOallowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR SOallowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The SOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR SOallowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(A) The CAIR SOopt-in unit's baseline SOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.284(d) multiplied by 10 percent; or

(B) The most stringent State or Federal SOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR SOopt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR SOallowances are to be allocated.

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR SOallowances to the CAIR SOopt-in unit with a tonnage equivalent equal to, or less than by the smallest possible amount, the heat input under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, multiplied by the SOemission rate under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and divided by 2,000 lb/ton.
