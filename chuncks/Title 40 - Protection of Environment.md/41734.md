####### Administrative permit amendments.

(c)(1) An "administrative permit amendment" is a permit revision that:

(i) Corrects typographical errors;

(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;

(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;

(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of an early reductions source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority; or

(v) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be ministerial in nature and, therefore, similar to those in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
