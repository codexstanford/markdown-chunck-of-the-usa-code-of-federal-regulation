Using all the available background data (nreadings), calculate the background mean (X) and background variance (s2). For the single monitoring well under investigation (nreading), calculate the monitoring mean (X) and monitoring variance (s2).

For any set of data (X, X, . . ., X) the mean is calculated by:

The t-test uses these data summary measures to calculate a t-statistic (t*) and a comparison t-statistic (t). The t* value is compared to the tvalue and a conclusion reached as to whether there has been a statistically significant change in any indicator parameter.

The t-statistic for all parameters except pH and similar monitoring parameters is:

The t-statistic (t), against which t* will be compared, necessitates finding tand tfrom standard (one-tailed) tables where,

Finally, the special weightings Wand Ware defined as:

The t-statistic (t*) is now compared with the comparison t-statistic (t) using the following decision-rule:

The t-statistic for testing pH and similar monitoring parameters is constructed in the same manner as previously described except the negative sign (if any) is discarded and the caveat concerning the negative value is ignored. The standard (two-tailed) tables are used in the construction tfor pH and similar monitoring parameters.
