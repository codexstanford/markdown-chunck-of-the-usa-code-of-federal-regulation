(ii) Units employing modifications to boiler operating parameters (e.g., burners out of service or fuel switching) without low NOburners or other emission reduction equipment for reducing NOemissions;

(iii) Units with wall-fired boilers employing only overfire air and units with tangentially fired boilers employing only separated overfire air; or

(iv) Units beginning installation of a new NOemission control system after August 11, 1995.

(3) The report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator by:

(i) 120 days after completion of the low NOburner technology retrofit project; or
