######## Glycol dehydration unit

means a device in which a liquid glycol (including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a natural gas stream and absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption column (absorber). The glycol contacts and absorbs water vapor and other gas stream constituents from the natural gas and becomes "rich" glycol. This glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit reboiler. The "lean" glycol is then recycled.
