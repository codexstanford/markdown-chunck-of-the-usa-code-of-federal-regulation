####### Carbon adsorbers with vacuum regeneration.

(B)The owner or operator shall establish as operating parameters the baseline regeneration time for the vacuum stage of carbon bed regeneration using the procedures described in § 63.565(h) and shall establish the baseline vacuum pressure (negative gauge pressure) using the procedures described in § 63.565(i). Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the facility shall be operated with block average regeneration time of the vacuum stage of carbon bed regeneration as determined in § 63.564(g)(2) no more than 20 percent below the baseline regeneration time, and the facility shall be operated with the block average vacuum pressure (negative gauge pressure) as determined in § 63.564(g)(2) no more than 20 percent above the baseline vacuum pressure.
