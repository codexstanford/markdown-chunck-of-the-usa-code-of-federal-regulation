####### Contaminants

means all pollutants listed in Clean Air Act sections 112(b) or 129(a)(4), with the following three modifications:

(1) The definition includes the elements chlorine, fluorine, nitrogen, and sulfur in cases where non-hazardous secondary materials are burned as a fuel and combustion will result in the formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), nitrogen oxides (NO), or sulfur dioxide (SO). Chlorine, fluorine, nitrogen, and sulfur are not included in the definition in cases where non-hazardous secondary materials are used as an ingredient and not as a fuel.

(2) The definition does not include the following pollutants that are either unlikely to be found in non-hazardous secondary materials and products made from such materials or are adequately measured by other parts of this definition: hydrogen chloride (HCl), chlorine gas (Cl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), nitrogen oxides (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO), fine mineral fibers, particulate matter, coke oven emissions, opacity, diazomethane, white phosphorus, and titanium tetrachloride.

(3) The definition does not include m-cresol, o-cresol, p-cresol, m-xylene, o-xylene, and p-xylene as individual contaminants distinct from the grouped pollutants total cresols and total xylenes.
