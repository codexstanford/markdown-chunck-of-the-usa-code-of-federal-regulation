####### Useful life

means the period during which a vehicle is required to comply with all applicable emission standards, specified as a given number of hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. It is the period during which an engine is required to comply with all applicable emission standards. See §§ 1045.103(e), 1045.105(e), and 1045.112. If an engine has no hour meter, the specified number of hours does not limit the period during which an in-use engine is required to comply with emission standards unless the degree of service accumulation can be verified separately.
