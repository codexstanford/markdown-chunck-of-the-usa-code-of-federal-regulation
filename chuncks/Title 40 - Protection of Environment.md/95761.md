(ii)The number of immobilized adults, total offspring per adult, and immobilized offspring per adult shall be counted during each test. Appropriate statistical analyses should provide a goodness-of-fit determination for the adult immobilization concentration-response curves calculated on day 21. A 21-day ECbased on adult immobilization and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals shall also be calculated. Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., analysis of variance, mean separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical effects on chronic test criteria (cumulative number of immobilized adults, cumulative number of offspring per adult and cumulative number of immobilized offspring per adult) on day 21. An MATC shall be calculated using these chronic test criteria.
