(iii) Determine the mass fraction of volatile organic matter for each coating, printing, cleaning, and thinning material applied in the web coating/printing operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg volatile organic matter per kg coating, printing, cleaning, and thinning material. You may determine the volatile organic matter mass fraction using Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60, ASTM D2369-10 (R2015), "Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings" (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), or an EPA approved alternative method. Alternatively, you may use information provided by the manufacturer or supplier of the coating or printing material. In the event of any inconsistency between information provided by the manufacturer or supplier and the results of Method 24, ASTM D2369-10 (R2015), or an approved alternative method, the test method results will govern.

(iv) Measure the mass of each coating, printing, thinning, and cleaning material applied in the web coating/printing operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg.

(v) For the compliance period, calculate the solvent recovery system's volatile organic matter collection and recovery efficiency using Equation 2 of this section:

(vi) Calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reductions for the web coating/printing operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period using Equation 3 of this section and according to paragraphs (e)(5)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section:

(A) Calculate the total mass of organic HAP in the coating and printing materials applied in the web coating/printing operation(s) controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg, using Equation 3A of this section:

(B) Calculate the total mass of organic HAP in the thinning and cleaning materials applied in the web coating/printing operation(s) controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg, using Equation 3B of this section:
