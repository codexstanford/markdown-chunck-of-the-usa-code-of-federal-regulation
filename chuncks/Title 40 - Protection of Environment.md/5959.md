####### First-chance and second-chance high-speed modes.

(2)This mode includes both the first-chance and second-chance high-speed modes, and follows immediately upon termination of the first-chance idle mode.

(i) The mode timer shall reset (mt = 0) when the vehicle engine speed is between 2200 and 2800 rpm. If engine speed falls below 2200 rpm or exceeds 2800 rpm for more than two seconds in one excursion, or more than six seconds over all excursions within 30 seconds of the final measured value used in the pass/fail determination, the measured value shall be invalidated and the mode continued. If any excursion lasts for more than ten seconds, the mode timer shall reset to zero (mt = 0) and timing resumed. The minimum high-speed mode length shall be determined as described under paragraphs (II)(c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this appendix. The maximum high-speed mode length shall be 180 seconds elapsed time (mt = 180).
