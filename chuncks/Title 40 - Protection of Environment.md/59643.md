(2) When water stored in a tank is to be used for mixing pesticides, it shall not be used for decontamination or eyeflushing, unless the tank is equipped with properly functioning valves or other mechanisms that prevent movement of pesticides into the tank.

(3) The agricultural employer shall provide soap and single-use towels in quantities sufficient to meet worker's needs.
