####### Recovery device monitoring records during TRE index value determination.

(3)For process vents that require control of emissions under a referencing subpart, owners or operators using a recovery device to maintain a TRE above a level specified in the referencing subpart shall maintain the continuous records specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable, and submit reports as specified in ยง 63.999(a)(2)(iii)(C).

(i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the saturated scrubbing fluid and specific gravity of the scrubbing fluid is greater than or equal to 0.02 specific gravity units, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter that is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation if approved by the Administrator) and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or

(ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or

(iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total regeneration stream mass flow during each carbon-bed regeneration cycle during the period of the TRE index value determination, and temperature of the carbon-bed after each regeneration during the period of the TRE index value determination (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle or cycles); or

(iv) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the concentration level or reading indicated by an organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

(v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream as specified in a referencing subpart.
