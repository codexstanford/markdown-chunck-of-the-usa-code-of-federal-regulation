####### i.e.

(e) In the case of lead and total cyanide, the discharge quantity (mass) shall be determined by multiplying the concentrations listed in the applicable tables in this subpart times the flow from non-complexed lead-bearing waste streams for lead and times the flow from non-complexed cyanide-bearing waste streams for total cyanide. Discharges of cyanide in cyanide-bearing waste streams are not subject to the cyanide limitation and standards of this subpart if the permit writer or control authority determines that the cyanide limitations and standards are not achievable due to elevated levels of non-amenable cyanide (, cyanide that is not oxidized by chlorine treatment) that result from the unavoidable complexing of cyanide at the process source of the cyanide-bearing waste stream and establishes an alternative total cyanide or amenable cyanide limitation that reflects the best available technology economically achievable. The determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information, including measurements of both total and amenable cyanide in the waste stream. An analysis of the extent of complexing in the waste stream, based on the foregoing information, and its impact on cyanide treatability shall be set forth in writing and, for direct dischargers, be contained in the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.8.
