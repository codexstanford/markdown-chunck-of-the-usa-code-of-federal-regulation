####### ยง 53.64 Test procedure: Static fractionator test.
######## Wash-off method.

(1)Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass deposited on the candidate sampler's after filter versus the aerosol mass deposited in the fractionator. The material deposited in the fractionator is recovered by washing its internal surfaces. For these wash-off tests, a fluorometer must be used to quantitate the aerosol concentration. Note that if this technique is chosen, the candidate must be reloaded with coarse aerosol prior to each test point when reevaluating the curve as specified in the loading test.
