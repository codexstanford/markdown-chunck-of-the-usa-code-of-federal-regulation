###### Preparation of test concentrations.,Menidia.

3.53.5.1Place test jars (approximately 22.5 cm in height, 15 cm in diameter, 11 cm in diameter at the mouth) containing 2 liters of synthetic seawater on a reciprocal shaker. The shaker platform should be adapted to hold firmly six of the toxicity test jars. Add the desired amount of the petroleum product (if applicable) under test directly to each test jar. Dispense the appropriate amount of toxicant (if applicable) into the jars with a pipette. Tightly cap the test jars and shake for 5 minutes at approximately 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute in a reciprocal shaker or at approximately 150 to 160 rpm on orbital shakers. At the completion of shaking, remove the jars from the shaker and dispense 1 liter of the mixture to each of the 1-liter glass beakers. Randomly place beakers in a constant-temperature water bath or room, take water quality measurements, add fish, and initiate aeration.
