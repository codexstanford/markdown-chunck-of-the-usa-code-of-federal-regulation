######## Spray-applied painting

means application of paints using a hand-held device that creates an atomized mist of paint and deposits the paint on a substrate. For the purposes of this subpart, spray-applied painting does not include the following materials or activities:

(1) Paints applied from a hand-held device with a paint cup capacity that is less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cubic centimeters).

(2) Surface coating application using powder coating, hand-held, non-refillable aerosol containers, or non-atomizing application technology, including, but not limited to, paint brushes, rollers, hand wiping, flow coating, dip coating, electrodeposition coating, web coating, coil coating, touch-up markers, or marking pens.

(3) Painting operations that normally require the use of an airbrush or an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces; the application of paints that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns, and the application of paints that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.).

(4) Thermal spray operations (also known as metallizing, flame spray, plasma arc spray, and electric arc spray, among other names) in which solid metallic or non-metallic material is heated to a molten or semi-molten state and propelled to the work piece or substrate by compressed air or other gas, where a bond is produced upon impact.
