######## Diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine

means:

(1)(i) Each stationary combustion turbine which is equipped only to fire gas using diffusion flame technology,

(ii) Each stationary combustion turbine which is equipped both to fire gas using diffusion flame technology and to fire oil, during any period when it is firing gas, and

(iii) Each stationary combustion turbine which is equipped both to fire gas using diffusion flame technology and to fire oil, and is located at a major source where all new, reconstructed, and existing stationary combustion turbines fire oil no more than an aggregate total of 1000 hours during the calendar year.

(2) Diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbines do not include:

(i) Any emergency stationary combustion turbine,

(ii) Any stationary combustion turbine located on the North Slope of Alaska, or

(iii) Any stationary combustion turbine burning landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, or any stationary combustion turbine where gasified MSW is used to generate 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis.
