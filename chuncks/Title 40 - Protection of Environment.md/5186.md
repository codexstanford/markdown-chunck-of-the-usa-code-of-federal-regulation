####### ii,1,i

() The applicant can establish that the proposed new emissions unit is a replacement for the shutdown or curtailed emissions unit, and the emissions reductions achieved by the shutdown or curtailment met the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C)()() of this section.

(D) No emissions credit may be allowed for replacing one hydrocarbon compound with another of lesser reactivity, except that emissions credit may be allowed for the replacement with those compounds listed as having negligible photochemical reactivity in ยง 51.100(s).

(E) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be federally enforceable;

(F) Procedures relating to the permissible location of offsetting emissions shall be followed which are at least as stringent as those set out in 40 CFR part 51 appendix S section IV.D.

(G) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the reviewing authority has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 51 subpart I or the State has not relied on it in demonstration attainment or reasonable further progress.

(H) [Reserved]

(I) [Reserved]

(J) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tons per year, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with section 173 of the Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (a)(1)(xi) of this section) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(xii) of this section) for each emissions unit.

(4) Each plan may provide that the provisions of this paragraph do not apply to a source or modification that would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following categories:

(i) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers);

(ii) Kraft pulp mills;

(iii) Portland cement plants;

(iv) Primary zinc smelters;

(v) Iron and steel mills;

(vi) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants;

(vii) Primary copper smelters;

(viii) Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 50 tons of refuse per day;

(ix) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or citric acid plants;

(x) Petroleum refineries;

(xi) Lime plants;

(xii) Phosphate rock processing plants;

(xiii) Coke oven batteries;

(xiv) Sulfur recovery plants;

(xv) Carbon black plants (furnace process);

(xvi) Primary lead smelters;

(xvii) Fuel conversion plants;

(xviii) Sintering plants;

(xix) Secondary metal production plants;

(xx) Chemical process plants-The term chemical processing plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermentation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140;

(xxi) Fossil-fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input;

(xxii) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels;

(xxiii) Taconite ore processing plants;

(xxiv) Glass fiber processing plants;

(xxv) Charcoal production plants;

(xxvi) Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input;

(xxvii) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Act.

(5) Each plan shall include enforceable procedures to provide that:

(i) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provision of the plan and any other requirements under local, State or Federal law.

(ii) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforcement limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of regulations approved pursuant to this section shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification;
