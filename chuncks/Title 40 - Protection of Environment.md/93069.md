#### PART 723 - PREMANUFACTURE NOTIFICATION EXEMPTIONS
##### Subpart B - Specific Exemptions
###### ยง 723.50 Chemical substances manufactured in quantities of 10,000 kilograms or less per year, and chemical substances with low environmental releases and human exposures.
####### Multiple exemption holders.

(f)(1) A manufacturer who intends to manufacture a substance for which an exemption under this section was previously approved may apply for an exemption under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section; however, EPA will not approve any subsequent exemption application under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless it can determine that the potential human exposure to, and environmental release of, the new chemical substance at the higher aggregate production volume will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.

(2)(i) If EPA proposes to deny an exemption application for a substance for which another manufacturer currently holds an exemption, and that proposed denial is based exclusively on the cumulative human exposure or environmental release of the substance which precludes the EPA from determining that the subsequent applicant's activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment, the EPA will notify the first exemption holder that it must, within 21 days of its receipt of EPA's notice, either:

(A) Provide a new certification that it has commenced, or that it will commence, manufacture of the new chemical substance under this section within 1 year of the expiration of its exemption review period; or

(B) Withdraw its exemption for the new chemical substance.

(ii) If the first exemption holder does not respond to the EPA's notice under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section within the prescribed time period, EPA shall issue a notice of ineligibility to the first exemption holder under the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
