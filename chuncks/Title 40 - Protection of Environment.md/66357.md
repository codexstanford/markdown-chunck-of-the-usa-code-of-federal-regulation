# Title 40 - Protection of Environment
## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter I - Solid Wastes
#### PART 262 - STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
##### Subpart K - Alternative Requirements for Hazardous Waste Determination and Accumulation of Unwanted Material for Laboratories Owned by Eligible Academic Entities
###### ยง 262.200 Definitions for this subpart.
####### Unwanted material

means any chemical, mixtures of chemicals, products of experiments or other material from a laboratory that is no longer needed, wanted or usable in the laboratory and that is destined for hazardous waste determination by a trained professional. Unwanted materials include reactive acutely hazardous unwanted materials and materials that may eventually be determined not to be solid waste pursuant to ยง 261.2, or a hazardous waste pursuant to ยง 261.3. If an eligible academic entity elects to use another equally effective term in lieu of "unwanted material," as allowed by ยง 262.206(a)(1)(i), the equally effective term has the same meaning and is subject to the same requirements as "unwanted material" under this subpart.
