(2)(i) For the HPLC method describe and/or report:

(A) The method used to determine the sample-loop volume and the average and standard deviation of that volume.

(B) The average and standard deviation of the RF.

(C) Any changes made or problems encountered in the test procedure.

(ii) For the GC, or any other analytical, method report:

(A) The column and GC operating conditions of temperature and flow rate, or the operating conditions of any other analytical method used.

(B) The average and standard deviation of the average area per microliter obtained for each of the standard solutions.

(C) The form of the regression equation obtained in the calibration procedure.

(D) The extracting solvent used, and its extraction efficiency.

(E) The average and standard deviation of solute concentration in each collection vessel.

(F) Any changes made or problems encountered in the test procedure.

(G) If applicable, a complete description of the analytical method which was used instead of the GC method.
