####### § 63.4362 How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?

You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by §§ 63.4340 and 63.4350. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3) and each test run must last at least 1 hour.

(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

(1) Use Method 1 or 1A in appendix A-1 of part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.

(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F in appendix A-1, or Method 2G in appendix A-2, of part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
