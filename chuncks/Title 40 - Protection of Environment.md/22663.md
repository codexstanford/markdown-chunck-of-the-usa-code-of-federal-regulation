###### e.g.,

(i) Your source generates 24 consecutive hourly average PM CEMS responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response (mA reading) used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, or

(ii) The cumulative hourly average PM CEMS responses generated by your source are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, for more than 5 percent of your PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period.

(2) If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the events specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this section occurs while your source is operating under normal conditions.
