####### Corrosion control steps completion for small and medium-size water systems without corrosion control treatment.

(c)Any small or medium-sized system without corrosion control treatment required to complete the corrosion control steps in paragraph (e) of this section due to its exceedance of the lead or copper action level that does not exceed either the lead or copper action levels during each of two consecutive 6-month tap sample monitoring periods pursuant to ยง 141.86 prior to the start of Step 3 in paragraph (e)(3) of this section or Step 5 in paragraph (e)(5) of this section may cease completing the steps and is not required to complete Step 3 or Step 5, respectively, except that medium-sized systems with lead service lines and small systems with lead service lines that choose the corrosion control option pursuant to ยง 141.93 must complete a corrosion control treatment study under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. Any system that initiates Step 5 must complete all remaining steps in paragraphs (e)(6) through (8) of this section and is not permitted to cease the steps. Any system that ceases the steps either prior to Step 3 or Step 5 and thereafter exceeds either the lead or copper action level shall not be permitted to cease the steps a second time and shall complete the applicable treatment steps beginning with the first treatment step which was not previously completed in its entirety. The State may require a water system to repeat treatment steps previously completed by the water system when the State determines that this is necessary to implement the treatment requirements of this section. The State must notify the system in writing of such a determination and explain the basis for its decision.
