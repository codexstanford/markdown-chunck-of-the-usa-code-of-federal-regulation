####### Waste stabilization process

means any physical or chemical process used to either reduce the mobility of hazardous constituents in a waste or eliminate free liquids as determined by Test Method 9095-Paint Filter Liquids Test in "Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods," EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an alternative, an owner or operator may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 approved by the EPA.) A waste stabilization process includes mixing the waste with binders or other materials and curing the resulting waste and binder mixture. Other synonymous terms used to refer to this process are "waste fixation" or "waste solidification." A waste stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials to the surface of a waste, without mixing, agitation, or subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.
