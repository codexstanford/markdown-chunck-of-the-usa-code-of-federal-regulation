####### Certification and Quality Assurance Test Records.

7.1.9For any Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems used to provide data under this subpart, record the following certification and quality-assurance information:

7.1.9.1 The reference values, monitor responses, and calculated calibration error (CE) values, and a flag to indicate whether the test was done using elemental or oxidized Hg, for all required 7-day calibration error tests and daily calibration error tests of the Hg CEMS;

7.1.9.2 The reference values, monitor responses, and calculated linearity error (LE) or system integrity error (SIE) values for all linearity checks of the Hg CEMS, and for all single-level and 3-level system integrity checks of the Hg CEMS;

7.1.9.3 The CEMS and reference method readings for each test run and the calculated relative accuracy results for all RATAs of the Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring systems;

7.1.9.4 The stable stack gas and calibration gas readings and the calculated results for the upscale and downscale stages of all required cycle time tests of the Hg CEMS or, for a batch sampling Hg CEMS, the interval between measured Hg concentration readings;

7.1.9.5 Supporting information for all required RATAs of the Hg monitoring systems, including records of the test dates, the raw reference method and monitoring system data, the results of sample analyses to substantiate the reported test results, and records of sampling equipment calibrations;

7.1.9.6 For sorbent trap monitoring systems, also keep records of the results of all analyses of the sorbent traps used for routine daily operation of the system, and information documenting the results of all leak checks and the other applicable quality control procedures described in Table 12B-1 of Performance Specification (PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.

7.1.9.7 For stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and (if applicable) moisture monitoring systems, you must keep records of all certification, recertification, diagnostic, and on-going quality-assurance tests of these systems, as specified in ยง 75.59 of this chapter.
