####### Knowledge of the waste.

(2)The owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow-weighted annual average benzene concentration of each waste stream. Examples of information that could constitute knowledge include material balances, records of chemicals purchases, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current waste stream conditions. If test data are used, then the owner or operator shall provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability were accounted for in the determination of the flow-weighted annual average benzene concentration for the waste stream. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on determinations of the flow-weighted annual average benzene concentration based on knowledge of the waste, the procedures under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.

(3) Measurements of the benzene concentration in the waste stream in accordance with the following procedures:

(i) Collect a minimum of three representative samples from each waste stream. Where feasible, samples shall be taken from an enclosed pipe prior to the waste being exposed to the atmosphere.

(ii) For waste in enclosed pipes, the following procedures shall be used:

(A) Samples shall be collected prior to the waste being exposed to the atmosphere in order to minimize the loss of benzene prior to sampling.

(B) A static mixer shall be installed in the process line or in a by-pass line unless the owner or operator demonstrates that installation of a static mixer in the line is not necessary to accurately determine the benzene concentration of the waste stream.

(C) The sampling tap shall be located within two pipe diameters of the static mixer outlet.

(D) Prior to the initiation of sampling, sample lines and cooling coil shall be purged with at least four volumes of waste.

(E) After purging, the sample flow shall be directed to a sample container and the tip of the sampling tube shall be kept below the surface of the waste during sampling to minimize contact with the atmosphere.

(H) The sample containers shall immediately be cooled and maintained at a temperature below 10 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) for transfer to the laboratory.
