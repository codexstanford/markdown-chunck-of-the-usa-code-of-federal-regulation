####### ยง 63.1511 Performance test/compliance demonstration general requirements.
######## e.g.

(iii) In order to distribute the sampling time most evenly over all the traverse points, do not perform all runs using the same sampling point order (, if there are four ports and sampling for run 1 began in port 1, then sampling for run 2 could begin in port 4 and continue in reverse order.)

(4) Where multiple affected sources or emission units are exhausted through a common stack, pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted over a period of time during which all affected sources or emission units complete at least 1 entire process operating cycle or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter.

(5) Initial compliance with an applicable emission limit or standard is demonstrated if the average of three runs conducted during the performance test is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit or standard.

(6) Apply paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section for each pollutant separately if a different production rate, charge material or, if applicable, reactive fluxing rate would apply and thereby result in a higher expected emissions rate for that pollutant.

(7) The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction.
