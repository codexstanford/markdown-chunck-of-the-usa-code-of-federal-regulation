###### 13.5 Confirmation Column.

If target compounds are not sufficiently resolved from other target compounds or interferences in the sample to meet the requirements for target compounds in Sections 13.2, 13.3, and/or 13.4 of this method, analyze sample (or another aliquot of the sample) using an alternative column that provides elution order to uniquely quantify the target compounds subject to interference on the first GC column. When using a confirmation column, document the required resolution.

13.6.1 MDL. The MDLs are determined following the procedures in Section 9.3.7 of this method. MDLs are confirmed by preparing and analyzing a spiked sample (spiked at 1 to 5 times the determined MDL, see Section 9.3.8), then confirm that the target compounds meet the qualitative identification criteria in Section 11.4.3.4 of this method. If the MDL confirmation criteria are not met, the MDL determination is repeated with a higher spike concentration until criteria are met.

13.6.2 EDL. If the sample specific EDLs are less than 50% of the emission standard, the EDLs are acceptable.
