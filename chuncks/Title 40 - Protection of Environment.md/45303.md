####### Performance Rating of Refrigerant Recovery Equipment and Recovery/Recycling Equipment,Standard for Safety: Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment,Requirements for Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment Intended for Use with a Flammable Refrigerant.

This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute Standard 740-2016,, and Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1963-2011 (Fourth Edition),, including Supplement SB (added October 11, 2013),

1.1 The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of testing for rating and evaluating the performance and safety of refrigerant recovery and/or recycling equipment and general equipment requirements (herein referred to as "equipment") for contaminant or purity levels, capacity, speed and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere of designated refrigerants, as well as safety for use with flammable refrigerants.

2.1 This standard applies to equipment for recovering and/or recycling flammable single refrigerants, azeotropes, zeotropic blends, and their normal contaminants from refrigerant systems. This standard defines the test apparatus, test gas mixtures, sampling procedures, analytical techniques, and equipment construction that will be used to determine the performance and safety of refrigerant recovery and/or recycling equipment (hereinafter, "equipment").

3.1 All terms in this appendix will follow the definitions in ยง 82.152 and Appendix B3 to Subpart F of Part 82 unless otherwise defined in this appendix.

3.2 All definitions used in UL 1963, including the definitions in Supplement SB, as applicable, are incorporated by reference, see ยง 82.168.
