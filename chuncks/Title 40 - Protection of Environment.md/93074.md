##### Subpart B - Specific Exemptions
###### ยง 723.50 Chemical substances manufactured in quantities of 10,000 kilograms or less per year, and chemical substances with low environmental releases and human exposures.
####### Changes in manufacturing site, use, human exposure and environmental release controls, and certain manufacturing volumes.

(j)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(6) of this section, chemical substances manufactured under this section must be manufactured at the site or sites described, for the uses described, and under the human exposure and environmental release controls described in the exemption notice under paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) Where the manufacturer lists a specific physical form in which the new chemical substance will be manufactured, processed, and/or used, the manufacturer must continue manufacturing, processing, and/or using the new chemical substance in either the same physical form described in the notice under paragraph (e), or in a physical form which will not increase the human exposure to or environmental release of the new chemical substance over those exposures or releases resulting from the specified physical form (e.g., a manufacturer which specifies that the new chemical substance will be produced in a non-volatile liquid form generally may not change to a respirable powder form).

(3) The annual production volume of chemical substances manufactured under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for which the manufacturer designated a binding annual production volume pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section must not exceed that designated volume.

(4) Any person who manufactures a new chemical substance under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section must comply with the provisions of this section, including submission of a new notice under paragraph (e) of this section, before:

(i) Manufacturing the new chemical substance at a site that was not approved in a previous exemption notice for the substance, except as provided in paragraph (j)(6) of this section.

(ii) Manufacturing the new chemical substance for a use that was not approved in a previous exemption notice for the substance.

(iii) Manufacturing the new chemical substance without employing the human exposure and environmental release controls approved in a previous exemption notice for the substance.

(iv) Manufacturing the new chemical substance in a physical form different than that physical form approved in a previous exemption notice for the substance and which form may increase the human exposure to, or environmental release of, the new chemical substance over those exposures or releases resulting from the physical form approved in the previous notice.

(v) Manufacturing the chemical substance in annual production volumes above any volume designated by the manufacturer as binding under paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section in a previous exemption notice for the substance.

(5) In an exemption notice informing EPA of a change in site, use, or worker protection, or environmental release controls, the manufacturer is not required to provide all of the same information submitted to EPA in a previous exemption notice for that chemical substance. The new exemption notice, however, must indicate the identity of the new chemical substance; the manufacturer's name; the name and telephone number of a technical contact; and location of the new site, new worker protection or environmental release controls, and new use information. The notice must also include the EPA-designated exemption number assigned to the previous notice and a new certification by the manufacturer, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of this section.

(6)(i) A manufacturer may, without submitting a new notice, manufacture the new chemical substance at a site not listed in its exemption application under the following conditions:

(A) the magnitude, frequency, and duration of exposure of individual workers to the new chemical substance at the new manufacturing site is equal to, or less than, the magnitude, frequency, and duration of exposure of the individual workers to the new chemical substance at the manufacturing site for which the EPA performed its original risk-assessment pursuant to the original exemption notice; and
