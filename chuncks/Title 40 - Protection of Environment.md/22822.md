(3) When must I perform an SVA? You must perform an audit of the measured sample volume (the sampling flow rate for a known time) once per quarter for applicable PM CEMS with an extractive sampling system. Also, you must perform and pass an SVA prior to initiation of any of the reference method data collection runs for an RCA or RRA.

(4) How do I perform an SVA? You perform an SVA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (4)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) You perform an SVA by independently measuring the volume of sample gas extracted from the stack or duct over each batch cycle or time period with a calibrated device. You may make this measurement either at the inlet or outlet of your PM CEMS, so long as it measures the sample gas volume without including any dilution or recycle air. Compare the measured volume with the volume reported by your PM CEMS for the same cycle or time period to calculate sample volume accuracy.
