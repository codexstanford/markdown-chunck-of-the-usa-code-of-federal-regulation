## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 65 - CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL AIR RULE
##### Subpart G - Closed Vent Systems, Control Devices, and Routing to a Fuel Gas System or a Process
###### ยง 65.163 Other records.
####### Regulated source and control equipment startup, shutdown and malfunction records.

(c)(1) Records of the occurrence and duration of each startup, shutdown, and malfunction of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment used to comply with this part during which excess emissions (as defined in ยง 65.3(a)(4)) occur.

(2) For each startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions occur, records whether the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and a description of actions taken to minimize emissions. For example, if a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing control device emissions to a backup control device (for example, the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a checklist or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.

(3) Records of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and continuous monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2A process vents.
