######## Specific labels.

(b)Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, fuel economy and COemissions for specific labels may be determined by one of two methods. The first is based on vehicle-specific configuration 5-cycle data as determined in ยง 600.207. This method is available for all vehicles and is required for vehicles that do not qualify for the second method as described in ยง 600.115 (other than electric vehicles). The second method, the derived 5-cycle method, determines fuel economy and COemissions values from the FTP and HFET tests using equations that are derived from vehicle-specific 5-cycle configuration data, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may voluntarily lower fuel economy values and raise COvalues if they determine that the label values from either method are not representative of the fuel economy or COemissions for that model type.
