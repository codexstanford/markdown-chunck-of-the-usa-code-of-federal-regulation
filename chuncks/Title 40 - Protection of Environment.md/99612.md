(2) For incomplete heavy-duty vehicles, and for engines used in vehicles you do not produce, you do not need to certify your engines to evaporative and refueling emission standards or otherwise meet those standards.

Also, your engines must meet applicable exhaust emission standards in the installed configuration.
