(b)The equations governing SSV flow assume one-dimensional isentropic inviscid flow of an ideal gas. Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section describes other assumptions that may apply. If good engineering judgment dictates that you account for gas compressibility, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values ofas a function of measured pressure and temperature, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment. Note that the equation for the flow coefficient,, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent,, is equal to the ratio of specific heats,/If good engineering judgment dictates using a real gas isentropic exponent, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values ofas a function of measured pressure and temperature, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment.
