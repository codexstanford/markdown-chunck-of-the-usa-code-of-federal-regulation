###### ยง 1066.845 AC17 air conditioning efficiency test procedure.
####### Ambient conditions.

(c)Measure and control ambient conditions as specified in ยง 1066.835(f), except that you must control ambient temperature during emission sampling to (22.0 to 28.0) &#xB0;C throughout the test and (23.5 to 26.5) &#xB0;C on average. These tolerances apply to the combined SC03 and HFET drive cycles during emission sampling. Note that you must set the same ambient temperature target for both the air conditioning on and off portions of emission sampling. Control ambient temperature during the preconditioning cycle and 30 minute soak to (25.0 +/- 5.0) &#xB0;C. For these same modes with no emission sampling, target the specified ambient humidity levels, but you do not need to meet the humidity tolerances. Note that solar heating is disabled for certain test intervals as described in this section.
