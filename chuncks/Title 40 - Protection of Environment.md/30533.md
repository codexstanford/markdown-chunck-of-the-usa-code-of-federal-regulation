####### Process shutdown

means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process shutdowns.
