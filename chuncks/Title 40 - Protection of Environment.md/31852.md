####### Emissions profile by process.

(A)The emissions profile must consider all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device during the period of absolute peak-case conditions specified in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as appropriate. Emissions per episode shall be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. When complying with paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section, emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode if the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.
