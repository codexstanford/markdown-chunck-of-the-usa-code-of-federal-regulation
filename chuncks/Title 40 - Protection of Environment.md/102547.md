####### Work.

(a)Use good engineering judgment to simulate all engine work inputs and outputs as they typically would operate in use. Account for work inputs and outputs during an emission test by measuring them; or, if they are small, you may show by engineering analysis that disregarding them does not affect your ability to determine the net work output by more than +/-0.5% of the net expected work output over the test interval. Use equipment to simulate the specific types of work, as follows:
