####### Summary of the Method.

1.2The output from an instrument capable of continuously measuring PM concentration is continuously recorded, either in milliamps, PM concentration, or other units of measure. An operating limit for the PM CPMS is established initially, based on data recorded by the monitoring system during a performance stack test. The performance test is repeated annually, and the operating limit is reassessed. In-between successive performance tests, the output from the PM CPMS serves as an indicator of continuous compliance with the applicable emissions limit.
