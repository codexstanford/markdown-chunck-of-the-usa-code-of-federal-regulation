The amounts of the State's Annual EGU NOBudget and Annual Non-EGU NOReduction Requirement shall be determined as follows:

(1)(i) The Annual EGU NOBudget for the State is defined as the total amount of NOemissions from all EGUs in that State for a year, if the State meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by imposing control measures, at least in part, on EGUs. If the State imposes control measures under this section on only EGUs, the Annual EGU NOBudget for the State shall not exceed the amount, during the indicated periods, specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(ii) The Annual Non-EGU NOReduction Requirement, if applicable, is defined as the total amount of NOemission reductions that the State demonstrates, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, it will achieve from non-EGUs during the appropriate period. If the State meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by imposing control measures on only non-EGUs, then the State's Annual Non-EGU NOReduction Requirement shall equal or exceed, during the appropriate periods, the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
