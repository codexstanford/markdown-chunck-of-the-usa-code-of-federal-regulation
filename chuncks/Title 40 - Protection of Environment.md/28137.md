###### ยง 63.786 Test methods and procedures.

(a) For the compliance procedures described in ยง 63.785(c) (1) through (c)(3), Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the definitive method for determining the VOC content of coatings, as supplied or as applied. When a coating or thinner contains exempt compounds that are volatile HAP or VOHAP, the owner or operator shall ensure, when determining the VOC content of a coating, that the mass of these exempt compounds is included.

(b) For the compliance procedure described in ยง 63.785(c)(4), the Administrator must approve the test method for determining the VOHAP content of coatings and thinners. As part of the approval, the test method must meet the specified accuracy limits indicated below for sensitivity, duplicates, repeatability, and reproducibility coefficient of variation each determined at the 95 percent confidence limit. Each percentage value below is the corresponding coefficient of variation multiplied by 2.8 as in the ASTM Method E180-93: Standard Practice for Determining the Precision of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testing of Industrial Chemicals (incorporation by reference-see ยง 63.14).
