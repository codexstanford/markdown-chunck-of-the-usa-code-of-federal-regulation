(2)(i) When the Director receives any information (for example, where the Director inspects the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as required in the permit, receives a request for modification or revocation and reissuance under ยง 501.15(d)(2)(i), or conducts a review of the permit file), he or she may determine whether or not one or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section for modification or revocation and reissuance or both exist.

A draft permit must be prepared and other procedures in ยง 501.15(d) followed. If cause does not exist under this section, the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit.
