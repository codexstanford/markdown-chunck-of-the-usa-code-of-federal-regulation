(3)If you certify any model year 2027 engines to 40 CFR part 86, subpart A, under paragraph (t)(1) of this section, certify the engine family by dividing the model year into two partial model years. The first portion of the model year starts when it would normally start and ends when you no longer produce engines meeting standards under 40 CFR part 86, subpart A, on or before December 20, 2026. The second portion of the model year starts when you begin producing engines meeting standards under this part 1036, and ends on the day your model year would normally end. The following additional provisions apply for model year 2027 if you split the model year as described in this paragraph (t):

(i) You may generate emission credits only with engines that are certified under this part 1036.

(ii) In your production report under ยง 1036.250(a), identify production volumes separately for the two parts of the model year.

(iii) OBD testing demonstrations apply singularly for the full model year.
