######### Application.

(a)You may use a nondispersive ultraviolet (NDUV) analyzer to measure NOconcentration in raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling. We generally accept an NDUV for NOmeasurement, even though it measures only NO and NO, since conventional engines and aftertreatment systems do not emit significant amounts of other NOspecies. Measure other NOspecies if required by the standard-setting part. Note that good engineering judgment may preclude you from using an NDUV analyzer if sampled exhaust from test engines contains oil (or other contaminants) in sufficiently high concentrations to interfere with proper operation.
