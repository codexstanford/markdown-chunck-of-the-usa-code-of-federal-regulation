####### Spark Plugs.

(8)(i) The emission critical parameters for spark plugs are:

(A) Heat Rating.

(B) Gap Spacing.

(C) Gap Location.

(D) Flashover.

(E) Dielectric Strength.

(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph:

(A) "Spark Plug" means a device to suitably deliver high tension electrical ignition voltage to the spark gap in the engine combustion chamber.

(B) "Heat Rating" means that measurement of engine indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) value obtained on the engine at a point when the supercharge pressure is 25.4mm (one inch) Hg below the preignition point of the spark plug, as rated according to SAE J549A Recommended Practice.

(C) "Gap Spacing" means the distance between the center electrode and the ground electrode where the high voltage ignition arc is discharged.

(D) "Gap Location" means the position of the electrode gap in the combustion chamber.

(E) "Dielectric Strength" means the ability of the spark plug's ceramic insulator material to resist electrical breakdown.

(F) "Flashover" means the discharge of ignition voltage at any point other than at the spark plug gap.
