5.2Measure the noise level of the system in each analytical region using the procedure of appendix G of this addendum. If any noise level is higher than that estimated for the system in section 4.12 of this addendum, repeat the calculations of appendix D of this addendum and verify that the requirements of section 4.12 of this addendum are met; if they are not, adjust or repair the instrument and repeat this section.

5.3 Determine the Sample Absorption Pathlength

Record a background spectrum. Then, fill the absorption cell with CTS at the pressure Pand record a set of CTS spectra [R3]. Store the background and unscaled CTS single beam interferograms and spectra. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the sample absorption pathlength (L) for each analytical region. The values Lshall not differ from the approximated sample pathlength L&#x2032; (see section 4.4 of this addendum) by more than 5 percent.
