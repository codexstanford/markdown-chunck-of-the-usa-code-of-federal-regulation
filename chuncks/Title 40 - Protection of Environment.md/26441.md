####### Oxygen concentration correction procedures.

(k)To demonstrate compliance with the total HAP concentration limit of 20 ppmv in ยง 63.443(d)(2), the concentration measured using the methods specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall be corrected to 10 percent oxygen using the following procedures:

(1) The emission rate correction factor and excess air integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Methods 3A or 3B of part 60, appendix A-2 shall be used to determine the oxygen concentration. The samples shall be taken at the same time that the HAP samples are taken. As an alternative to Method 3B, ASME PTC 19.10-1981 [Part 10] may be used (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14(i)(1)).

(2) The concentration corrected to 10 percent oxygen shall be computed using the following equation:
