######## Test setup.

(e)(1) The candidate test sampler shall have its inlet and impactor or impactors removed. The lower end of the down tube shall be reconnected to the filter holder, using an extension of the downtube, if necessary. If the candidate sampler has a separate impactor for each channel, then for this test, the filter holder assemblies must be connected to the physical location on the sampler where the impactors would normally connect.

(2) The test particle delivery system shall be connected to the sampler downtube so that the test aerosol is introduced at the top of the downtube.
