(1) For the "transient" phase of the cold-start test, assume V= 0.0077934 mper rev; N = 12,115; R = 20.5 pct; R= 20.5 pct; P= 99.05 kPa; P= 3.382 kPa; P= 9.851 kPa; T= 309.8 &#xB0;K; HC= 249.75 ppm carbon equivalent; NOx= 38.30 ppm; CO= 311.23 ppm; CO= 0.415 percent; HC= 4.90 ppm; NOx= 0.30 ppm; CO= 8.13 ppm; CO= 0.037 pct; D= 5.650 km.

(i) V= [(0.0077934)(12,115)(99.05-9.851)(293.15)]/ [(101.325)(309.8)] = 78.651 mper test phase.

(ii) H = [(6.211)(20.5)(3.382)]/[(99.05) - (3.382)(20.5/100)] = 4.378 grams HO per kg dry air.

(iii) K= 1/[1 - 0.0329(4.378 - 10.71)] = 0 8276

(iv) CO= [1 - 0.01925(0.415) - 0.000323 (20.5)](311.23) = 306.68 ppm.

(ii) NOx= 0.43 [(4.733 = 2.154)/(5.650 = 6.070)] = 0.57 [(7.056 = 2.154)/(5.660 = 6.070)] = 0.700 gram per vehicle kilometer.

(iii) CO= 0.43 [(27.362 + 64.541)/(5.650 + 6.070)] + 0.57 [(34.964 + 64.541)/(5.660 + 6.070)] = 8.207 grams per vehicle kilometer.
