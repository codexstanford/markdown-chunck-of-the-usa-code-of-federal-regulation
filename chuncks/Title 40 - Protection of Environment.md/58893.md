(4) Each table identifies the test substance that is required to be tested to satisfy the data requirement. Test substances may include: technical grade active ingredient (TGAI), manufacturing-use product (MP), end-use product (EP), typical end-use product (TEP), residue of concern, and pure active ingredient (PAI) or all of the above (All). Commas between the test substances (, TGAI, EP) indicate that data may be required on the TGAI or EP or both depending on the conditions set forth in the test note. Data requirements which list two test substances (, TGAI and EP) indicate that both are required to be tested. Data requirements that list only MP as the test substance apply to products containing solely the technical grade of the active ingredient and manufacturing-use products to which other ingredients have been intentionally added. Data requirements listing the EP as the test substance apply to any EP with an ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient that is expected to enhance the toxicity of the product.
