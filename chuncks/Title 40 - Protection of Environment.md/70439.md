###### Drinking water threat-waste characteristics.

4.1.2.2Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances that are available to migrate from the sources at the site to surface water in the watershed via the overland/flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed (see section 4.1.1.1). Such hazardous substances include:

- Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water in the watershed.

- All hazardous substances associated with a source that has a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).
