###### Persistent oils

1.2.8include:

(1) A petroleum-based oil that does not meet the distillation criteria for a non-persistent oil. Persistent oils are further classified based on specific gravity as follows:

(A) Group 2-specific gravity less than 0.85;

(B) Group 3-specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.85 and less than 0.95;

(C) Group 4-specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.95 and less than 1.0; or

(D) Group 5-specific gravity equal to or greater than 1.0.

(2) A non-petroleum oil, other than an animal fat or vegetable oil, with a specific gravity of 0.8 or greater. These oils are further classified based on specific gravity as follows:

(A) Group 2-specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.8 and less than 0.85;

(B) Group 3-specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.85 and less than 0.95;

(C) Group 4-specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.95 and less than 1.0; or

(D) Group 5-specific gravity equal to or greater than 1.0.
