####### General cycle restriction.

(b)Locomotives subject to both switch cycle standards and line-haul cycle standards (such as Tier 2 locomotives) may generate both switch and line-haul credits. Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, such credits may only be used to show compliance with standards for the same cycle for which they were generated. For example, a Tier 2 locomotive that is certified to a switch cycle NOFEL below the applicable switch cycle standard and a line-haul cycle NOFEL below the applicable line-haul cycle standard may generate switch cycle NOcredits for use in complying with switch cycle NOstandards and a line-haul cycle NOcredits for use in complying with line-haul cycle NOstandards.
