###### ยง 60.252 Standards for thermal dryers.

(a) On and after the date on which the performance test is conducted or required to be completed under ยง 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of a thermal dryer constructed, reconstructed, or modified on or before April 28, 2008, subject to the provisions of this subpart must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the thermal dryer any gases which contain PM in excess of 0.070 g/dscm (0.031 grains per dry standard cubic feet (gr/dscf)); and

(2) The owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the thermal dryer any gases which exhibit 20 percent opacity or greater.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test is conducted or required to be completed under ยง 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of a thermal dryer constructed, reconstructed, or modified after April 28, 2008, subject to the provisions of this subpart must meet the applicable standards for PM and opacity, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, and except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test is conducted or required to be completed under ยง 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of a thermal dryer constructed, reconstructed, or modified after May 29, 2009, subject to the provisions of this subpart must also meet the applicable standards for sulfur dioxide (SO), and combined nitrogen oxides (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator must meet the requirements for PM emissions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable to the affected facility.

(i) For each thermal dryer constructed or reconstructed after April 28, 2008, the owner or operator must meet the requirements of (b)(1)(i)(A) and (b)(1)(i)(B).

(A) The owner or operator must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the thermal dryer any gases that contain PM in excess of 0.023 g/dscm (0.010 grains per dry standard cubic feet (gr/dscf)); and

(B) The owner or operator must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the thermal dryer any gases that exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater.

(ii) For each thermal dryer modified after April 28, 2008, the owner or operator must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

(A) The owner or operator must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases which contain PM in excess of 0.070 g/dscm (0.031 gr/dscf); and

(B) The owner or operator must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases which exhibit 20 percent opacity or greater.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for each thermal dryer constructed, reconstructed, or modified after May 27, 2009, the owner or operator must meet the requirements for SOemissions in either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected facility any gases that contain SOin excess of 85 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input; or
