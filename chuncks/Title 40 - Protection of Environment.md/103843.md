(vi) Calculate the Reynolds number,, for each reference flow rate at standard conditions,, using the throat diameter of the venturi,, and the air density at standard conditions,. Because the dynamic viscosity,, is needed to compute, you may use your own fluid viscosity model to determinefor your calibration gas (usually air), using good engineering judgment. Alternatively, you may use the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model to approximate, as shown in the following sample calculation for:

Where, using the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model:

(vii) Calculateusing the following equation:
