####### Noncritical emission-related maintenance.

(d)You may specify any amount of emission-related inspection or other maintenance that is not approved critical emission-related maintenance under paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix A, that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or other maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
