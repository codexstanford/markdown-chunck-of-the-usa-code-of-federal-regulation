(2)1Heterozygous Ffemales from the above crosses shall be allowed to mate individually (i.e., one female per vial) with their brothers. In the Fgeneration, each culture shall be scored for the absence of wild-type males. If a culture appears to have arisen from an Ffemale carrying a lethal in the parental X-chromosome (i.e., no males with the treated chromosome are observed), daughters of that female with the same genotype shall be tested to ascertain if the lethality is repeated in the next generation.
