(i)means the capability of a POTW treatment system to oxidize ammonia or ammonium salts initially to nitrites (viabacteria) and subsequently to nitrates (viabacteria). Criteria for determining the nitrification capability of a POTW treatment system are: bioassays confirming the presence of nitrifying bacteria; and analyses of the nitrogen balance demonstrating a reduction in the concentration of ammonia or ammonium salts and an increase in the concentrations of nitrites and nitrates.
