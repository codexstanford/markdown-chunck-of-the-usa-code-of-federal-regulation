(b) The process of determiningbegins with determining what catalyst characteristic will be tracked as the basis for measuring thermal deactivation. This metric varies for each type of catalyst and may be determined from the experimental data using good engineering judgment. We recommend the following metrics; however, you may also use a different metric based on good engineering judgment:
