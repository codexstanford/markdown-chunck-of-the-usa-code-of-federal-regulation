######## Heat input rate.

(e)The owner or operator of an affected unit using a common stack, bypass stack, or multiple stacks shall account for heat input rate according to the following:

(1) The owner or operator of an affected unit using a common stack, bypass stack, or multiple stack with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor on each stack may use the flow rate and diluent monitors to determine the heat input rate for the affected unit, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except that the term "heat input rate" shall apply rather than "SOmass emissions" or "emissions" and the phrase "a diluent monitor and a flow monitor" shall apply rather than "SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system." The applicable equation in appendix F to this part shall be used to calculate the heat input rate from the hourly flow rate, diluent monitor measurements, and (if the equation in appendix F requires a correction for the stack gas moisture content) hourly moisture measurements. Notwithstanding the options for combining heat input rate in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor installed on a common stack to determine the combined heat input rate at the common stack shall also determine and report heat input rate to each individual unit, according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

(2) In the event that an owner or operator of a unit with a bypass stack does not install and certify a diluent monitor and flow monitoring system in a bypass stack, the owner or operator shall determine total heat input rate to the unit for each unit operating hour during which the bypass stack is used according to the missing data provisions for heat input rate under § 75.36 or the procedures for calculating heat input rate from fuel sampling and analysis in section 5.5 of appendix F to this part.

(3) The owner or operator of an affected unit with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor installed on a common stack to determine heat input rate at the common stack may choose to apportion the heat input rate from the common stack to each affected unit utilizing the common stack by using either of the following two methods, provided that all of the units utilizing the common stack are combusting fuel with the same F-factor found in section 3 of appendix F of this part. The heat input rate may be apportioned either by using the ratio of load (in MWe) for each individual unit to the total load for all units utilizing the common stack or by using the ratio of steam load (in 1000 lb/hr or mmBtu/hr thermal output) for each individual unit to the total steam load for all units utilizing the common stack, in conjunction with the appropriate unit and stack operating times. If using either of these apportionment methods, the owner or operator shall apportion according to section 5.6 of appendix F to this part.

(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, any affected unit that is using the procedures in this part to meet the monitoring and reporting requirements of a State or federal NOmass emission reduction program must also meet the requirements for monitoring heat input rate in §§ 75.71, 75.72 and 75.75.
