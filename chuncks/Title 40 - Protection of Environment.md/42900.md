(f) Except as provided in paragraph (e), no RATA performed pursuant to ยง 75.74(c)(2)(ii), section 6.5 of appendix A to this part or section 2.3.1 of appendix B to this part, and no stack test under ยง 75.19 or Appendix E to this part (or portion of such a RATA or stack test) conducted by an AETB (as defined in ยง 72.2) shall be invalidated under this part as a result of the failure of the AETB to conform to ASTM D7036-04 (incorporated by reference,ยง 75.6). Validation of such tests is determined based on the other part 75 testing requirements. EPA recommends that proper observation of tests and review of test results continue, regardless of whether an AETB fully conforms to ASTM D7036-04.
