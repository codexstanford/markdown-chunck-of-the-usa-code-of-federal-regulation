###### ยง 798.5500 Differential growth inhibition of repair proficient and repair deficient bacteria: "Bacterial DNA damage or repair tests."
####### Test method,Principle.

(d)-(1)The tests detect agents that interact with cellular DNA to produce growth inhibition or killing. This interaction is recognized by specific cellular repair systems. The assays are based upon the use of paired bacterial strains that differ by the presence of absence of specific DNA repair genes. The response is expressed in the preferential inhibition of growth or the preferential killing of the DNA repair deficient strain since it is incapable of removing certain chemical lesions from its DNA.
