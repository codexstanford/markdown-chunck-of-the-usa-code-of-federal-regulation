(1)For each primary catalyst component, generate a target line which describes the relationship between aging hours on the cycle and cumulative deactivation,Generate control limit lines that are +/-3% of the target line. You must remain within these control limits over the course of aging. Adjust aging parameters as needed to remain within these limits for the primary catalyst components. For each secondary catalyst component, generate both a targetline and a line describing the target behavior of the aging metric directly. You must remain within either +/-10% of either theline or +/-3% of the aging metric target line for any secondary catalyst component. Adjust aging parameters as needed to remain within these limits noting that you must remain within limits for the primary components. Adjusting the secondary catalyst aging may require altering heat transfer through the system to make it more representative of the field aging.
