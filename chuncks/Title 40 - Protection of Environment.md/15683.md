####### Test for comparability.

(l)(1) For each filter or analytical sample pair, calculate all nine possible percent differences (D) between the reference and candidate methods, using all nine possible combinations of the three determinations (A, B, and C) for each method using equation 6 of this section:

(2) If none of the percent differences (D) exceeds +/-20 percent, the candidate method passes the test for comparability.

(3) If one or more of the percent differences (D) exceed +/-20 percent, the candidate method fails the test for comparability.

(4) The candidate method must pass both the precision test (paragraph (k) of this section) and the comparability test (paragraph (l) of this section) to qualify for designation as an equivalent method.
