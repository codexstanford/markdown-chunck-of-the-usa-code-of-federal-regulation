###### Mobility.

3.2.1.2Assign a mobility factor value to each hazardous substance for the aquifer being evaluated as follows:

- For any hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to one or more aquifers underlying the sources at the site, regardless of the aquifer being evaluated, assign a mobility factor value of 1.

- For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to at least one of the aquifers, assign that hazardous substance a mobility factor value from table 3-8 for the aquifer being evaluated, based on its water solubility and distribution coefficient (K).

- If the hazardous substance cannot be assigned a mobility factor value because data on its water solubility or distribution coefficient are not available, use other hazardous substances for which information is available in evaluating the pathway.

- If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated can be assigned a mobility factor value, use a default value of 0.002 as the mobility factor value for all these hazardous substances.

Determine the water solubility to be used in table 3-8 for the hazardous substance as follows (use this same water solubility for all aquifers):

- For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the hazardous substance is present or deposited as a liquid, use the water solubility category "Present as Liquid" in table 3-8 to assign the mobility factor value to that hazardous substance.

- Otherwise:

For the aquifer being evaluated, determine the distribution coefficient to be used in table 3-8 for the hazardous substance as follows:

- For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the entire interval from a source at the site to the aquifer being evaluated is karst, use the distribution coefficient category "Karst" in table 3-8 in assigning the mobility factor value for that hazardous substance for that aquifer.

- Otherwise:
