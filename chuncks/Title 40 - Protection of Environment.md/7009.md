Vertical flow is treated for the plume component above the critical dividing streamline height (H);"Plume Behavior."

Horizontal dispersion for stable/neutral conditions is related to the turbulence velocity scale for lateral fluctuations, &#x3C3;v, for which a minimum value of 0.2 m/s is used. Convective scaling formulations are used to estimate horizontal dispersion for unstable conditions.
