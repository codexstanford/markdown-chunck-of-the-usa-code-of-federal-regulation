(c) For a concentration measurement where you did not remove water, you may setequal to. You may determine the amount of water at the flow meter,, using any of the following methods:

(1) Measure the dewpoint and absolute pressure and calculate the amount of water as described in ยง 1065.645.

(2) If the measurement comes from raw exhaust, you may determine the amount of water based on intake-air humidity, plus a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust as described in ยง 1065.655.

(3) If the measurement comes from diluted exhaust, you may determine the amount of water based on intake-air humidity, dilution air humidity, and a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust as described in ยง 1065.655.

(d) Perform a removed water correction to the concentration measurement using the following equation:
