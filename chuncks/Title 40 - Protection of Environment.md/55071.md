####### Water quality criteria.

(ii)(A) Bacteriological Criteria. The geometric mean of the enterococci bacteria densities in samples taken over a 30 day period shall not exceed 33/100 ml, nor shall any single sample exceed an enterococci density of 150 per 100 milliliters. These limits are calculated as the geometric mean of the collected samples approximately equally spaced over a thirty day period.

(B) Dissolved oxygen-no measurable decrease from natural conditions.

(C) Total dissolved gas concentrations shall not exceed 110 percent of the saturation value for gases at the existing atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures at any point of sample collection.

(D) Temperature-no measurable change from natural conditions.

(E) pH-no measurable change from natural conditions.

(F) Turbidity shall not exceed 5 NTU over natural conditions.

(G) Toxic, radioactive, nonconventional, or deleterious material concentrations shall be less than those which may affect public health, the natural aquatic environment, or the desirability of the water for any use.
