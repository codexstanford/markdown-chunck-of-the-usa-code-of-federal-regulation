####### Test methods.

(d)(1) The following test methods in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine compliance under §§ 63.1157(a), 63.1157(b), 63.1158(a), and 63.1158(b) of this subpart:

(i) Method 1, to determine the number and location of sampling points, with the exception that no traverse point shall be within one inch of the stack or duct wall;

(ii) Method 2, to determine gas velocity and volumetric flow rate;

(iii) Method 3, to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas;

(iv) Method 4, to determine the moisture content of the stack gas; and

(v) Method 26A, "Determination of Hydrogen Halide and Halogen Emissions from Stationary Sources-Isokinetic Method," to determine the HCl mass flows at the inlet and outlet of a control device or the concentration of HCl discharged to the atmosphere, and also to determine the concentration of Cldischarged to the atmosphere from acid regeneration plants. If compliance with a collection efficiency standard is being demonstrated, inlet and outlet measurements shall be performed simultaneously. The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 60 minutes and the minimum sample volume 0.85 dry standard cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). The concentrations of HCl and Clshall be calculated for each run as follows:

(2) The owner or operator may use equivalent alternative measurement methods approved by the Administrator.
