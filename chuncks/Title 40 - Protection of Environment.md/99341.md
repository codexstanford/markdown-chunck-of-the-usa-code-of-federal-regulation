###### ยง 1033.515 Discrete-mode steady-state emission tests of locomotives and locomotive engines.
####### Engines certified to a PM standard/FEL at or above 0.05 g/bhp-hr.

(1)Use a separate PM filter sample for each test mode of the locomotive test cycle according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a) through (c) of this section. You may ask to use a shorter sampling period if the total mass expected to be collected would cause unacceptably high pressure drop across the filter before reaching the end of the required sampling time. We will not allow sampling times shorter than 60 seconds. When we conduct locomotive emission tests, we will adhere to the time limits for each of the numbered modes in Table 1 to this section.
