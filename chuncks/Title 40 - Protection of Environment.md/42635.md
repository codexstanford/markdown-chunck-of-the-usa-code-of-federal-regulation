####### Audit decertification.

(1)Whenever both an audit of a continuous emission or opacity monitoring system (or component thereof, including the data acquisition and handling system), of any excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part, or of any alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part, and a review of the initial certification application or of a recertification application, reveal that any system or component should not have been certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular performance specification or other requirement of this part, both at the time of the initial certification or recertification application submission and at the time of the audit, the Administrator will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification status of such system or component. For the purposes of this paragraph, an audit shall be either a field audit of the facility or an audit of any information submitted to EPA or the State agency regarding the facility. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the certification status is revoked prospectively by the Administrator. The data measured and recorded by each system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the notification of the revoked certification status until the date and time that the owner or operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or recertification tests. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures in ยง 75.20(a)(5) for initial certification or ยง 75.20(b)(5) for recertification to replace, prospectively, all of the invalid, non-quality-assured data for each disapproved system.
