###### § 75.10 General operating requirements.
####### Primary Measurement Requirement.

(a)The owner or operator shall measure opacity, and all SO, NO, and COemissions for each affected unit as follows:

(1) To determine SOemissions, the owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements of this part, a SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system with an automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording SOconcentration (in ppm), volumetric gas flow (in scfh), and SOmass emissions (in lb/hr) discharged to the atmosphere, except as provided in §§ 75.11 and 75.16 and subpart E of this part;

(2) To determine NOemissions, the owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements of this part, a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system (consisting of a NOpollutant concentration monitor and an Oor COdiluent gas monitor) with an automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording NOconcentration (in ppm), Oor COconcentration (in percent Oor CO) and NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) discharged to the atmosphere, except as provided in §§ 75.12 and 75.17 and subpart E of this part. The owner or operator shall account for total NOemissions, both NO and NO, either by monitoring for both NO and NOor by monitoring for NO only and adjusting the emissions data to account for NO;

(3) The owner or operator shall determine COemissions by using one of the following options, except as provided in § 75.13 and subpart E of this part:

(i) The owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements of this part, a COcontinuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system with an automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording COconcentration (in ppm or percent), volumetric gas flow (in scfh), and COmass emissions (in tons/hr) discharged to the atmosphere;

(ii) The owner or operator shall determine COemissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the procedures in appendix G of this part to estimate COemissions (in ton/day) discharged to the atmosphere; or

(iii) The owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements of this part, a flow monitoring system and a COcontinuous emission monitoring system that uses an Oconcentration monitor to determine COemissions (according to the procedures in appendix F of this part) with an automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording Oconcentration (in percent), COconcentration (in percent), volumetric gas flow (in scfh), and COmass emissions (in tons/hr) discharged to the atmosphere;

(4) The owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements in this part, a continuous opacity monitoring system with the automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording the opacity of emissions (in percent opacity) discharged to the atmosphere, except as provided in §§ 75.14 and 75.18; and

(5) A single certified flow monitoring system may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section. A single certified diluent monitor may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. A single automated data acquisition and handling system may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
