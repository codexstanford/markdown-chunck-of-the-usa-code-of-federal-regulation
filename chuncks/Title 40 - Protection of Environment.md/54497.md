####### Biological impact of discharge.

(c)(1) The applicant's modified discharge must allow for the attainment or maintenance of water quality which assures protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife.

(2) A balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife must exist:

(i) Immediately beyond the zone of initial dilution of the applicant's modified discharge; and

(ii) In all other areas beyond the zone of initial dilution where marine life is actually or potentially affected by the applicant's modified discharge.

(3) Conditions within the zone of initial dilution must not contribute to extreme adverse biological impacts, including, but not limited to, the destruction of distinctive habitats of limited distribution, the presence of disease epicenter, or the stimulation of phytoplankton blooms which have adverse effects beyond the zone of initial dilution.

(4) In addition, for modified discharges into saline estuarine water:

(i) Benthic populations within the zone of initial dilution must not differ substantially from the balanced indigenous populations which exist immediately beyond the boundary of the zone of initial dilution;

(ii) The discharge must not interfere with estuarine migratory pathways within the zone of initial dilution; and

(iii) The discharge must not result in the accumulation of toxic pollutants or pesticides at levels which exert adverse effects on the biota within the zone of initial dilution.
