####### Test facilities,Construction materials.

(2)-(i)Construction materials and equipment that contact stock solutions, test solutions, or dilution water into which test embryos or fish are placed should not contain any substances that can be leached or dissolved into aqueous solutions in quantities that can affect test results. Materials and equipment that contact stock or test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals from dilution water. Glass, #316 stainless steel, nylon screen and perfluorocarbon plastic (e.g., Teflon#) are acceptable materials. Concrete or rigid (unplasticized) plastic may be used for holding and acclimation tanks, and for water supply systems, but they should be thoroughly conditioned before use. If cast iron pipe is used in freshwater supply systems, colloidal iron may leach into the dilution water and strainers should be used to remove rust particles. Natural rubber, copper, brass, galvanized metal, epoxy glues, and flexible tubing should not come in contact with dilution water, stock solutions, or test solutions.
