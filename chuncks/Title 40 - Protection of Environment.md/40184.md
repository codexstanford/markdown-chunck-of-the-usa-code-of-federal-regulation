###### Select and Evaluate the Sampling System.

4.3Considering the source, e.g., temperature and pressure profiles, moisture content, analyte characteristics, and particulate concentration), select the equipment for extracting gas samples. Recommended are a particulate filter, heating system to maintain sample temperature above the dew point for all sample constituents at all points within the sampling system (including the filter), and sample conditioning system (e.g., coolers, water-permeable membranes that remove water or other compounds from the sample, and dilution devices) to remove spectral interferants or to protect the sampling and analytical components. Determine the minimum absolute sample system pressure (P, mmHg) and the infrared absorption cell volume (V, liter). Select the techniques and/or equipment for the measurement of sample pressures and temperatures.
