###### § 86.001-21 Application for certification.

Section 86.001-21 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from § 86.094-21 or § 86.096-21. Where a paragraph in § 86.094-21 or § 86.096-21 is identical and applicable to § 86.001-21, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement "[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21." or "[Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.096-21."

(a)-(b)(1)(i)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.094-21.

(b)(1)(i)(C) The manufacturer must submit a Statement of Compliance in the application for certification which attests to the fact that they have assured themselves that the engine family is designed to comply with the intermediate temperature cold testing criteria of subpart C of this part, and does not unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness of vehicles operating at high altitude or other conditions not experienced within the US06 (aggressive driving) and SC03 (air conditioning) test cycles.
