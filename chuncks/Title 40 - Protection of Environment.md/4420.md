###### Using the Multiple-Cylinder Method.

4.5 ProcedureUse the procedure for the dilution method with the following changes:

4.5.1 Use a multi-cylinder, dynamic calibration system such as the typical one shown in Figure 2.

4.5.2 The flowmeter need not be accurately calibrated, provided the flow in the output manifold can be verified to exceed the analyzer's flow demand.

4.5.3 The various CO calibration concentrations required in Steps 4.4.5, 4.4.6, and 4.4.7 are obtained without dilution by selecting zero air or the appropriate certified standard cylinder.
