In addition, the Facility shall maintain the following information for 5 years from the date of creation of the data and make such information available to EPA if requested: Unit-specific hourly heat input, Unit-specific hourly ammonia injection amounts, and Unit-specific hourly NOemission rate.

(2) In any periodic report submitted pursuant to this section, the Facility may incorporate by reference information previously submitted to EPA under its Title V permitting requirements, so long as that information is adequate to determine compliance with the emission limits and in the same electronic format as required for the periodic report, and provided that the Facility attaches the Title V Permit report (or the pertinent portions of such report) and provides a specific reference to the provisions of the Title V Permit report that are responsive to the information required in the periodic report.

In the report, the Facility shall explain the cause or causes of the exceedances and any measures taken or to be taken to cure the reported exceedances or to prevent such exceedances in the future. If, at any time, the provisions of this section are included in Title V Permits, consistent with the requirements for such inclusion in this section, then the deviation reports required under applicable Title V regulations shall be deemed to satisfy all the requirements of this paragraph (h)(3).
