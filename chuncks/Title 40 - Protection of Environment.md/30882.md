(viii)For each catalytic incinerator, the owner or operator shall monitor the temperature of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed. The owner or operator shall establish the minimum temperature of the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed and the minimum temperature difference across the catalyst bed as the site-specific operating parameter which must be monitored and recorded at least once every 15 minutes during the period in which the catalytic incinerator is functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this subpart.

(A) The temperature monitoring devices must be accurate to within +/-0.75 percent of the temperature measured in degrees Celsius or +/-2.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater.

(B) The temperature monitoring devices must be calibrated annually.
