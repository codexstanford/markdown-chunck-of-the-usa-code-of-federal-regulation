####### Cover

means a device or system which is placed on or over a waste placed in a waste management unit so that the entire waste surface area is enclosed and sealed to minimize air emissions. A cover may have openings necessary for operation, inspection, and maintenance of the waste management unit such as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells provided that each opening is closed and sealed when not in use. Example of covers include a fixed roof installed on a tank, a lid installed on a container, and an air-supported enclosure installed over a waste management unit.
