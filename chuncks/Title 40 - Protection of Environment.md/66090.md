####### Material determination procedure to determine average volatile organic (VO) concentration of a hazardous secondary material at the point of material origination.,Determining average VO concentration at the point of material origination.

(a)(1)A remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall determine the average VO concentration at the point of material origination for each hazardous secondary material placed in a hazardous secondary material management unit exempted under the provisions of § 261.1082(c)(1) of this subpart from using air emission controls in accordance with standards specified in §§ 261.1084 through 261.1087 of this subpart, as applicable to the hazardous secondary material management unit.

(i) An initial determination of the average VO concentration of the material stream shall be made before the first time any portion of the material in the hazardous secondary material stream is placed in a hazardous secondary material management unit exempted under the provisions of § 261.1082(c)(1) of this subpart from using air emission controls, and thereafter an initial determination of the average VO concentration of the material stream shall be made for each averaging period that a hazardous secondary material is managed in the unit; and

(ii) Perform a new material determination whenever changes to the source generating the material stream are reasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the hazardous secondary material to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the applicable VO concentration limits specified in § 261.1082 of this subpart.
