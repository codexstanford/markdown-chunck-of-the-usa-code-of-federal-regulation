() If construction of the kiln commenced after April 19, 1996 at a plant site where a cement kiln (whether burning hazardous waste or not) did not previously exist, hydrocarbons are limited to 50 parts per million by volume, over a 30-day block average (monitored continuously with a continuous monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane.

(6) Hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas in excess of 86 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) For particulate matter, both:

(i) Emissions in excess of 0.0069 gr/dscf corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(ii) Opacity greater than 20 percent, unless your source is equipped with a bag leak detection system under ยง 63.1206(c)(8) or a particulate matter detection system under ยง 63.1206(c)(9).
