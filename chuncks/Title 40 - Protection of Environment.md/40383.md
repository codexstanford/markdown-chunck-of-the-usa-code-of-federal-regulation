##### ยง 64.2 Applicability.
###### Exemption for backup utility power emissions units.

(2)The requirements of this part shall not apply to a utility unit, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, that is municipally-owned if the owner or operator provides documentation in a part 70 or 71 permit application that:

(i) The utility unit is exempt from all monitoring requirements in part 75 (including the appendices thereto) of this chapter;

(ii) The utility unit is operated for the sole purpose of providing electricity during periods of peak electrical demand or emergency situations and will be operated consistent with that purpose throughout the part 70 or 71 permit term. The owner or operator shall provide historical operating data and relevant contractual obligations to document that this criterion is satisfied; and

(iii) The actual emissions from the utility unit, based on the average annual emissions over the last three calendar years of operation (or such shorter time period that is available for units with fewer than three years of operation) are less than 50 percent of the amount in tons per year required for a source to be classified as a major source and are expected to remain so.
