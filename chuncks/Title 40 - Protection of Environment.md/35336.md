###### Emission Limitations
####### § 63.4691 What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
######## Emission rate with add-on controls option.

(c)Demonstrate that, based on the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation(s) and the emission reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit(s) in § 63.4690, calculated as a rolling 12-month emission rate and determined on a monthly basis. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) meet the operating limits required in § 63.4692, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4761(j), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.4693. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.4760 through 63.4768 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
