###### ยง 799.9305 TSCA Repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity study in rodents.
####### Description of the method,Selection of animal species.

(e)-(1)The preferred rodent species is the rat, although other rodent species may be used. Commonly used laboratory strains of young healthy adult animals should be employed. The females should be nulliparous and non-pregnant. Dosing should begin as soon as possible after weaning and, in any case, before the animals are 9 weeks old. At the commencement of the study the weight variation of animals used should be minimal and not exceed +/-20% of the mean weight of each sex. Where a repeated dose oral study is conducted as a preliminary to a long term study, preferably animals from the same strain and source should be used in both studies.
