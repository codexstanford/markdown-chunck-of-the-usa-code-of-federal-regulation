############### ยง 60.648 Optional procedure for measuring hydrogen sulfide in acid gas - Tutwiler Procedure.

(a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and HS concentration is ten grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than ten grains, a 500 ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample directly with a standard solution of iodine.
