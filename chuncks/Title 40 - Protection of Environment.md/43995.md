() A biointermediate producer may only change the designated renewable fuel production facility under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)() of this section for each biointermediate production facility one time per calendar year unless EPA, in its sole discretion, allows the biointermediate producer to change the designated renewable fuel production facility more frequently.

(3) All renewable fuel producers, foreign ethanol producers, and biointermediate producers must update registration information and submit an updated independent third-party engineering review according to the schedule in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, and include the information specified in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section, as applicable:

(i) For all renewable fuel producers and foreign ethanol producers registered in calendar year 2010, the updated registration information and independent third-party engineering review must be submitted to EPA by January 31, 2013, and by January 31 of every third calendar year thereafter; or

(ii) For all renewable fuel producers, foreign ethanol producers, and biointermediate producers registered in any calendar year after 2010, the updated registration information and independent third-party engineering review must be submitted to EPA by January 31 of every third calendar year after the first year of registration.

(iii) For all renewable fuel producers, in addition to conducting the engineering review and written report and verification required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the updated independent third-party engineering review must include a detailed review of the renewable fuel producer's calculations used to determine Vof a representative sample of batches of each type of renewable fuel produced since the last registration.
