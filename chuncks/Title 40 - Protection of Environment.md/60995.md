####### H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H

(3) A tolerance is established for residues of the herbicide hexazinone, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodity in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance level specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of hexazinone, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, and its metabolites: metabolite B, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, metabolite C, 3-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, metabolite C-2, 3-(3-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, and metabolite F, 3-cyclohexyl-6-amino-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of hexazinone, in or on the commodity.
