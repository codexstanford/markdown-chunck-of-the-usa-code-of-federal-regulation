For coal-fired EGUs greater than 200 MW located at greater than 750 MW power plants and operating without post-combustion controls (SCR or SNCR), we have provided presumptive NOlimits, differentiated by boiler design and type of coal burned. You may determine that an alternative control level is appropriate based on a careful consideration of the statutory factors. For coal-fired EGUs greater than 200 MW located at power plants 750 MW or less in size and operating without post-combustion controls, you should likewise presume that these same levels are cost-effective. You should require such utility boilers to meet the following NOemission limits, unless you determine that an alternative control level is justified based on consideration of the statutory factors. The following NOemission rates were determined based on a number of assumptions, including that the EGU boiler has enough volume to allow for installation and effective operation of separated overfire air ports. For boilers where these assumptions are incorrect, these emission limits may not be cost-effective.
