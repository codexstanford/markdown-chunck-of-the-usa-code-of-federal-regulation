####### Small business

(4)means any manufacturer, importer, or processor who meets either paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section:

(i) A business is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent (if any), are less than $40 million. However, if the annual manufacture, importation, or processing volume of a particular chemical substance at any individual site owned or controlled by the business is greater than 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds), the business shall not qualify as small for purposes of reporting on the manufacture, importation, or processing of that chemical substance at that site, unless the business qualifies as small under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.

(ii) A business is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $4 million, regardless of the quantity of the particular chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed by that business.

(iii) For imported and processed mixtures containing HEX-BCH, the 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds) standard in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section applies only to the amount of HEX-BCH in a mixture and not the other components of the mixture.
