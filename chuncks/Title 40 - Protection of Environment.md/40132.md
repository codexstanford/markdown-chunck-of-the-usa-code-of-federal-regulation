###### Analyte(s) and Tracer Gas.

7.1Obtain a certified gas cylinder mixture containing all of the analyte(s) at concentrations within +/-2 percent of the emission source levels (expressed in ppm-meter/K). If practical, the analyte standard cylinder shall also contain the tracer gas at a concentration which gives a measurable absorbance at a dilution factor of at least 10:1. Two ppm SFis sufficient for a path length of 22 meters at 250 &#xB0;F.
