####### Specialty coating

means a coating that, even though it meets the definition of a primer, topcoat, or self-priming topcoat, has additional performance criteria beyond those of primers, topcoats, and self-priming topcoats for specific applications. These performance criteria may include, but are not limited to, temperature or fire resistance, substrate compatibility, antireflection, temporary protection or marking, sealing, adhesively joining substrates, or enhanced corrosion protection. Individual specialty coatings are defined in appendix A to this subpart and in the CTG for Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Operations (EPA 453/R-97-004).
