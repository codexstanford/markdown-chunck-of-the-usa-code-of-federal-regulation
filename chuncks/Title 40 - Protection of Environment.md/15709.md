###### ยง 53.33 Test Procedure for Methods for Lead (Pb).
####### Method Detection Limit (MDL).
######## Test for additive and multiplicative bias (comparative slope and intercept).

(g)(1) For each test site, calculate the mean concentration measured by the reference method, R, using equation 17 of this section:

(2) For each test site, calculate the mean concentration measured by the candidate method, C, using equation 18 of this section:

(3) For each test site, calculate the linear regression slope and intercept of the mean candidate method measurements (C) against the mean reference method measurements (R), using equations 19 and 20 of this section, respectively:

(4) To pass this test, at each test site:

(i) The slope (calculated to at least 2 decimal places) must be in the interval specified for regression slope in table C-4 of this subpart; and

(ii) The intercept (calculated to at least 2 decimal places) must be in the interval specified for regression intercept in table C-4 of this subpart.

(iii) The slope and intercept limits are illustrated in figures C-2 and C-3 of this subpart.
