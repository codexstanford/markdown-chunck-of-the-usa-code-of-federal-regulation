###### General.

Use Schedule D.7 to calculate the horizon value of net cash flow projections for the Interim Controls Test. This horizon value is used in Schedule D.6. The computation of the horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.

In Schedule D.7, the applicant removes the tax savings of control equipment depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule D.7 are explained in the following instruction.
