######## Continuous emission monitoring system,CEMS

ormeans the equipment required under this subpart to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes and using an automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS), a permanent record of SOemissions, stack gas volumetric flow rate, stack gas moisture content, and Oor COconcentration (as applicable), in a manner consistent with part 75 of this chapter and §§ 97.630 through 97.635. The following systems are the principal types of continuous emission monitoring systems:

(1) A flow monitoring system, consisting of a stack flow rate monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic feet per hour (scfh);

(2) A SOmonitoring system, consisting of a SOpollutant concentration monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of SOemissions, in parts per million (ppm);

(3) A moisture monitoring system, as defined in § 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter and providing a permanent, continuous record of the stack gas moisture content, in percent HO;

(4) A COmonitoring system, consisting of a COpollutant concentration monitor (or an Omonitor plus suitable mathematical equations from which the COconcentration is derived) and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of COemissions, in percent CO; and

(5) An Omonitoring system, consisting of an Oconcentration monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of O, in percent O.
