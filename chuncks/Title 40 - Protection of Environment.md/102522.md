(iv) If you collect paired data for the paired-test in paragraph (e)(2) in this section, use caution when selecting sets from paired data for the-test. If you do this, select sets that do not mask the precision of the measurement procedure. We recommend selecting such sets only from data collected using the same engine, measurement instruments, and test cycle.
