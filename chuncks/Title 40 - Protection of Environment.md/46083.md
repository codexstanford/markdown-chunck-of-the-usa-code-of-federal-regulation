####### Fuel system malfunction criteria,Fuel system pressure control.

(ii)-(A)The OBD system must monitor the fuel system's ability to control to the desired fuel pressure. This monitoring must be done continuously unless new hardware has to be added, in which case the monitoring must be done at least once per drive cycle. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel system's pressure control system when the pressure control system is unable to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel system pressure control could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the commanded fuel system pressure cannot be delivered. For model year 2010 to 2012 engines with a unit injector fuel system, this requirement may be met by conducting a functional check of the fuel system pressure control in lieu of monitoring for conditions that could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds.
