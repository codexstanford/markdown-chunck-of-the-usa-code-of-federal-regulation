###### ยง 98.225 Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(a) For each missing value of nitric acid production, the substitute data shall be the best available estimate based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes (such as sales records).

(b) For missing values related to the performance test, including emission factors, production rate, and NO concentration, you must conduct a new performance test according to the procedures in ยง 98.224 (a) through (d).
