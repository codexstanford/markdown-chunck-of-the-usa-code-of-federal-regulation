() Annual emissions used in Equation 63 of this subpart must be based on the actual mass of organic compounds entering the control device, as calculated from the most representative emissions inventory data submitted within the 5 years before the Notification of Compliance Status report is due. The owner or operator must recalculate the system flowrate setpoint once every 5 years using the annual emissions from the most representative emissions inventory data submitted during the 5-year period after the previous calculation. Results of the initial calculation must be included in the Notification of Compliance Status report, and recalculated values must be included in the next Periodic report after each recalculation. For all calculations after the initial calculation, to use emissions inventory data calculated using procedures other than those specified in ยง 63.1257(d), the owner or operator must submit the emissions inventory data calculations and rationale for their use in the Notification of Process Change report or an application for a part 70 permit renewal or revision.
