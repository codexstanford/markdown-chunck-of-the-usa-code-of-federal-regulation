######## Preparation of reagents and solutions,n-Octanol and water.,n,n,n,n

(2)-(i)Very pure-octanol can be obtained as follows: Wash pure-octanol (minimum 98% pure) sequentially with 0.1N HSO, with 0.1N NaOH, then with distilled water until neutral. Dry the-octanol with magnesium sulfate and distill twice in a good distillation column under reduced pressure [b.p. about 80 &#xB0;C at 0.27 kPa (2 torr)]. The-octanol produced should be at least 99.9% pure. Alternatively, a grade equivalent to Fisher Scientific Co. No. A-402 "Certified Octanol-1" can be used. Reagent-grade water shall be used throughout the test procedure, such as ASTM Type II water, or an equivalent grade, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
