(B) Indiana Administrative Code, Title 326: Air Pollution Control Board, Article 8: Volatile Organic Compound Rules, Rule 7: Specific VOC Reduction Requirements for Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd Counties. Added at 181224-9, effective January 21, 1995.

(97) On October 25, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management requested a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan in the form of revisions to State Operating Permit Rules intended to satisfy Federal requirements for issuing federally enforceable State operating permits (FESOP) and thereby exempt certain small emission sources from review under the State's title V operating permit program. This FESOP rule is also approved for the purpose of providing federally enforceable emissions limits on hazardous air pollutants listed under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act. This revision took the form of an amendment to Title 326: Air Pollution Control Board of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC) 2-8 Federally Enforceable State Operating Permit Program.
