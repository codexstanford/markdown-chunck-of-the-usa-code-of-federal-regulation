####### Determination of Attainment:

(a)Effective February 6, 2013, EPA has determined that, based on 2009 to 2011 ambient air quality data, the Nogales PMnonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2006 PMNAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
