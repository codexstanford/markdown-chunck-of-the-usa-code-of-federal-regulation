7. The weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF) is the compliance value that is compared with the "maximum weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections" BAT discharge limitations (the table in ยง 435.13 and footnote 5 of the table in ยง 435.43) or the "maximum weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections" NSPS discharge limitations (the table in ยง 435.15 and footnote 5 of the table in ยง 435.45). The weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF) is calculated as the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (%BF) and is given by the following expression:
