####### Air conditioning leakage.

(h)Loss of refrigerant from your air conditioning systems may not exceed a total leakage rate of 11.0 grams per year or a percent leakage rate of 1.50 percent per year, whichever is greater. This applies for all refrigerants. Calculate the total leakage rate in g/year as specified in ยง 86.1867-12(a). Calculate the percent leakage rate as: [total leakage rate (g/yr)] &#xF7; [total refrigerant capacity (g)] x 100. Round your percent leakage rate to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent. For purpose of this requirement, "refrigerant capacity" is the total mass of refrigerant recommended by the vehicle manufacturer as representing a full charge. Where full charge is specified as a pressure, use good engineering judgment to convert the pressure and system volume to a mass.
