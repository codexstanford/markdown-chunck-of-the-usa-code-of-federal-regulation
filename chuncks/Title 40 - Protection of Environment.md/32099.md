####### Maintenance wastewater

means wastewater generated by the draining of process fluid from components in the APPU into an individual drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an individual drain system, and draining of portions of the APPU for repair. The generation of wastewater from the routine rinsing or washing of equipment in batch operation between batches is not maintenance wastewater for the purposes of this subpart.
