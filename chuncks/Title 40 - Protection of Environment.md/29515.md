####### Method 18.

(1)The procedures specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A:

(i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.

(ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or regulated organic HAP emissions shall be calculated according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.

(A) The TOC concentration (C) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using Equation 1:

(B) The regulated organic HAP or total organic HAP concentration (C) shall be computed according to Equation 1 in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section except that only the regulated or total organic HAP species shall be summed, as appropriate.
