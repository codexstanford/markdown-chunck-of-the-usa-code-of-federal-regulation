###### ยง 86.519-90 Constant volume sampler calibration.
####### PDP calibration.

(b)(1) The following calibration procedures outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the constant volume sampler pump. All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range must be performed.

(2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes (+/-1 &#xB0;C (+/-1.8 &#xB0;F)) in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.

(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.

(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure F78-5. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following data with given accuracy are required:

(5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure F78-6, set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS pump for twenty minutes. Record the calibration data.

(6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an increment of pump inlet depression (about 1.0 kPa (4 in. HO)) that will yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the data acquisition.

(7) Data analysis:

(i) The air flow rate, Q, at each test point is calculated from the flowmeter data using the manufacturers' prescribed method.

(ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, Vin mper revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and pressure.

(A) V= Pump flow, m/rev (ft/rev) at T, P.

(B) Q= Meter air flow rate in standard cubic meters per minute; standard conditions are 20 &#xB0;C, 101.3 kPa (68 &#xB0;F, 29.92 in. Hg).

(C) n = Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
