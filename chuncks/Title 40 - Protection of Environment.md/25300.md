####### Reconstruct a major source

means the replacement of components at an existing process or production unit that in and of itself emits or has that potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, whenever:

(1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable process or production unit; and

(2) It is technically and economically feasible for the reconstructed major source to meet the applicable maximum achievable control technology emission limitation for new sources established under this subpart.
