####### Transfer of property.

(8)Any person who owns or operates an approved incinerator must notify EPA at least 30 days before transferring ownership in the incinerator or the property it stands upon, or transferring the right to operate the incinerator. The transferor must also submit to EPA, at least 30 days before such transfer, a notarized affidavit signed by the transferee which states that the transferee will abide by the transferor's EPA incinerator approval. Within 30 days of receiving such notification and affidavit, EPA will issue an amended approval substituting the transferee's name for the transferor's name, or EPA may require the transferee to apply for a new incinerator approval. In the latter case, the transferee must abide by the transferor's EPA approval until EPA issues the new approval to the transferee.
