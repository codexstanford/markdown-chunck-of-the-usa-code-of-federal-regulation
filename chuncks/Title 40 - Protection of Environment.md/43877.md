(ii) For calendar year 2010 only, the following equation shall be used to determine compliance with the biomass-based diesel RVO instead of the equation in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section

(iii) The values of (ΣRINNUM)and (ΣRINNUM)may not exceed values determined by both of the following inequalities

(8) A party may only use a RIN for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(7) of this section if that RIN is a separated RIN with a K code of 2 obtained in accordance with §§ 80.1428 and 80.1429.

(9) The number of gallon-RINs associated with a given batch-RIN that can be used for compliance with the RVOs shall be calculated from the following formula:
