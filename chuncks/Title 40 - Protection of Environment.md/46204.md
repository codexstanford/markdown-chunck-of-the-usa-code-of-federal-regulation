####### Primary exhaust gas sensor malfunction criteria.

(ii)(A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration of the exhaust gas sensor output voltage, resistance, impedance, current, response rate, amplitude, offset, or other characteristic(s) (including drift or bias corrected for by secondary sensors) that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).

(B) The OBD system must detect malfunctions of the exhaust gas sensor caused by either a lack of circuit continuity or out-of-range values.

(C) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the exhaust gas sensor when a sensor failure or deterioration causes the fuel system to stop using that sensor as a feedback input (e.g., causes default or open-loop operation).

(D) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the exhaust gas sensor when the sensor output voltage, resistance, impedance, current, amplitude, activity, or other characteristics are no longer sufficient for use as an OBD system monitoring device (e.g., for catalyst monitoring).
