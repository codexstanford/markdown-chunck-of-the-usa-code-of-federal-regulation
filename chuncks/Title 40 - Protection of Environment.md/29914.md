###### Monitoring and Compliance Provisions
####### § 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Compliance with subcategory standards for liquid fuel boilers.

(16)You must comply with the mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and hydrogen chloride and chlorine standards for liquid fuel boilers under § 63.1217 as follows:

(i) You must determine the as-fired heating value of each batch of hazardous waste fired by each firing system of the boiler so that you know the mass-weighted heating value of the hazardous waste fired at all times.

(ii) If the as-fired heating value of the hazardous waste is 10,000 Btu per pound or greater, you are subject to the thermal emission concentration standards (lb/million Btu) under § 63.1217.

(iii) If the as-fired heating value of the hazardous waste is less than 10,000 Btu/lb, you are subject to the mass or volume emission concentration standards (µgm/dscm or ppmv) under § 63.1217.

(iv) If the as-fired heating value of hazardous wastes varies above and below 10,000 Btu/lb over time, you are subject to the thermal concentration standards when the heating value is 10,000 Btu/lb or greater and the mass concentration standards when the heating value is less than 10,000 Btu/lb. You may elect to comply at all times with the more stringent operating requirements that ensure compliance with both the thermal emission concentration standards and the mass or volume emission concentration standards.
