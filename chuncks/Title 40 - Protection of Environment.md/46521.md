####### 1

(iii)(A)() The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any adjustable parameter of an emission-data engine which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with ยง 86.085-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with ยง 86.085-22(e)(3)(i), prior to the performance of any tests to determine whether such engine conforms to applicable emission standards, including tests performed by the manufacturer under ยง 86.088-23(c)(2). The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use heavy-duty engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use engines.
