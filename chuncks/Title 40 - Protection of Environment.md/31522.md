####### ยง 63.1343 What standards apply to my kilns, clinker coolers, raw material dryers, and open clinker storage piles?
######## Kilns, clinker coolers, raw material dryers, raw mills, and finish mills.

(b)(1) The emissions limits for these sources are shown in Table 1.

(2) When there is an alkali bypass and/or an inline coal mill with a separate stack associated with a kiln, the combined PM emissions from the kiln and the alkali bypass stack and/or the inline coal mill stack are subject to the PM emissions limit. Existing kilns that combine the clinker cooler exhaust and/or alkali bypass and/or coal mill exhaust with the kiln exhaust and send the combined exhaust to the PM control device as a single stream may meet an alternative PM emissions limit. This limit is calculated using Equation 1 of this section:

For new kilns that combine kiln exhaust, clinker cooler gas and/or coal mill and alkali bypass exhaust, the limit is calculated using Equation 2 of this section:
