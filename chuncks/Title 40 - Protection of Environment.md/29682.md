####### Closed-vent system

means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and that is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport emissions from a process unit or piece of equipment (e.g., pumps, pressure relief devices, sampling connections, open-ended valves or lines, connectors, and instrumentation systems) back into a closed system or into any device that is capable of reducing or collecting emissions.
