####### Tubing

(2). We recommend using rigid 300 series stainless steel tubing to connect between flexible connectors. Tubing may be straight or bent to accommodate vehicle geometry. You may use "T" or "Y" fittings to join multiple connections, or you may cap or plug redundant flow paths if the engine manufacturer recommends it.
