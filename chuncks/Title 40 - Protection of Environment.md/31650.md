####### Construction

means the onsite fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected source or dedicated PAI process unit. Addition of new equipment to an affected source does not constitute construction, provided the new equipment is not a dedicated PAI process unit with the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr of combined HAP, but it may constitute reconstruction of the affected source or PAI process unit if it satisfies the definition of reconstruction in this section. At an affected source, changing raw materials processed and reconfiguring non-dedicated equipment to create a non-dedicated PAI process unit do not constitute construction.
