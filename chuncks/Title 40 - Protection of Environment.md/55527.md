1.1 This method covers the determination of phenol and certain substituted phenols. The following parameters may be determined by this method:

1.2 This is a flame ionization detector gas chromatographic (FIDGC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for derivatization, cleanup, and electron capture detector gas chromatography (ECDGC) that can be used to confirm measurements made by FIDGC. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.

1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix. The MDL listed in Table 1 for each parameter was achieved with a flame ionization detector (FID). The MDLs that were achieved when the derivatization cleanup and electron capture detector (ECD) were employed are presented in Table 2.

1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.

1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is acidified and extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to 2-propanol during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the phenols are then measured with an FID.

2.2 A preliminary sample wash under basic conditions can be employed for samples having high general organic and organic base interferences.

2.3 The method also provides for a derivatization and column chromatography cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences.The derivatives are analyzed by ECDGC.

3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.

3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 &#xB0;C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.

3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.

3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are coextracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The derivatization cleanup procedure in Section 12 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Tables 1 and 2.

3.3 The basic sample wash (Section 10.2) may cause significantly reduced recovery of phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. The analyst must recognize that results obtained under these conditions are minimum concentrations.

4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this mothod has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identifiedfor the information of analyst.

4.2 Special care should be taken in handling pentafluorobenzyl bromide, which is a lachrymator, and 18-crown-6-ether, which is highly toxic.

5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.

5.1.1 Grab sample bottle-1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.

5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)-The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 &#xB0;C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.

5.6.2 Column for derivatized phenols-1.8 m long x 2 mm ID glass, packed with 5% OV-17 on Chromosorb W-AW-DMCS (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for derivatization products of the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 11.1.

5.6.3 Detectors-Flame ionization and electron capture detectors. The FID is used when determining the parent phenols. The ECD is used when determining the derivatized phenols. Guidelines for the use of alternatve detectors are provided in Section 11.1.

6.14 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)-Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.

6.14.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in 2-propanol and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.

6.14.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 &#xB0;C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.

6.14.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.

6.15 Quality control check sample concentrate-See Section 8.2.1.

7.1 To calibrate the FIDGC for the anaylsis of underivatized phenols, establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).

7.2 External standard calibration procedure for FIDGC:

7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with 2-propanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.

7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µl, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (<10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.

7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure for FIDGC-To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.

7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with 2-propanol. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.

7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

If the RF value over the working range is a constant (<10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A/A, vs. RF.

7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than +/-15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.

7.5 To calibrate the ECDGC for the analysis of phenol derivatives, establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 2.

7.5.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with 2-propanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 2) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.

7.5.2 Each time samples are to be derivatized, simultaneously treat a 1-mL aliquot of each calibration standard as described in Section 12.

7.5.3 After derivatization, analyze 2 to 5 µL of each column eluate collected according to the method beginning in Section 12.8 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the calculated equivalent mass of underivatized phenol injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound.

7.6 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.

8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.

8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.6 and 11.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.

8.1.3 Before processing any samples the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.

8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.

8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.

8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.

8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.

8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 µg/mL in 2-propanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.

8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 100 µg/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.

8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.

8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.

8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and Xwith the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and Xfor all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual Xfalls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.

8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.

8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.

8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.

8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:

8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.

8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.

8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any, or, if none, (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 µg/L.

8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.

8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X&#x2032;) using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S&#x2032;) using the equation in Table 4, substituting X&#x2032; for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X&#x2032;/T)+/-2.44(100 S&#x2032;/T)%.

8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.

8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.

8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.

8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.

8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2sto P+ 2s. If P= 90% and s= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).

8.6. It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practicesshould be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.

9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 &#xB0;C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.Field test kits are available for this purpose.

9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.

10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.

10.2 For samples high in organic content, the analyst may solvent wash the sample at basic pH as prescribed in Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 to remove potential method interferences. Prolonged or exhaustive contact with solvent during the wash may result in low recovery of some of the phenols, notably phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. For relatively clean samples, the wash should be omitted and the extraction, beginning with Section 10.3, should be followed.

10.2.1 Adjust the pH of the sample to 12.0 or greater with sodium hydroxide solution.

10.2.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample by shaking the funnel for 1 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Discard the solvent layer. The wash can be repeated up to two additional times if significant color is being removed.

10.3 Adjust the sample to a pH of 1 to 2 with sulfuric acid.

10.4 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.

10.5 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.

10.6 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.

10.7 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.

10.8 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 &#xB0;C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.

10.9 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to 95 to 100 &#xB0;C. Remove the Synder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of 2-propanol. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube and prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of 2-propanol to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on the water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 2.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Add an additional 2 mL of 2-propanol through the top of the micro-Snyder column and resume concentrating as before. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.

10.10 Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of 2-propanol. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated at 4 &#xB0;C if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with FIDGC analysis (Section 11). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 12.

10.11 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

11.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 1. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.

11.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.

11.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.

11.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.

11.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound may be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.

11.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.

11.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, an alternative gas chromatographic procedure is required. Section 12 describes a derivatization and column chromatographic procedure which has been tested and found to be a practical means of analyzing phenols in complex extracts.

12.1 Pipet a 1.0-mL aliquot of the 2-propanol solution of standard or sample extract into a glass reaction vial. Add 1.0 mL of derivatizing reagent (Section 6.11). This amount of reagent is sufficient to derivatize a solution whose total phenolic content does not exceed 0.3 mg/mL.

12.2 Add about 3 mg of potassium carbonate to the solution and shake gently.

12.3 Cap the mixture and heat it for 4 h at 80 &#xB0;C in a hot water bath.

12.4 Remove the solution from the hot water bath and allow it to cool.

12.5 Add 10 mL of hexane to the reaction flask and shake vigorously for 1 min. Add 3.0 mL of distilled, deionized water to the reaction flask and shake for 2 min. Decant a portion of the organic layer into a concentrator tube and cap with a glass stopper.

12.6 Place 4.0 g of silica gel into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the silica gel and add about 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.

12.7 Preelute the column with 6 mL of hexane. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, pipet onto the column 2.0 mL of the hexane solution (Section 12.5) that contains the derivatized sample or standard. Elute the column with 10.0 mL of hexane and discard the eluate. Elute the column, in order, with: 10.0 mL of 15% toluene in hexane (Fraction 1); 10.0 mL of 40% toluene in hexane (Fraction 2); 10.0 mL of 75% toluene in hexane (Fraction 3); and 10.0 mL of 15% 2-propanol in toluene (Fraction 4). All elution mixtures are prepared on a volume: volume basis. Elution patterns for the phenolic derivatives are shown in Table 2. Fractions may be combined as desired, depending upon the specific phenols of interest or level of interferences.

12.8 Analyze the fractions by ECDGC. Table 2 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 2.

12.9 Calibrate the system daily with a minimum of three aliquots of calibration standards, containing each of the phenols of interest that are derivatized according to Section 7.5.

12.10 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the column fractions into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes can be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units. If the peak response exceeds the linear range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.

13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample analyzed by FIDGC (without derivatization) as indicated below.

13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.

13.2 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample analyzed by derivatization and ECDGC according to Equation 4.

13.3 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.The MDL concentrations listed in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained using reagent water.Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.

14.2 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked as six concentrations over the range 12 to 450 µg/L.Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships for a flame ionization detector are presented in Table 4.
