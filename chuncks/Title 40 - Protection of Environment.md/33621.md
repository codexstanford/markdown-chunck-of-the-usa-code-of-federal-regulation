###### Emission Limits, Work Practice Standards, and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.2450 What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
######## Design evaluation.

(h)To determine the percent reduction of a small control device that is used to comply with an emission limit specified in Table 1, 2, 3, or 5 to this subpart, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as specified in ยง 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as specified in subpart SS of this part. You must establish the value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design evaluation. For continuous process vents, the design evaluation must be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process, unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For transfer racks, the design evaluation must demonstrate that the control device achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum transfer loading rate. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in ยง 63.2445(i), this paragraph (h) does not apply to process vents in ethylene oxide service as defined in ยง 63.2550.
