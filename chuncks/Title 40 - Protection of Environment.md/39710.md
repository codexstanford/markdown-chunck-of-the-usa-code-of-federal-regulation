###### Testing and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.11935 What CEMS and CPMS requirements must I meet to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission standards for process vents?
######## e.g.,

(5) All CPMS must meet the specific parameter (minimum accuracy and calibration frequency) requirements specified in ยง 63.11940 and Table 7 to this subpart.

(6) Monitoring equipment for temperature, pressure, volumetric flow rate, mass flow rate and conductivity must be capable of measuring the appropriate parameter over a range that extends at least 20 percent beyond the normal expected operating range of values for that parameter. The data recording system associated with affected CPMS must have a resolution that is equal to or better than one-half of the required system accuracy.
