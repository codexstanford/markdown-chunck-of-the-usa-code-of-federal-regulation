This section describes a compliance approach for trailers that is consistent with the modeling for vocational vehicles and tractors described in ยง 1037.520, but is simplified consistent with the smaller number of trailer parameters that affect COemissions. Note that the calculated COemission rate,is equivalent to the value that would result from running GEM with the same input values.
