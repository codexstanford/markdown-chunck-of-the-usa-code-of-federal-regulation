###### Gas potential to release.

6.1.2.1Evaluate gas potential to release for those sources that contain gaseous hazardous substances-that is, those hazardous substances with a vapor pressure greater than or equal to 10torr.

Evaluate gas potential to release for each source based on three factors: gas containment, gas source type, and gas migration potential. Calculate the gas potential to release value as illustrated in table 6-2. Combine sources with similar characteristics into a single source in evaluating the gas potential to release factors.
