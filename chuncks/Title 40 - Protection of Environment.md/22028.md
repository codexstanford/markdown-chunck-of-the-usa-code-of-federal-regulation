(c), as determined using Equation 2H-1 or 2H-2 (as applicable). Note: For a complete traverse of a stack or duct with a diameter less than 16.5 ft (5.0 m), the distance betweenandis less than or equal toin. (12.7 mm). As discussed in section 8.2.4.2, when the distance betweenandis less than or equal toin. (12.7 mm), the velocity measured atmay be used for. Thus, it is not necessary to calculate the distance ofor to take measurements atwhen conducting a complete traverse of a stack or duct with a diameter less than 16.5 ft (5.0 m).

8.2.4 Special considerations. The following special considerations apply when the distance between traverse points is less than or equal toin. (12.7 mm).

8.2.4.1 A wall effects traverse point and the Method 1 traverse point. If the distance between a wall effects traverse point and the Method 1 traverse point is less than or equal toin. (12.7 mm), taking measurements at both points is allowed but not required or recommended; if measurements are taken at only one point, take the measurements at the point that is farther from the wall and use the velocity obtained at that point as the value for both points (see sections 8.2.3 and 9.2 for related requirements).
