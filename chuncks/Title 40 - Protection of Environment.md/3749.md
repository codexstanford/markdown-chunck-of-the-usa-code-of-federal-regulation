####### ยง 49.4176 VOC emissions control requirements for covers and closed-vent systems.
######## Covers.

(c)Each owner or operator must equip all openings on each storage vessel with a cover to ensure that all flashing, working, standing and breathing loss emissions are routed through a closed-vent system to a vapor recovery system, an enclosed combustor, or a flare.

(1) Each cover and all openings on the cover (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, pressure relief valves (PRV), and gauge wells) must form a continuous impermeable barrier over the entire surface area of the crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water in the storage vessel.

(2) Each cover opening must be secured in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid or cap) whenever material is in the unit on which the cover is installed except when it is necessary to use an opening as follows:

(i) To add fluids to, or remove fluids from the unit (this includes openings necessary to equalize or balance the internal pressure of the unit following changes in the level of the material in the unit);

(ii) To inspect or sample the fluids in the unit; or

(iii) To inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located inside the unit.

(3) Each thief hatch cover must be weighted and properly seated to ensure that flashing, working, standing, and breathing loss emissions are routed through the closed-vent system to the vapor recovery system, the enclosed combustor, or the flare under normal operating conditions.

(4) Each PRV must be set to release at a pressure that will ensure that flashing, working, standing, and breathing loss emissions are routed through the closed-vent system to the vapor recovery system, the enclosed combustor, or the flare under normal operating conditions.
