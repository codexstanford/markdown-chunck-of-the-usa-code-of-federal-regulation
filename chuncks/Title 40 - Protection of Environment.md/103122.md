####### Reference meter conversions.,[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]

(a)The calibration equations in this section use molar flow rate,, as a reference quantity. If your reference meter outputs a flow rate in a different quantity, such as standard volume rate,, actual volume rate,, or mass rate,, convert your reference meter output to a molar flow rate using the following equations, noting that while values for volume rate, mass rate, pressure, temperature, and molar mass may change during an emission test, you should ensure that they are as constant as practical for each individual set point during a flow meter calibration:
