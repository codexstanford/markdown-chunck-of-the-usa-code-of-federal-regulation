###### ยง 86.1813-17 Evaporative and refueling emission standards.
####### Refueling provisions for gaseous-fueled vehicles.

(f)The following provisions apply specifically for gaseous-fueled vehicles:

(1) Compressed natural gas vehicles must meet the requirements for fueling connection devices as specified in ANSI NGV1-2006 or CSA IR-1-15 (incorporated by reference in ยง 86.1).

(2) [Reserved]

(3) With our advance approval, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles with gauges or valves that can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during refueling (such as fixed liquid level gauges) may be tested for refueling emissions without opening such gauges or valves, as outlined in ยง 86.157-98(d)(2). We will approve your request if you can show that such gauges or valves will not be open during in-use refueling due to inaccessibility or other design features that would prevent them from opening or make this very unlikely.
