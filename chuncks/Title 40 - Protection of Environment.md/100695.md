###### ยง 1039.605 What provisions apply to engines certified under the motor-vehicle program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new nonroad engines into commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1039 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1039. See ยง 1039.610 for similar provisions that apply to engines certified to chassis-based standards for motor vehicles.
