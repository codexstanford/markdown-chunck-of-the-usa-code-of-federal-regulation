###### § 258.74 Allowable mechanisms.
####### Use of multiple mechanisms.

(k)An owner or operator may demonstrate financial assurance for closure, post-closure, and corrective action, as required by §§ 258.71, 258.72, and 258.73 by establishing more than one mechanism per facility, except that mechanisms guaranteeing performance rather than payment, may not be combined with other instruments. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) of this section, except that financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure, post-closure care, and/or corrective action may be provided by a combination of mechanisms rather than a single mechanism.

(l) The language of the mechanisms listed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) of this section must ensure that the instruments satisfy the following criteria:

(1) The financial assurance mechanisms must ensure that the amount of funds assured is sufficient to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases when needed;

(2) The financial assurance mechanisms must ensure that funds will be available in a timely fashion when needed;

(3) The financial assurance mechanisms must be obtained by the owner or operator by the effective date of these requirements or prior to the initial receipt of solid waste, whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure care, and no later that 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of § 258.58, until the owner or operator is released from the financial assurance requirements under §§ 258.71, 258.72 and 258.73.

(4) The financial assurance mechanisms must be legally valid, binding, and enforceable under State and Federal law.
