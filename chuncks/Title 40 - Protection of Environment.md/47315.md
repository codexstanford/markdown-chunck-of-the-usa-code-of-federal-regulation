####### Provided,

(d) The implementation of a production running change that causes the emission level for a particular pollutant to be either above the emission standard but below the associated upper limit for a vehicle or engine configuration for which an NCP has not been previously assessed, or below the associated upper limit for a vehicle or engine configuration for which an NCP has been previously assessed, regardless of the previous compliance level. In that event, the manufacturer will be offered a qualified certificate of conformity allowing for the introduction into commerce of the engine or vehicle configuration resulting from the running change,That:

(1) The manufacturer must submit a written report to the Administrator outlining the reason for the running change and the date the manufacturer will begin PCA testing;

(2) The manufacturer must agree:

(i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on each engine or vehicle, unless the manufacturer successfully challenges the Administrator's determination of compliance level or penalty calculation or both under ยง 86.1115-87(c);

(ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce, without invoking the procedural requirements of section 207(c) of the Clean Air Act, if the engine or vehicle configuration exceeds the upper limit as determined by the PCA;

(3) The selection of engines or vehicles for PCA testing must be initiated no later than five (5) days after the start of assembly line production of the engine or vehicle configuration resulting from the running change unless that period is extended by the Administrator; and

(4) If the compliance level is determined to be below the applicable emission standard, a previously assessed NCP will be terminated, an NCP will not be established as a result of the PCA testing, and all qualifications will be removed from the qualified certificate of conformity.

(e) The following requirements are applicable to each PCA under this subpart.

(1) The manufacturer shall make the following documents available to EPA Enforcement Officers upon request;

(i) A properly filed and current application for certification, following the format prescribed by the EPA for the appropriate model year; and

(ii) A copy of the shop manual and dealer service bulletins for the configurations being tested.

(2) Only one mechanic at a time per engine or vehicle shall make authorized checks, adjustments, or repairs, unless a particular check, adjustment, or repair requires a second mechanic as indicated in the shop manual or dealer service bulletins.

(3) A mechanic shall not perform any check, adjustment, or repair without an Enforcement Officer present unless otherwise authorized.
