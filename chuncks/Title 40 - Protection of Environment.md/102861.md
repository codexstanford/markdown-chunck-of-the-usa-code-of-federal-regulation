######## Procedure.
######### Procedure.
########## Measurement principles.

(b)Hydrocarbons and HO can positively interfere with an NDUV analyzer by causing a response similar to NO. If the NDUV analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification, simultaneously conduct such measurements to test the algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.
