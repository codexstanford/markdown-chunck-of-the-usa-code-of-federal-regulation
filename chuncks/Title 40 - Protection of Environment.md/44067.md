###### § 80.1453 What are the product transfer document (PTD) requirements for the RFS program?

(a) On each occasion when any party transfers ownership of neat and/or blended renewable fuels, except when such fuel is dispensed into motor vehicles or nonroad vehicles, engines, or equipment, or separated RINs subject to this subpart, the transferor must provide to the transferee documents that include all of the following information, as applicable:

(1) The name and address of the transferor and transferee.

(2) The transferor's and transferee's EPA company registration numbers.

(3) The volume of renewable fuel that is being transferred, if any.

(4) The date of the transfer.

(5) [Reserved]

(6) The quantity of RINs being traded.

(7) The D code of the RINs.

(8) The RIN status (Assigned or Separated).

(9) The RIN generation year.

(10) The associated reason for the sell or buy transaction (e.g., standard trade or remedial action).

(11) Additional RIN-related information, as follows:

(i) If assigned RINs are being transferred on the same PTD used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel, then the assigned RIN information shall be identified on the PTD.

(A) The identifying information for a RIN that is transferred in EMTS generically is the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(10) of this section.

(B) The identifying information for a RIN that is transferred in EMTS uniquely is the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(10) of this section, the RIN generator company ID, the RIN generator facility ID, and the batch number.

(C) The identifying information for a RIN that is generated prior to July 1, 2010, is the 38-digit code pursuant to § 80.1425, in its entirety.

(ii) If assigned RINs are being transferred on a separate PTD from that which is used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel, then the PTD which is used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel shall include all the following:

(A) The number of gallon-RINs being transferred.

(B) A unique reference to the PTD which is transferring the assigned RINs.

(C) The information specified in paragraphs (a)(11)(i)(A) through (a)(11)(i)(C) of this section, as appropriate.

(iii) If no assigned RINs are being transferred with the renewable fuel, the PTD which is used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel shall state "No assigned RINs transferred.".

(iv) If RINs have been separated from the renewable fuel or fuel blend pursuant to § 80.1429(b)(4), then all PTDs which are at any time used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel or fuel blend shall state "This volume of fuel must be used in the designated form, without further blending.".

(12) For the transfer of renewable fuel for which RINs were generated, an accurate and clear statement on the product transfer document of the fuel type from Table 1 to § 80.1426, and designation of the fuel use(s) intended by the transferor, as follows:

(i) Ethanol. "This volume of neat or blended ethanol is designated and intended for use as transportation fuel or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(ii) Biodiesel. "This volume of neat or blended biodiesel is designated and intended for use as transportation fuel, heating oil or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(iii) Renewable heating oil. "This volume of heating oil is designated and intended for use as heating oil in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(iv) Renewable diesel. "This volume of neat or blended renewable diesel is designated and intended for use as transportation fuel, heating oil or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(v) Naphtha. "This volume of neat or blended naphtha is designated and intended for use as transportation fuel or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. This naphtha may only be used as a gasoline blendstock or jet fuel. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(vi) Butanol. "This volume of neat or blended butanol is designated and intended for use as transportation fuel or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. This butanol may only be used as a gasoline blendstock or jet fuel. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(vii) Renewable fuels other than ethanol, biodiesel, heating oil, renewable diesel, naptha or butanol. "This volume of neat or blended renewable fuel is designated and intended to be used as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel in the 48 U.S. contiguous states and Hawaii. Any person exporting this fuel is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 80.1430.".

(b) Except for transfers to truck carriers, retailers, or wholesale purchaser-consumers, product codes may be used to convey the information required under paragraphs (a)(1) through (11) and (e) of this section if such codes are clearly understood by each transferee.

(c) For renewable fuel, other than ethanol, that is not registered as motor vehicle fuel under 40 CFR Part 79, the PTD which is used to transfer ownership of the renewable fuel shall state "This volume of renewable fuel may not be used as a motor vehicle fuel."

(d) For fuel oil meeting paragraph (2) of the definition of "heating oil" in § 80.1401, the PTD of the fuel oil shall state: "This volume of renewable fuel oil is designated and intended to be used to heat or cool interior spaces of homes or buildings to control ambient climate for human comfort.
