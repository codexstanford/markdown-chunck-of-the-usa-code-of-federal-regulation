(1) Calculate the Reynolds number,, for each reference molar flow rate,, using the throat diameter of the venturi,. Because the dynamic viscosity, µ, is needed to compute, you may use your own fluid viscosity model to determine µ for your calibration gas (usually air), using good engineering judgment. Alternatively, you may use the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model to approximate µ, as shown in the following sample calculation for:

Where, using the Sutherland three-coefficient viscosity model as captured in Table 4 of this section:
