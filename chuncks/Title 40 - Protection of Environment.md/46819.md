###### ยง 86.122-78 Carbon monoxide analyzer calibration.
####### Initial and periodic interference check.

(a)Prior to its introduction into service and annually thereafter the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and CO:

(1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance on the most sensitive range to be used.

(2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or zero-grade nitrogen.

(3) Bubble a mixture of 3 percent COin Nthrough water at room temperature and record analyzer response.

(4) An analyzer response of more than 1 percent of full scale for ranges above 300 ppm full scale or of more than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale will require corrective action. (Use of conditioning columns is one form of corrective action which may be taken.)
