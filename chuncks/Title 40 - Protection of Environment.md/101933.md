####### Liability.

(c)Engines and vehicles for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. This applies to engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, and all other persons as if the recreational vehicles were motor vehicles. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new recreational vehicles; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the recreational vehicle under this part 1051 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines or vehicles do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR 1068.505.
