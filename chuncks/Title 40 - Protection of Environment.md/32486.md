####### Combination of process vents from batch unit operations and process vents from continuous unit operations.

(i)If an owner or operator combines a process vent from a batch unit operation that is associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product with a process vent from a continuous unit operation that is associated with the use of a nonepoxide prior to the epoxide control technique, or prior to a nonepoxide recovery device that is after the epoxide control technique, then the provisions in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section shall apply.

(1) The process vent from the batch unit operation is not required to be included in the group determination required by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.

(2) The TRE index value of the combined stream shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and the TRE index value shall be calculated during a period when nonepoxide organic HAP emissions are being generated by the batch unit operation.
