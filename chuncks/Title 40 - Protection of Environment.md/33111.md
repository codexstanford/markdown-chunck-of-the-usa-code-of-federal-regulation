####### Semi-closed submerged arc furnace

means an electric submerged arc furnace equipped with a partially sealed cover over the furnace. This cover is equipped with openings to allow penetration of the electrodes into the furnace. Mix is introduced into the furnace around the electrode holes forming a partial seal between the electrodes and the cover. Furnace emissions generated under the cover are ducted to an emission control device. Emissions that escape the cover are collected and vented through stacks directly to the atmosphere.
