###### ยง 180.572 Bifenazate; tolerance for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of bifenazate (1-methylethyl 2-(4-methoxy[1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl]-3-yl)hydrazinecarboxylate) including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified are to be determined by measuring only the sum of bifenazate and its metabolite, diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl]-3-yl), 1-methylethyl ester, (calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of bifenazate) in or on the following food commodities:

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of bifenazate (1-methylethyl 2-(4-methoxy[1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl]-3-yl) hydrazinecarboxylate) including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified are to be determined by measuring only the sum of bifenazate and its metabolites diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl]-3-yl), 1-methylethyl ester; 1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl, 4-ol; and 1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl, 4-oxysulfonic acid (calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of bifenazate) in or on the following food commodities:
