## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter U - Air Pollution Controls
#### PART 1045 - CONTROL OF EMISSIONS FROM SPARK-IGNITION PROPULSION MARINE ENGINES AND VESSELS
##### Subpart A - Overview and Applicability
###### ยง 1045.5 Which engines are excluded from this part's requirements?
####### Large natural gas engines.

(c)Propulsion marine engines powered by natural gas with maximum engine power at or above 250 kW are deemed to be compression-ignition engines. These engines are therefore subject to all the requirements of 40 CFR part 1042 instead of this part even if they would otherwise meet the definition of "spark-ignition" in ยง 1045.801.
