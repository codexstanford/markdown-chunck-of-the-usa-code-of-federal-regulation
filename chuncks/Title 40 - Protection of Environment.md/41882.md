#### PART 72 - PERMITS REGULATION
##### Subpart A - Acid Rain Program General Provisions
###### § 72.2 Definitions.
####### Gas-fired

means:

(1) For all purposes under the Acid Rain Program, except for part 75 of this chapter, the combustion of:

(i) Natural gas or other gaseous fuel (including coal-derived gaseous fuel), for at least 90.0 percent of the unit's average annual heat input during the previous three calendar years and for at least 85.0 percent of the annual heat input in each of those calendar years; and

(ii) Any fuel, except coal or solid or liquid coal-derived fuel, for the remaining heat input, if any.

(2) For purposes of part 75 of this chapter, the combustion of:

(i) Natural gas or other gaseous fuel (including coal-derived gaseous fuel) for at least 90.0 percent of the unit's average annual heat input during the previous three calendar years and for at least 85.0 percent of the annual heat input in each of those calendar years; and

(ii) Fuel oil, for the remaining heat input, if any.

(3) For purposes of part 75 of this chapter, a unit may initially qualify as gas-fired if the designated representative demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the requirements of paragraph (2) of this definition are met, or will in the future be met, through one of the following submissions:

(i) For a unit for which a monitoring plan has not been submitted under § 75.62 of this chapter, the designated representative submits either:

(A) Fuel usage data for the unit for the three calendar years immediately preceding the date of initial submission of the monitoring plan for the unit under § 75.62; or

(B) If a unit does not have fuel usage data for one or more of the three calendar years immediately preceding the date of initial submission of the monitoring plan for the unit under § 75.62, the unit's designated fuel usage; all available fuel usage data (including the percentage of the unit's heat input derived from the combustion of gaseous fuels), beginning with the date on which the unit commenced commercial operation; and the unit's projected fuel usage.

(ii) For a unit for which a monitoring plan has already been submitted under § 75.62, that has not qualified as gas-fired under paragraph (3)(i) of this definition, and whose fuel usage changes, the designated representative submits either:

(A) Three calendar years of data following the change in the unit's fuel usage, showing that no less than 90.0 percent of the unit's average annual heat input during the previous three calendar years, and no less than 85.0 percent of the unit's annual heat input during any one of the previous three calendar years, is from the combustion of gaseous fuels and the remaining heat input is from the combustion of fuel oil; or

(B) A minimum of 720 hours of unit operating data following the change in the unit's fuel usage, showing that no less than 90.0 percent of the unit's heat input is from the combustion of gaseous fuels and the remaining heat input is from the combustion of fuel oil, and a statement that this changed pattern of fuel usage is considered permanent and is projected to continue for the foreseeable future.

(iii) If a unit qualifies as gas-fired under paragraph (3)(i) or (ii) of this definition, the unit is classified as gas-fired as of the date of the submission under such paragraph.

(4) For purposes of part 75 of this chapter, a unit that initially qualifies as gas-fired under paragraph (3)(i) or (ii) of this definition must meet the criteria in paragraph (2) of this definition each year in order to continue to qualify as gas-fired. If such a unit combusts only gaseous fuel and fuel oil but fails to meet such criteria for a given year, the unit no longer qualifies as gas-fired starting January 1 of the year after the first year for which the criteria are not met. If such a unit combusts fuel other than gaseous fuel or fuel oil and fails to meet such criteria in a given year, the unit no longer qualifies as gas-fired starting the day after the first day for which the criteria are not met. If a unit failing to meet the criteria in paragraph (2) of this definition initially qualified as a gas-fired unit under paragraph (3) of this definition, the unit may qualify as a gas-fired unit for a subsequent year only if the designated representative submits the data specified in paragraph (3)(ii)(A) of this definition.
