###### Appendix B to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63 - -HCl and HF Monitoring Provisions
####### i.e.,

10.1.7.2 The hourly HCl and/or HF emissions rate (lb/MMBtu, or lb/MWh, as applicable), for each hour in which valid values of HCl or HF concentration and all other required parameters (stack gas volumetric flow rate, diluent gas concentration, electrical load, and moisture data, as applicable) are obtained for the hour. Round off the emission rate to the same precision as the standard (with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation). Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged;

10.1.7.3 An identification code for the formula used to derive the hourly HCl or HF emission rate from HCl or HF concentration, flow rate, electrical load, diluent gas concentration, and moisture data (as applicable); and

10.1.7.4 A code indicating that the HCl or HF emission rate was not calculated for the hour, if valid data for HCl or HF concentration and/or any of the other necessary parameters are not obtained for the hour. For the purposes of this appendix, the substitute data values required under part 75 of this chapter for diluent gas concentration, stack gas flow rate and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.

10.1.7.5 If applicable, a code to indicate that the default electrical load (as defined in ยง 63.10042) was used to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate.

10.1.7.6 If applicable, a code to indicate that the diluent cap (as defined in ยง 63.10042) was used to calculate the HCl or HF emission rate.
