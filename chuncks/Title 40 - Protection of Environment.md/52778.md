(1) High heat values of black liquor must be determined no less than annually using T684 om-06 Gross Heating Value of Black Liquor, TAPPI (incorporated by reference,ยง 98.7). If measurements are performed more frequently than annually, then the high heat value used in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative measurements made during the year.

(2) The annual mass of spent liquor solids must be determined using either of the methods specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) Measure the mass of spent liquor solids annually (or more frequently) using T-650 om-05 Solids Content of Black Liquor, TAPPI (incorporated by reference in ยง 98.7). If measurements are performed more frequently than annually, then the mass of spent liquor solids used in Equation AA-1 of this subpart must be based on the average of the representative measurements made during the year.

(ii) Determine the annual mass of spent liquor solids based on records of measurements made with an online measurement system that determines the mass of spent liquor solids fired in a chemical recovery furnace or chemical recovery combustion unit.
