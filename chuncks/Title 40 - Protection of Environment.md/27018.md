####### Maintenance allowance for loading berths.

(6)The owner or operator of a source subject to paragraph (b)(2), (3) or (4), may apply for approval to the Administrator for a maintenance allowance for loading berths based on a percent of annual throughput or annual marine tank vessel loading operation time for commodities not exempted in ยง 63.560(d). The owner or operator shall maintain records for all maintenance performed on the air pollution control equipment. The Administrator will consider the following in approving the maintenance allowance:

(i) The owner or operator expects to be in violation of the emissions standards due to maintenance;

(ii) Due to conditions beyond the reasonable control of the owner or operator, compliance with the emissions standards during maintenance would result in unreasonable economic hardship;

(iii) The economic hardship cannot be justified by the resulting air quality benefit;

(iv) The owner or operator has given due consideration to curtailing marine vessel loading operations during maintenance;

(v) During the maintenance allowance, the owner or operator will endeavor to reduce emissions from other loading berths that are controlled as well as from the loading berth the owner or operator is seeking the maintenance allowance; and

(vi) During the maintenance allowance, the owner or operator will monitor and report emissions from the loading berth to which the maintenance allowance applies.
