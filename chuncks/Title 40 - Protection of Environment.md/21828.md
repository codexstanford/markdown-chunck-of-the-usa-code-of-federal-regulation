###### Monitoring and Compliance Determination Procedures
####### § 60.5535 How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?
######## e.g.,

(2) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on a heat-input basis (lb CO/MMBtu) and your affected source uses non-uniform heating value fuels as delineated under § 60.5520(d), you must determine the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period in accordance with one of the following procedures:

(i) Appendix D to part 75 of this chapter;

(ii) The procedures for monitoring heat input under § 60.107a(d);

(iii) If you monitor COemissions in accordance with the Tier 3 methodology under § 98.33(a)(3) of this chapter, you may convert your COemissions to heat input using the appropriate emission factor in table C-1 of part 98 of this chapter. If your fuel is not listed in table C-1, you must determine a fuel-specific carbon-based F-factor (F) in accordance with section 12.3.2 of EPA Method 19 of appendix A-7 to this part, and you must convert your COemissions to heat input using Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter.

(e) Consistent with § 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly gross or net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load contributed by each EGU. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly gross or net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU.

(f) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs that implement the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack and are subject to the same emissions standard in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you may monitor the hourly COmass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If you choose this option, the hourly gross or net energy output (electric, thermal, and/or mechanical, as applicable) must be the sum of the hourly loads for the individual affected EGUs and you must express the operating time as "stack operating hours" (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter). If you attain compliance with the applicable emissions standard in § 60.5520 at the common stack, each affected EGU sharing the stack is in compliance.

(g) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520 if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU that implements the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), you must monitor the hourly COmass emissions and the "stack operating time" (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) at each stack or duct separately. In this case, you must determine compliance with the applicable emissions standard in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart by summing the COmass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU.
