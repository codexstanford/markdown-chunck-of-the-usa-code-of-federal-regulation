####### e.g.,

(E) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of net heating values expected for the flare gas stream/system going to the affected flare ("the samples are representative of typical operating conditions of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare" or "the samples are representative of conditions expected to yield the lowest net heating value of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare").

(F) The net heating value to be used for all flows of the flare vent gas from the flare gas stream/system covered in the application. A single net heating value must be assigned to the flare vent gas either by selecting the lowest net heating value measured in the sampling program or by determining the 95th percent confidence interval on the mean value of all samples collected using the t-distribution statistic (which is 1.943 for 7 grab samples or 1.771 for 14 grab samples).

(ii) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section.
