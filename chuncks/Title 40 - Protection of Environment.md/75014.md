7.2.5.5 Transfer (weigh) a 30-g aliquot from Jar 1 to a labeled centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the aliquot for a minimum of 15 min at approximately 15,000 rpm, in order to obtain a solids free supernate. Weigh 0.5 g of the supernate directly into a tared and appropriately labeled GC straight vial. Spike the 0.5-g supernate with 500 ÂµL of the 0.01g/mL 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene internal standard solution (Section 7.2.3 of this appendix), cap with a Teflon lined crimp cap, and vortex for ca. 10 sec.

7.2.5.6 Repeat step 7.2.5.5 except use an aliquot from Jar 2.

7.2.5.7 Repeat step 7.2.5.5 except use an aliquot from Jar 3.

7.2.5.8 Repeat step 7.2.5.5 except use an aliquot from Jar 4.

7.2.5.9 These 4 crude/oil drilling fluid calibration standards are now used for qualitative and quantitative GC/MS analysis.
