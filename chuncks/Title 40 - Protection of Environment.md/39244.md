######## Engineering assessment

means, but is not limited to, the following:

(1) Previous test results provided the tests are representative of current operating practices at the process unit.

(2) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process under representative operating conditions.

(3) Maximum flow rate, TOC emission rate, organic HAP emission rate, metal HAP emission rate, or net heating value limit specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent.

(4) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to:

(i) Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to estimate maximum organic HAP or metal HAP concentrations;

(ii) Estimation of maximum flow rate based on physical equipment design such as pump or blower capacities;

(iii) Estimation of TOC, organic HAP, or metal HAP concentrations based on saturation conditions; or

(iv) Estimation of maximum expected net heating value based on the vent stream concentration of each organic compound or, alternatively, as if all TOC in the vent stream were the compound with the highest heating value.

(5) All data, assumptions, and procedures used in the engineering assessment shall be documented.
