(ii) The aqueous phase should be sampled by the following procedure to minimize the risk of including traces of the-octanol: A glass syringe with a removable needle should be used to sample the water phase. The syringe should initially be partially filled with air. Air should be gently expelled while inserting the needle through the-octanol layer. An adequate volume of aqueous phase is withdrawn into the syringe. The syringe is quickly removed from the solution and the needle detached. The contents of the syringe may then be used as the aqueous sample.

(iii) The concentration in the two-separated phases should preferably be determined by a substance-specific method. Examples of physical-chemical determinations which may be appropriate are:

(A) Photometric methods.

(B) Gas chromatography.

(C) HPLC.

(D) Back-extraction of the aqueous phase and subsequent gas chromatography.
