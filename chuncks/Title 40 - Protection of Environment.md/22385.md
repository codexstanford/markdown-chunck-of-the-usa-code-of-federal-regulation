###### 12.9 Recovery of Labeled Compound Standards.

Use Equation 23-9 to determine the recovery of pre-sampling adsorbent standard and the pre-extraction filter recovery standard. Use Equation 23-10 to determine the recovery of the pre-extraction standard. The recovery performance criteria for these standards are in Sections 13.14, 13.15, and 13.16 of this method.

Recovery may be calculated based on mass instead of concentration, as needed.
