####### Pressure groups

as applicable to each sub-basin are defined as follows: Less than or equal to 25 psig; greater than 25 psig and less than or equal to 60 psig; greater than 60 psig and less than or equal to 110 psig; greater than 110 psig and less than or equal to 200 psig; and greater than 200 psig. The pressure in the context of pressure groups is either the well shut-in pressure; well casing pressure; or you may use the casing-to-tubing pressure of one well from the same sub-basin multiplied by the tubing pressure for each well in the sub-basin.
