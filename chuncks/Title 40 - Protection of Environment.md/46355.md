####### Optional procedures for determining exhaust opacity.

(f)(1) The provisions of subpart I of this part apply to tests which are performed by the Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.

(2) Measurement procedures, other than those described in subpart I of this part, may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer satisfies the requirements of ยง 86.007-23(f).

(3) When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement procedure, it has the responsibility to determine whether the results obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I of this part. Consequently, the Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove any alternative opacity measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements for subpart I of this part.

(4) If a confirmatory test is performed and the results indicate there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately correlate with data obtained in accordance with the procedures described in subpart I of this part, EPA may require that all certificates of conformity not already issued be based on data obtained from procedures described in subpart I of this part.
