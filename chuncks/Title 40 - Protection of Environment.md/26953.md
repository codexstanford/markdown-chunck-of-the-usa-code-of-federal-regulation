###### § 63.550 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
####### i.e.,

(11) Records of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (process equipment) or the air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment.

(12) Records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.543(k), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.

(13) Records of any periods of startup or shutdown of a furnace and actions taken to minimize emissions during that period in accordance with § 63.543(l).

(d) You must comply with all of the reporting requirements specified in § 63.10 of the General Provisions that are referenced in Table 1 to this subpart.

(1) You must submit reports no less frequent than specified under § 63.10(e)(3) of the General Provisions.

(2) Once a source reports a violation of the standard or excess emissions, you must follow the reporting format required under § 63.10(e)(3) until a request to reduce reporting frequency is approved by the Administrator.

(e) In addition to the information required under the applicable sections of § 63.10, you must include in the reports required under paragraph (d) of this section the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (14) of this section.

(1) Records of the concentration of lead in each process vent, and records of the rolling 12-month flow-weighted average concentration of lead compounds in vent gases calculated monthly as required in § 63.543(a), except during the first year when the concentration is calculated using the method described in § 63.543(a)(2).

(2) Records of the concentration of total hydrocarbon and dioxins and furans in each process vent that has established limits for total hydrocarbon and dioxins and furans as required in § 63.543(c).

(3) Records of all periods when monitoring using a CEMS for lead or total hydrocarbon was not in compliance with applicable limits.

(4) Records of all alarms from the bag leak detection system specified in § 63.548.

(5) A description of the procedures taken following each bag leak detection system alarm pursuant to § 63.548(f)(1) and (2).

(6) A summary of the records maintained as part of the practices described in the standard operating procedures manual for baghouses required under § 63.548(a), including an explanation of the periods when the procedures were not followed and the corrective actions taken.

(7) An identification of the periods when the pressure drop and water flow rate of wet scrubbers used to control process fugitive sources dropped below the levels established in § 63.548(i), and an explanation of the corrective actions taken.

(8) Records of the temperature monitor output, in 3-hour block averages, for those periods when the temperature monitored pursuant to § 63.548(j) fell below the level established in § 63.548(j)(4).

(9) Certification that the plastic separation process for battery breakers required in § 63.543(m) was operated at all times the battery breaker was in service.

(10) Records of 15-minute periods when the pressure was not maintained as required in § 63.544(c) or power was lost to the continuous pressure monitoring system as required in § 63.548(k). Records of which wall is chosen as the windward wall must be included in the records required by § 63.10(c) if a total enclosure located within a larger structure is not impacted by ambient wind.

(11) If a malfunction occurred during the reporting period, the report must include the number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction that occurred during the reporting period and caused or may have caused any applicable emissions limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of actions taken during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.543(k), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.

(12) A summary of the fugitive dust control measures performed during the required reporting period, including an explanation of the periods when the procedures outlined in the standard operating procedures manual pursuant to § 63.545(a) were not followed and the corrective actions taken. The reports must not contain copies of the daily records required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the standard operating procedures manuals required under § 63.545(a).

(13) Records of any periods of startup or shutdown of a furnace including an explanation of the periods when the procedures required in § 63.543(l) were not followed and the corrective actions taken.

(14) You must submit records pursuant to paragraphs (e)(14)(i) through (iii) of this section.
