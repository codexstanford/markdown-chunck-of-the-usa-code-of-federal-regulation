(h)The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) submitted 8-hour ozone maintenance plans for the areas of Beauregard, Grant, and St. Mary Parishes on August 23, 2006, August 23, 2006, and October 10, 2006, respectively. The three areas are designated unclassifiable/attainment for the 8-hour ozone standard. EPA determined these requests for Beauregard, Grant, and St. Mary Parishes were complete on October 9, 2006, October 9, 2006, and November 30, 2006, respectively. The maintenance plans meet the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, and are consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 8-hour ozone maintenance plans for the areas of Beauregard, Grant, and St. Mary parishes on November 6, 2007.
