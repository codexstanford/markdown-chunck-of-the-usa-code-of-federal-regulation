####### Retrofit maintenance.

(d)Maintenance of the retrofit device will normally not be performed during the accumulation of durability mileage of 15,000 miles. However, certain retrofit devices may require periodic maintenance that is directly related to device function. An example is the periodic addition of fluid to the reservoir of a vapor injector. The Administrator will determine whether periodic maintenance will be allowed, based on his review of available information including the device manufacturer's maintenance instructions to the consumer.

(e) A log of all maintenance shall be kept for every vehicle. These logs will be summarized in the final report by the Administrator.
