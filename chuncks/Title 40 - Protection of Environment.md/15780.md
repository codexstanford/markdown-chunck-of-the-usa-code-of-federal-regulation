####### ยง 53.55 Test for effect of variations in power line voltage and ambient temperature.
######## Flow rate coefficient of variation measurement accuracy.

(4)(i) Using the flow rate coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate test sampler (%CV), determine the accuracy of the reported coefficient of variation as:

(ii) To successfully pass this test, the absolute difference calculated in Equation 15 of this paragraph (g)(4) must not exceed 0.3 (CV%) for each test run.
