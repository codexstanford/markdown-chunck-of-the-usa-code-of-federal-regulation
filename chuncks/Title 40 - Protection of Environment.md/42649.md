####### Volumetric flow and NO,emission rate or NO,concentration data (load ranges or operational bins used).

(c)The procedures in this paragraph apply to affected units for which load-based ranges or non-load-based operational bins, as defined, respectively, in sections 2 and 3 of appendix C to this part are used to provide substitute NOand flow rate data. For each hour of missing volumetric flow rate data, NOemission rate data, or NOconcentration data used to determine NOmass emissions:

(1) Whenever prior quality-assured data exist in the load range (or operational bin) corresponding to the operating load (or operating conditions) at the time of the missing data period, the owner or operator shall substitute, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, for each hour of missing data, the arithmetic average of all of the prior quality-assured hourly flow rates, NOemission rates, or NOconcentrations in the corresponding load range (or operational bin) as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part. When non-load-based operational bins are used, if essential operating or parametric data are unavailable for any hour in the missing data period, such that the operational bin cannot be determined, the owner or operator shall, for that hour, substitute (as applicable) the maximum potential flow rate as specified in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part or the maximum potential NOemission rate or the maximum potential NOconcentration as specified in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part.

(2) This paragraph (c)(2) does not apply to non-load-based units using operational bins. Whenever no prior quality-assured flow or NOemission rate or NOconcentration data exist for the corresponding load range, the owner or operator shall substitute, for each hour of missing data, the average hourly flow rate or the average hourly NOemission rate or NOconcentration at the next higher level load range for which quality-assured data are available.

(3) Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate or NOemission rate or NOconcentration data exist for the corresponding load range, or any higher load range (or for non-load-based units using operational bins, when no prior quality-assured data exist in the corresponding operational bin), the owner or operator shall, as applicable, substitute, for each hour of missing data, the maximum potential flow rate as specified in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part or shall substitute the maximum potential NOemission rate or the maximum potential NOconcentration, as specified in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. Alternatively, where a unit with add-on NOemission controls can demonstrate that the controls are operating properly during the hour, as provided in ยง 75.34(d), the owner or operator may substitute, as applicable, the maximum controlled NOemission rate (MCR) or the maximum expected NOconcentration (MEC).
