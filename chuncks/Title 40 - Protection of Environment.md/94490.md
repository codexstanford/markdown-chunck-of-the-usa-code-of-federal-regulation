The double wash/rinse procedure includes two washing steps and two rinsing steps. The two washing and rinsing steps are slightly different depending on whether a contaminated surface was relatively clean before the spill (see ยง 761.372), or whether the surface was coated or covered with dust, dirt, grime, grease or another absorbent material (see ยง 761.375).
