####### Data stream information

(D)means information (i.e., messages and parameters) originated within the engine by a module or intelligent sensors (i.e., a sensor that contains and is controlled by its own module) and transmitted between a network of modules and/or intelligent sensors connected in parallel with either one or more communication wires. The information is broadcast over the communication wires for use by the OBD system to gather information on emissions-related components or systems and from other engine modules that may impact emissions. For the purposes of this section, data stream information does not include engine calibration related information, or any data stream information from systems or modules that do not impact emissions.
