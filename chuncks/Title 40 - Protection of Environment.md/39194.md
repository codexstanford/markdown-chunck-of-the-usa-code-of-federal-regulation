####### ยง 63.11496 What are the standards and compliance requirements for process vents?
######## Combined streams.

(c)If you combine organic HAP emissions from batch process vents and continuous process vents, you must comply with the more stringent standard in Table 2 or Table 3 to this subpart that applies to any portion of the combined stream, or you must comply with Table 2 for the batch process vents and Table 3 for the continuous process vents. The TRE index value for continuous process vents and the annual emissions from batch process vents shall be determined for the individual streams before they are combined, and prior to any control (e.g., by subtracting any emission contributions from storage tanks, continuous process vents or batch process vents, as applicable), in order to determine the most stringent applicable requirements.
