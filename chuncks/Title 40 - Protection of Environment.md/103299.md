###### ยง 1065.701 General requirements for test fuels.
####### Fuel specifications.

(d)Specifications in this section apply as follows:

(1) Measure and calculate values as described in the appropriate reference procedure. Record and report final values expressed to at least the same number of decimal places as the applicable limit value. The right-most digit for each limit value is significant unless specified otherwise. For example, for a specified distillation temperature of 60 &#xB0;C, determine the test fuel's value to at least the nearest whole number.

(2) The fuel parameters specified in this subpart depend on measurement procedures that are incorporated by reference. For any of these procedures, you may instead rely upon the procedures identified in 40 CFR part 1090 for measuring the same parameter. For example, we may identify different reference procedures for measuring gasoline parameters in 40 CFR 1090.1360.

(e) Two-stroke fuel/oil mixing. For two-stroke engines, use a fuel/oil mixture meeting the manufacturer's specifications.
