5.1.4The Hg CEMS is considered to be out-of-control, and data from the CEMS may not be reported as quality-assured, when any one of the acceptance criteria for the required QA tests in Table A-2 is not met. The CEMS is also considered to be out-of-control when a required QA test is not performed on schedule or within an allotted grace period. To end an out-of-control period, the QA test that was either failed or not done on time must be performed and passed. Out-of-control periods are counted as hours of monitoring system downtime.
