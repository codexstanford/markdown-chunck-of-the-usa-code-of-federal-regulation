###### Model Rule - Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
####### ยง 60.2675 What operating limits must I meet and by when?
######## e.g.,

(g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate of each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).

(h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to ten percent opacity (1-hour block average).

(i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate continuing compliance, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:
