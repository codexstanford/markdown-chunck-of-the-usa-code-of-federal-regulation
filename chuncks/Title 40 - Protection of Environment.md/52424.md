###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Calculation Method 1.

(1)If you operate and maintain a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) that has both a COconcentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor, you must calculate COemissions under this subpart by following the Tier 4 Calculation Method and all associated calculation, quality assurance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). Alternatively, you may follow the manufacturer's instructions or industry standard practice. If a COconcentration monitor and volumetric flow rate monitor are not available, you may elect to install a COconcentration monitor and a volumetric flow rate monitor that comply with all of the requirements specified for the Tier 4 Calculation Method in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources). The calculation and reporting of CHand NO emissions is not required as part of the Tier 4 requirements for AGR units.
