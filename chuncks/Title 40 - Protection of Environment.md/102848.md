########## System requirements.

(c)A CLD analyzer must have a combined HO and COquench of +/-2% or less, though we strongly recommend a quench of +/-1% or less. Combined quench is the sum of the COquench determined as described in paragraph (d) of this section, plus the HO quench determined in paragraph (e) of this section.
