(e)-(1)Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS, an area with an approved 1-hour maintenance plan under section 175A of the CAA may modify the maintenance plan: To remove the obligation to submit a maintenance plan for the 1-hour NAAQS 8 years after approval of the initial 1-hour maintenance plan; and to remove the obligation to implement contingency measures upon a violation of the 1-hour NAAQS. However, such requirements will remain enforceable as part of the approved SIP until such time as EPA approves a SIP revision removing such obligations. The EPA shall not approve a SIP revision requesting these modifications until the State submits and EPA approves an attainment demonstration for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or a maintenance SIP for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS. Any revision to such SIP must meet the requirements of section 110(l) and 193 of the CAA.
