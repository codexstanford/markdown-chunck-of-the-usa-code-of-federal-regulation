###### ยง 1039.102 What exhaust emission standards and phase-in allowances apply for my engines in model year 2014 and earlier?
####### Banked credits and alternate phase-in for 56-130 kW engines.

(d)For engines in the 56-130 kW power category, you may use only one of the following additional provisions:

(1) For model years 2012 through 2014, you may use banked NO+ NMHC credits from any Tier 2 engine at or above 37 kW certified under the standards identified in appendix I of this part to meet the NOphase-in standards or the NO+ NMHC phase-out standards under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, subject to the additional ABT provisions in ยง 1039.740.

(2) Instead of meeting the phase-in requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you may certify engine families representing at least 25 percent of your U.S.-directed production volume for each model year from 2012 through 2014 to the applicable phase-in standards in Tables 4 and 5 of this section, except as allowed by paragraph (c)(3) or (e) of this section. Any engines not certified to the phase-in standards must be certified to the corresponding phase-out standards. Engines certified under this paragraph (d)(2) may generate NOemission credits only for averaging within the same power category during the same model year. For engines certified under this paragraph (d)(2), the 2014 model year may not extend beyond December 30, 2014.
