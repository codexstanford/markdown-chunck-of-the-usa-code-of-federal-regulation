() A continuous parameter monitoring system to measure and record the average carbon bed temperature for the duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle and to measure the actual carbon bed temperature after regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing the cooling cycle. The temperature monitoring device shall have a minimum accuracy of +/-2 percent of the temperature being monitored in &#xB0;C, or +/-2.5 &#xB0;C, whichever value is greater.

(G) For a nonregenerative-type carbon adsorption system, the owner or operator shall monitor the design carbon replacement interval established using a performance test performed in accordance with ยง 63.1282(d)(3) and shall be based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.

(H) For a control device whose model is tested under ยง 63.1282(g):
