(i)(A) On January 13, 1984, Indiana issued to Richmond State Hospital an amendment to operating permit, 89-04-85-0153, which revised its TSP emission limitations for the four boilers to 0.60 lbs/MMBTU with an annual total limit of 452 tons/yr.

(55) On January 30, 1985, Indiana submitted revised VOC regulations 325 IAC 8-1.1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4 and 8-5 to satisfy certain conditions of USEPA's approval. Those regulations amended those approved at (c)(33) and (c)(34). In addition, the applicability of the regulations was extended to cover St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties. USEPA is taking no action on changes to 325 IAC 8-1.1-2(f), Methods of Compliance, and the repeal of 325 IAC 8-5-6, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning, because these exempt the compound perchloroethylene from control without the State justifying that such exemption is consistent with the Part D reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements.
