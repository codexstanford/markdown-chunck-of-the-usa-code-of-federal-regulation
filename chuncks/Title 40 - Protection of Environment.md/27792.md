####### Application equipment

(f). Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, each owner or operator of a new or existing primer, topcoat (including self-priming topcoat), or specialty coating application operation subject to this subpart in which any of the coatings contain organic HAP or VOC shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.

(1) All spray applied primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), and specialty coatings shall be applied using one or more of the spray application techniques specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(v) of this section.

(i) High volume low pressure (HVLP) spraying;

(ii) Electrostatic spray application;

(iii) Airless spray application;

(iv) Air-assisted airless spray application; or

(v) Any other coating spray application methods that achieve emission reductions or a transfer efficiency equivalent to or better than HVLP spray, electrostatic spray, airless spray, or air-assisted airless spray application methods as determined according to the requirements in ยง 63.750(i).

(2) All coating spray application devices used to apply primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), or specialty coatings shall be operated according to company procedures, local specified operating procedures, and/or the manufacturer's specifications, whichever is most stringent, at all times. Spray application equipment modified by the facility shall maintain a transfer efficiency equivalent to HVLP spray, electrostatic spray, airless spray, or air-assisted airless spray application techniques.

(3) The following situations are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section:

(i) Any situation that normally requires an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces;

(ii) The application of coatings that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns;

(iii) The application of coatings that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.) and that the permitting agency has determined cannot be applied by any of the application methods specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section;
