####### Running loss emissions

means unburned fuel vapor that escapes from the fuel system to the ambient atmosphere while the engine is operating, excluding permeation emissions and diurnal emissions. Running loss emissions generally result from fuel-temperature increases caused by heat released from in-tank fuel pumps, fuel recirculation, or proximity to heat sources such as the engine or exhaust components.
