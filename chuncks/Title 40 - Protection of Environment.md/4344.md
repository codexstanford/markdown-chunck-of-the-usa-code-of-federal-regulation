###### Sulfur Dioxide Concentration.

12.3Calculate and report the concentration of each sample as follows:

12.4 Control Standards. Calculate the analyzed micrograms of SOin each control standard as follows:

The difference between the true and analyzed values of the control standards must not be greater than 1 µg. If the difference is greater than 1 µg, the source of the discrepancy must be identified and corrected.

12.5 Conversion of µg/mto ppm (v/v). If desired, the concentration of sulfur dioxide at reference conditions can be converted to ppm SO(v/v) as follows:

13.0 The TCM absorbing solution and any reagents containing mercury compounds must be treated and disposed of by one of the methods discussed below. Both methods remove greater than 99.99 percent of the mercury.
