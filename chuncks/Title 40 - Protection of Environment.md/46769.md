####### Component description, CFV-CVS.

(c)The CFV-CVS sample system, Figure B94-4, consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, a cyclone particulate separator, unheated sampling venturies for the bag samples, and for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol-fueled vehicles, samples lines heated to a temperature that is more than 5 &#xB0;F (3 &#xB0;C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C) for the methanol and formaldehyde samples from methanol fueled vehicles (heating of the sample lines may be omitted provided, the methanol and formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to the probes thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and resulting condensation in the sample lines), a critical flow venturi, and assorted valves, and pressure and temperature sensors. The CFV sample system shall conform to the following requirements:

(1) Static pressure variations at the tailpipe(s) of the vehicle shall remain within +/-5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the static pressure variations measured during a dynamometer driving cycle with no connection to the tailpipe(s). (Sampling systems capable of maintaining the static pressure to within +/-1 inch of water (0.25 kPa) will be used by the Administrator if a written request substantiates the need for this closer tolerance.)

(2) The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of +/-2 &#xB0;F (1.1 &#xB0;C) and a response time of 0.100 seconds to 62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in hot silicone oil).

(3) The pressure measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of +/-1.6 inches of water (0.4 kPa).

(4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to completely eliminate water condensation in the dilution and sampling systems. (300 to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 m/s) is sufficient for most petroleum-fueled vehicles. Higher flow rates are required for methanol-fueled vehicles and may be required for natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in "Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels," EPA 460/3-83-009.) Dehumidifying the dilution air before entering the CVS is allowed. Heating the dilution air is also allowed, provided:

(i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C).

(ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated when heated dilution air is used.)

(iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.

(5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected for the determination of methanol and formaldehyde background (methanol-fueled vehicles).

(6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the CVS. The systems shall also comply with the following requirements that apply to the design of the systems, not to individual tests.

(i) The methanol system shall be designed such that, if a test vehicle emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all applicable standards) during the first phase of the test, the measured concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer. Sampling systems for all phases shall be identical.

(ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that, if a test vehicle emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty percent of the maximum allowable level of NMHCE (i.e., 0.05 g/mi for a 0.25 g/mi NMHCE standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, during the first phase of the test, the concentration of formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the primary impinger, or solution resulting from the extraction of the DNPH cartridge, shall exceed either 2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the HPLC analyzer. Sampling systems for all phases shall be identical.

(iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary impinger. This requirement does not apply to dilution air samples, since they do not require secondary impingers, or to samples in which the concentrations approach the limit of detection.
