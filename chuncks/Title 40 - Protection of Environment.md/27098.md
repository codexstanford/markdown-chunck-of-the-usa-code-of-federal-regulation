###### ยง 63.565 Test methods and procedures.
####### Pressure/vacuum settings of marine tank vessel's vapor collection equipment.

(b)For the purpose of determining compliance with ยง 63.563(a)(3), the following procedures shall be used:

(1) Calibrate and install a pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument) capable of measuring up to the maximum relief set pressure of the pressure-vacuum vents;

(2) Connect the pressure measurement device to a pressure tap in the terminal's vapor collection system, located as close as possible to the connection with the marine tank vessel; and

(3) During the performance test required in ยง 63.563(b)(1), record the pressure every 5 minutes while a marine tank vessel is being loaded and record the highest instantaneous pressure and vacuum that occurs during each loading cycle.
