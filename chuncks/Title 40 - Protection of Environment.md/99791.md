(iii) For steady-state engine operating points that cannot be achieved and the operator demand stabilizes at maximum and the speed setpoint is at or above 90% ofeven with maximum operator demand, program the dynamometer to control torque and let the engine govern speed (see 40 CFR 1065.512(b)(1)). The specified speed tolerance does not apply for the test interval.

(iv) For the steady-state engine operating points at the minimum speed setpoint and maximum torque setpoint, you may program the dynamometer to control speed and let the engine govern torque. The specified torque tolerance does not apply for this test interval if operator demand stabilizes at its maximum or minimum limit.

(4) Record measurements using direct and/or indirect measurement of fuel flow as follows:
