(3) For a State that complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by imposing control measures on only non-EGUs, the amount of the Annual Non-EGU NOReduction Requirement, in tons of NOper year, shall be determined, for the State for 2009 and thereafter, by subtracting the amount of the State's Annual EGU NOBudget for the appropriate year, specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section from the amount of the State's NObaseline EGU emissions inventory projected for the appropriate year, specified in Table 5 of "Regional and State SOand NOBudgets", March 2005 (available at).

(4)(i) Notwithstanding the State's obligation to comply with paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, the State's SIP revision may allow sources required by the revision to implement control measures to demonstrate compliance using credit issued from the State's compliance supplement pool, as set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The State-by-State amounts of the compliance supplement pool are as follows:

(iii) The SIP revision may provide for the distribution of credits from the compliance supplement pool to sources that are required to implement control measures using one or both of the following two mechanisms:

(A) The State may issue credit from compliance supplement pool to sources that are required by the SIP revision to implement NOemission control measures and that implement NOemission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not necessary to comply with any State or federal emissions limitation applicable at any time during such years. Such a source may be issued one credit from the compliance supplement pool for each ton of such emission reductions in 2007 and 2008.
