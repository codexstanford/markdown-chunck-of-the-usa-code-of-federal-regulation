(2)(i) During the period beginning February 1, 2022 and ending February 28, 2022, the designated representative for a source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(v) of this chapter (or Indian country within the borders of such a State) may request that the Administrator allocate additional CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to the source pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. Any such request shall be submitted to the Administrator electronically at the email address

(ii) For each source covered by a request under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, as soon as practicable on or after March 1, 2022, the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance account, on a first-in, first-out basis in the order set forth in § 97.824(c)(2)(i) and (ii), the maximum number of sets of 18 CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 available in the compliance account. The Administrator will then allocate to the source one CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance for the control period in 2021 for each set of 18 CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances deducted. The Administrator will record the allocations and deductions under this paragraph in the source's compliance account.

(3) After the Administrator has carried out the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, upon any determination that would otherwise result in the initial recordation of a given number of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances in the compliance account for a source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(v) of this chapter (or Indian country within the borders of such a State), the Administrator will not record such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances but instead will allocate and record in such account an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of such given number of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(8) or (9) of this chapter, CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances may be used to satisfy requirements to hold CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances under this subpart as follows, provided that nothing in this paragraph alters the time as of which any such allowance holding requirement must be met or limits any consequence of a failure to timely meet any such allowance holding requirement:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, after the Administrator has carried out the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 source in a State listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter (or Indian country within the borders of such a State) may satisfy a requirement to hold a given number of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances for the control period in a year from 2017 through 2020 by holding instead, in a general account established for this sole purpose, an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 (or any later control period for which the allowance transfer deadline defined in § 97.1002 has passed) computed as the quotient, rounded up to the nearest allowance, of such given number of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

(2) CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances may not be used to satisfy requirements to surrender CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances under § 97.811(d).
