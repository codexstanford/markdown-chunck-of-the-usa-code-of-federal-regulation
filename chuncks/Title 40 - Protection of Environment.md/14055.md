()For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)() ("Grab Sampling") or (h)(3)(i)(B)() ("Integrated Sampling") of this section, since normally only one (1) sample per flare will be analyzed for a 3-hour period, the total sulfur concentration of a sample obtained during a given 3-hour period shall be substituted for each hour of such 3-hour period. If integrated sampling for a flare produces more than one (1) sample container during a 3-hour period, and the gas in each container is analyzed separately, the concentrations for the containers shall be averaged. For that flare, the resulting average shall be substituted for each hour of the 3-hour period during which the sampling occurred. The substituted hourly total sulfur concentrations determined per this paragraph shall be used to determine hourly emissions from the flare.

(ii) Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas shall determine the HS concentration of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:

(A) Measure the HS concentration of the gas by continuous HS analyzer. The HS concentration analyzer(s) shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per three (3) minutes, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of "hourly average" in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, be installed, certified (on a concentration basis), and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2, and be subject to and meet the quality assurance and quality control requirements (on a concentration basis) of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F. In cases where the HS analyzer or analyzers are not working or the HS concentration exceeds the range of the analyzer(s), other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine the HS concentration of the gas, which shall then be used to calculate SOemissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when other methods are used; or

(B) Use methods approved by EPA as part of the facility's flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section to estimate the HS concentration of the gas.
