###### Dispersal of pollutants.,dispose of

7.Section 169 applies to facilities which remove, alter, destroy, dispose of, store or prevent the creation or emission of pollutants-including heat. Facilities which merely disperse pollutants (such as tall stacks) do not qualify. However, there is no way toheat other than by transferring B.t.u.'s to the environment. A cooling tower is therefore eligible for certification provided it is used in connection with a pre-1976 plant. A cooling pond or an addition to an outfall structure which results in a decrease in the amount by which the temperature of the receiving water is raised and which meets applicable State standards is likewise eligible.
