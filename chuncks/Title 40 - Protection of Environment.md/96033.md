####### Dose levels and dose selections.

(3)(i) In chronic toxicity tests, it is necessary to have a dose-response relationship as well as a no-observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least three dose levels should be used in addition to the concurrent control group. Dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of effects.

(ii) The high dose level in rodents should elicit some signs of toxicity without causing excessive lethality; for non-rodents, there should be signs of toxicity but there should be no fatalities.

(iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure the lowest dose level should exceed this even though this dose level may result in some signs of toxicity.

(iv) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, the dose level should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.

(v) For rodents, the incidence of fatalities in low and intermediate dose groups and in the controls should be low to permit a meaningful evaluation of the results. For non-rodents, there should be no fatalities.
