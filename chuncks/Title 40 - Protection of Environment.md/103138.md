(v) For diluted exhaust and dilution air, you may assume a constant molar mass of the mixture,for all calibration and all testing as long as your assumed molar mass differs no more than +/-1% from the estimated minimum and maximum molar mass during calibration and testing.

You may assume this, using good engineering judgment, if you sufficiently control the amount of water in calibration air and in dilution air or if you remove sufficient water from both calibration air and dilution air. The following table gives examples of permissible ranges of dilution air dewpoint versus calibration air dewpoint:
