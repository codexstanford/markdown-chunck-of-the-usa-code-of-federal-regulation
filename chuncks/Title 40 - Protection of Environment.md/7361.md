() The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation expressed on a mass basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year COe, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source or GHG-only source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first 12 months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous 12 consecutive months is less than the PAL (a 12-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first 11 months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL.
