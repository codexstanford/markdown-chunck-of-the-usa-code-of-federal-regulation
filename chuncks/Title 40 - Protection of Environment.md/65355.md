####### Poor foundation conditions

mean those areas where features exist which indicate that a natural or human-induced event may result in inadequate foundation support for the structural components of an existing or new CCR unit. For example, failure to maintain static and seismic factors of safety as required in §§ 257.73(e) and 257.74(e) would cause a poor foundation condition.
