####### ยง 53.63 Test procedure: Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.
######## Measure the aerosol concentration with the reference sampler.

(2)(i) Install the reference sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum blockage limit of ยง 53.62(c)(1) or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.

(ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the reference method sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as:

(iii) Remove the reference method sampler from the tunnel.
