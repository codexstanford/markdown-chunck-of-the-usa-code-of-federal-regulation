###### Mysidopsis bahia.

3.2.1.2Several methods for culturing Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp) may be used and are noted in appendix A of Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms (6). To ensure uniformity of mysids, recently hatched mysids should be collected daily from stock cultures and identified by the date of hatch. Mysids used in 48-hour tests should be from a single day's collection, but may have an age range of 5-7 days old. In cases where in-house cultures of mysids are unavailable, organisms may be purchased from a commercial source. Information on the source of test organisms should be submitted in the data report.
