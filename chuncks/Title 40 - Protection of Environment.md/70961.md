(ii) Submitting, within 30 days of the telephone notification, written notification to the appropriate EPA Headquarters office describing the new normal range, the reason for the change, and the basis for stating that the release in the increased amount is continuous and stable in quantity and rate under the definitions in paragraph (b) of this section.
