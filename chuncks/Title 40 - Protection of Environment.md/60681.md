###### ยง 180.226 Diquat; tolerances for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for the residues of the herbicide diquat, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1) resulting from the application of the dibromide salt of diquat. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1) is to be determined by measuring only diquat (6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-a:2&#x2032;,1&#x2032;-c]pyrazinediium):

(2)(i) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide diquat (6,7 dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2'1'-c)pyrazinediium) (calculated as the cation) derived from the application of the dibromide salt to ponds, lakes, reservoirs, marshes, drainage ditches, canals, streams, and rivers which are slow-moving or quiescent in programs of the Corp of Engineers or other Federal or State public agencies and to ponds, lakes and drainage ditches only where there is little or no outflow of water and which are totally under the control of the user, in or on the following food commodities:

(ii) Where tolerances are established at higher levels from other uses of diquat on the subject crops, the higher tolerances applies also to residues of the aquatic uses cited in this paragraph.

(3) Tolerances are established for the plant growth regulator diquat (6,7 dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2'1'-c)pyrazinediium) derived from application of the dibromide salt and calculated as the cation in or on the following food commodites:

(4) A tolerance of 0.5 part per million is established for residues of diquat in potato, granules/flakes and potato, chips.
