###### Applicability.

1.1.2This method applies to the analysis of vapor phase organic or inorganic compounds which absorb energy in the mid-infrared spectral region, about 400 to 4000 cm(25 to 2.5 Âµm). This method is used to determine compound-specific concentrations in a multi-component vapor phase sample, which is contained in a closed-path gas cell. Spectra of samples are collected using double beam infrared absorption spectroscopy. A computer program is used to analyze spectra and report compound concentrations.
