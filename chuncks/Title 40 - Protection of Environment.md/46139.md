####### DPF monitoring conditions.

(iii)The manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that monitoring must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For OBD systems designed to the alternative malfunction criteria of paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, the alternative DPF monitor shall run continuously whenever engine speed and load conditions are within the monitoring area described in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A). The OBD system may make a malfunction or potential malfunction determination during any successful monitoring event but shall include in the enable criteria of any subsequent monitoring events a confirmed successful and complete DPF regeneration. The subsequent monitoring events must be conducted within an operating period that ensures that the detected malfunction has not "healed" due to trapped particulates in the compromised portion of the DPF substrate. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section must be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
