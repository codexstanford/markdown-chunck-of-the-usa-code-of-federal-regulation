####### Process tank

means a tank that is used within a process to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process or a product storage vessel. In many process tanks, unit operations such as reactions and blending are conducted. Other process tanks, such as surge control vessels and bottom receivers, however, may not involve unit operations.
