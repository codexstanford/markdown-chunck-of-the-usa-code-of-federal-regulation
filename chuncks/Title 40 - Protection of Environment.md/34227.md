2.1 You may conduct panel testing to determine the capture efficiency of spray booth emissions. You must follow the instructions and calculations in this appendix A, and use the panel testing procedures in ASTM Method D5087-02, "Standard Test Method for Determining Amount of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Released from Solvent-borne Automotive Coatings and Available for Removal in a VOC Control Device (Abatement)" (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), or the guidelines presented in "Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat" EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14). You must weigh panels at the points described in section 2.5 of this appendix A and perform calculations as described in sections 3 and 4 of this appendix A. You may conduct panel tests on the production paint line in your facility or in a laboratory simulation of the production paint line in your facility.
