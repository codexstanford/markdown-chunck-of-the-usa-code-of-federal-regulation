######## Location of sampling sites.

(d)(1) Sampling sites must be located at the inlet (if emission reduction testing or documentation of inlet methanol or formaldehyde concentration is required) and outlet of the control device (defined in ยง 63.2292) and prior to any releases to the atmosphere. For control sequences with wet control devices (defined in ยง 63.2292) followed by control devices (defined in ยง 63.2292), sampling sites may be located at the inlet and outlet of the control sequence and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.

Facilities demonstrating compliance with a production-based compliance option for a process unit equipped with a wet control device must locate sampling sites prior to the wet control device.
