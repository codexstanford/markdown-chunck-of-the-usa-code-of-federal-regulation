###### ยง 272.2201 Texas State-administered program: Final authorization.
####### Vacated Federal rules.

(5)Texas adopted and was authorized for the Federal rules listed in the Table below which have since been vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379 and 08-1144, respectively; June 27, 2014). The effect of the vacaturs on Texas is that the previously authorized comparable fuels and gasification rules from the State program are no longer be considered part of the Federally authorized program. Thus, EPA may bring enforcement actions under RCRA Section 3008 at facilities that do not comply with the RCRA hazardous waste regulations.
