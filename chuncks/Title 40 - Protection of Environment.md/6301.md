####### Effect of Redesignation or Redesignation Substitute.

(b)(1) An area remains subject to the anti-backsliding obligations for a revoked NAAQS under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section until either EPA approves a redesignation to attainment for the area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS; or EPA approves a demonstration for the area in a redesignation substitute procedure for a revoked NAAQS. Under this redesignation substitute procedure for a revoked NAAQS, and for this limited anti-backsliding purpose, the demonstration must show that the area has attained that revoked NAAQS due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions and that the area will maintain that revoked NAAQS for 10 years from the date of EPA's approval of this showing.

(2) If EPA, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, approves a redesignation to attainment, the state may request that provisions for nonattainment NSR be removed from the SIP, and that other anti-backsliding obligations be shifted to contingency measures provided that such action is consistent with CAA sections 110(l) and 193. If EPA, after notice and comment rulemaking, approves a redesignation substitute for a revoked NAAQS, the state may request that provisions for nonattainment NSR for that revoked NAAQS be removed, and that other anti-backsliding obligations for that revoked NAAQS be shifted to contingency measures provided that such action is consistent with CAA sections 110(l) and 193.
