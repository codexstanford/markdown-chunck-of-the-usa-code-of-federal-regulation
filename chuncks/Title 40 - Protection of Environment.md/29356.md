####### Process unit shutdown

means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which practice or procedure it is technically feasible to clear process material from the process unit, or part of the process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:

(1) An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.

(2) An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit and result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.

(3) The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production.
