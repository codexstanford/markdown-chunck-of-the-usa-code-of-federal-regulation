###### ยง 1065.610 Duty cycle generation.

This section describes how to generate duty cycles that are specific to your engine, based on the normalized duty cycles in the standard-setting part. During an emission test, use a duty cycle that is specific to your engine to command engine speed, torque, and power, as applicable, using an engine dynamometer and an engine operator demand. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section describe how to "normalize" your engine's map to determine the maximum test speed or torque for your engine. The rest of this section describes how to use these values to "denormalize" the duty cycles in the standard-setting parts, which are all published on a normalized basis. Thus, the term "normalized" in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section refers to different values than it does in the rest of the section.
