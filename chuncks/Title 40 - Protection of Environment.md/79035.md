####### Release to water.

(iii)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), (c)(4) (where N = 100). The requirement of 40 CFR 721.91(a)(4) that the amount of the substance estimated to be released to water is calculated before entering control technology is not retained. Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substance will be treated using biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification, then the amount of PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 90 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.
