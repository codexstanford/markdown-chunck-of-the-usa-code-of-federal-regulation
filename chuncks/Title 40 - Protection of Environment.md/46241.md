####### Required testing.

(iv)The testing must verify that communication can be established properly between all emission-related on-board computers and a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool designed to adhere strictly to the communication protocols allowed in paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The testing must also verify that all emission-related information is communicated properly between all emission-related on-board computers and a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (k)(1) of this section and the applicable ISO and SAE specifications including specifications for physical layer, network layer, message structure, and message content. The testing must also verify that the onboard computer(s) can properly respond to a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool request to clear emissions-related DTCs and reset the ready status in accordance with paragraph (k)(4)(ix) of this section. The testing must further verify that the following information can be properly communicated to a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool:

(A) The current ready status from all onboard computers required to support ready status in accordance with SAE J1978 or SAE J1939-73 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) and paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section in the key-on, engine-off position and while the engine is running.

(B) The MIL command status while a deactivated MIL is commanded and while an activated MIL is commanded in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) and paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section in the key-on, engine-off position and while the engine is running, and in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) and paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) of this section during the MIL functional check, if applicable, and, if applicable, (k)(4)(i)(C) of this section during the MIL ready status check while the engine is off.

(C) All data stream parameters required in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) including, if applicable, the proper identification of each data stream parameter as supported in SAE J1979 (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $00).

(D) The CAL ID, CVN, and VIN as required by paragraphs (k)(4)(vi), (k)(4)(vii), and (k)(4)(viii) of this section and in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section).

(E) An emissions-related DTC (permanent, pending, MIL-on, previous-MIL-on) in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939-73 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) including the correct indication of the number of stored DTCs (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $01, Data A for SAE J1979 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section)) and paragraph (k)(4)(iv) of this section.
