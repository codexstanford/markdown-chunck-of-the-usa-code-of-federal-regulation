####### Deciview index

means a value for a day that is derived from calculated or measured light extinction, such that uniform increments of the index correspond to uniform incremental changes in perception across the entire range of conditions, from pristine to very obscured. The deciview index is calculated based on the following equation (for the purposes of calculating deciview using IMPROVE data, the atmospheric light extinction coefficient must be calculated from aerosol measurements and an estimate of Rayleigh scattering):

Deciview index = 10 ln (b/10 Mm).

b= the atmospheric light extinction coefficient, expressed in inverse megameters (Mm-1).
