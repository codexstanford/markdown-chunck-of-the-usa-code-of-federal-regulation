####### 13.3.2 Repeatability Check Calculations.

Determine the highest and lowest average "measurement data phase" CO concentrations from the four repeatability check runs and record the results on Figure 1 or a similar form. The absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum average values recorded must not vary more than +/-3 percent or +/-1 ppm of the up-scale gas value, whichever is less restrictive.
