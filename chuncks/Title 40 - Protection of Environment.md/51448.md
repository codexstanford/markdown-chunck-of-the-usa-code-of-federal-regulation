###### ยง 98.3 What are the general monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping and verification requirements of this part?
####### e.g.,,i.e.,

(i) Calibrate each transmitter at a zero point and at least one upscale point. Fixed reference points, such as the freezing point of water, may be used for temperature transmitter calibrations. Calculate the calibration error of each transmitter at each measurement point, using Equation A-3 of this subpart. The terms "R," "A," and "FS" in Equation A-3 of this subpart must be in consistent units of measure (milliamperes, inches of water, psi, degrees). For each transmitter, the CE value at each measurement point shall not exceed 2.0 percent of full-scale. Alternatively, the results are acceptable if the sum of the calculated CE values for the three transmitters at each calibration level (at the zero level and at each upscale level) does not exceed 6.0 percent.
