####### Review of petition to import a used substance.

(3)Starting on the first working day following receipt by the Administrator of a petition to import a used class I controlled substance, the Administrator will initiate a review of the information submitted under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and take action within 40 working days to issue either an objection-notice or a non-objection notice for the individual shipment to the person who submitted the petition to import the used class I controlled substance.

(i) For the following reasons, the Administrator may issue an objection notice to a petition:

(A) If the Administrator determines that the information is insufficient, that is, if the petition lacks or appears to lack any of the information required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section or other information that may be requested during the review of the petition necessary to verify that the controlled substance is used;

(B) If the Administrator determines that any portion of the petition contains false or misleading information, or the Administrator has information from other U.S. or foreign government agencies indicating that the petition contains false or misleading information;

(C) If the importer wishes to import a used class I controlled substance from a country which is, for that particular controlled substance, out of compliance regarding its phaseout obligations under the Protocol or the transaction in the petition is contrary to other provisions in the Vienna Convention or the Montreal Protocol;

(D) If the appropriate government agency in the exporting country has not agreed to issue an export license for the cited individual shipment of used controlled substance;

(E) If allowing the import of the used class I controlled substance would run counter to government restrictions from either the country of recovery or export regarding controlled ozone-depleting substances;

(F) If reclamation capacity is installed or is being installed for that specific controlled substance in the country of recovery or country of export and the capacity is funded in full or in part through the Multilateral Fund.

(ii) Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the objection notice, the importer may re-petition the Administrator, only if the Administrator indicated "insufficient information" as the basis for the objection notice. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day after the date on the objection notice, the objection shall become final. Only one appeal of re-petition will be accepted for any petition received by EPA.

(iii) Any information contained in the re-petition which is inconsistent with the original petition must be identified and a description of the reason for the inconsistency must accompany the re-petition.

(iv) In cases where the Administrator does not object to the petition based on the criteria listed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, the Administrator will issue a non-objection notice.

(v) To pass the approved used class I controlled substances through U.S. Customs, the non-objection notice issued by EPA must accompany the shipment through U.S. Customs.

(vi) If for some reason, following EPA's issuance of a non-objection notice, new information is brought to EPA's attention which shows that the non-objection notice was issued based on false information, then EPA has the right to:

(A) Revoke the non-objection notice;

(B) Pursue all means to ensure that the controlled substance is not imported into the United States; and

(C) Take appropriate enforcement actions.

(vii) A person receiving the non-objection notice is permitted to import the individual shipment only within one year of the date stamped on the non-objection notice.

(viii) A person receiving a non-objection notice from the Administrator for a petition to import used class I controlled substances must maintain the following records:

(A) a copy of the petition;

(B) the EPA non-objection notice;

(C) the bill of lading for the import; and

(D) The U.S. Customs entry number.
