####### Useful life

means the period during which a vehicle is required to comply with all applicable emission standards, specified as a given number of calendar years and kilometers (whichever comes first). In some cases, useful life is also limited by a given number of hours of engine operation. If an engine has no odometer (or hour meter), the specified number of kilometers (or hours) does not limit the period during which an in-use vehicle is required to comply with emission standards, unless the degree of service accumulation can be verified separately. The useful life for an engine family must be at least as long as both of the following:

(1) The expected average service life before the vehicle is remanufactured or retired from service.

(2) The minimum useful life value.
