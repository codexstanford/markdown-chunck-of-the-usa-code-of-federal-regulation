####### Methane correction factor

means an adjustment factor applied to the methane generation rate to account for portions of the landfill that remain aerobic. The methane correction factor can be considered the fraction of the total landfill waste volume that is ultimately disposed of in an anaerobic state. Managed landfills that have soil or other cover materials have a methane correction factor of 1.
