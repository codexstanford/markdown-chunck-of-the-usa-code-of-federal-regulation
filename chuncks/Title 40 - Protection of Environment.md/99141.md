####### Fuel venting.

(b)(1) The fuel venting standard in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies to new subsonic and supersonic aircraft engines subject to this part. This fuel venting standard also applies to the following in-use engines:

(i) Turbojet and turbofan engines with rated output at or above 36 kN thrust manufactured after February 1, 1974.

(ii) Turbojet and turbofan engines with rated output below 36 kN thrust manufactured after January 1, 1975.

(iii) Turboprop engines manufactured after January 1, 1975.

(2) Engines may not discharge liquid fuel emissions into the atmosphere. This standard is directed at eliminating intentional discharge of liquid fuel drained from fuel nozzle manifolds after engines are shut down and does not apply to normal fuel seepage from shaft seals, joints, and fittings. Certification for the fuel venting standard will be based on an inspection of the method designed to eliminate these emissions.
