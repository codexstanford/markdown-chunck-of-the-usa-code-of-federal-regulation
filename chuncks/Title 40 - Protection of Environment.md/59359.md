####### What standards do my stationary pesticide containers have to meet?

(f)If a stationary pesticide container designed to hold undivided quantities of pesticides equal to or greater than 500 gallons (1,890 liters) of liquid pesticide or equal to or greater than 4,000 pounds (1,818 kilograms) of dry pesticide is located at the refilling establishment of a refiller operating under written contract to you, the stationary pesticide container must meet the following standards:

(1) Except during a civil emergency or any unanticipated grave natural disaster or other natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character, the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight, each stationary pesticide container (for liquid and dry pesticides) and its appurtenances must meet both of the following standards:

(i) Each stationary pesticide container and its appurtenances must be resistant to extreme changes in temperature and constructed of materials that are adequately thick to not fail and that are resistant to corrosion, puncture, or cracking.

(ii) Each stationary pesticide container must be capable of withstanding all operating stresses, taking into account static heat, pressure buildup from pumps and compressors, and any other foreseeable mechanical stresses to which the container may be subjected in the course of operations.

(2) Each stationary container of liquid pesticides must meet all of the following standards:

(i) Each stationary container of liquid pesticides must be equipped with a vent or other device designed to relieve excess pressure, prevent losses by evaporation, and exclude precipitation.

(ii) External sight gauges, which are pesticide-containing hoses or tubes that run vertically along the exterior of the container from the top to the bottom, are prohibited on stationary containers of liquid pesticides.

(iii) Each connection on a stationary container of liquid pesticides that is below the normal liquid level must be equipped with a shutoff valve which is capable of being locked closed. A shutoff valve must be located within a secondary containment unit if one is required by subpart E of this part.
