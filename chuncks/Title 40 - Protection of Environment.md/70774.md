###### Interpretation.,i.e.

4.7.34.7.3.1 If the F-statistic for the interaction is significant at the 0.05 level (, p-value is less than 0.05), the data indicate that the mean response of at least two groups being tested differ for at least one point in time. In order to find out which groups and at which points in time the difference occurs, pairwise comparisons between the group means should be conducted for all time points. These comparisons can be made using protected least squared difference (LSD) or Dunnett mean separation techniques. The protected LSD procedure is detailed in Snedecor and Cochran (12); the Dunnett procedure is outlined in Montgomery (13). For both methods, the mean square error (MSE) from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.
