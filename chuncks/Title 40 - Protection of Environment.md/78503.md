(b)This part requires that only one report be submitted on each import transaction involving a chemical substance described in ยง 711.5. When two or more persons are involved in a particular import transaction and each person meets the Agency's definition of "importer" as set forth in 40 CFR 704.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report; if no report is submitted as required under this part, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to report.
