(B) Support for the use of manufacturer specifications if you recommend such specifications in lieu of basing operating limits on performance test operating levels, as required by ยง 63.1209(m)(1)(iv)(D).

(xxv) If your source is equipped with a dry scrubber to control hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, you must document in the comprehensive performance test plan key parameters that affect adsorption, and the limits you establish for those parameters based on the sorbent used during the performance test, if you elect not to specify and use the brand and type of sorbent used during the comprehensive performance test, as required by ยง 63.1209(o)(4)(iii)(A); and

(xxvi) For purposes of calculating semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, mercury, and total chlorine (organic and inorganic), and ash feedrate limits, a description of how you will handle performance test feedstream analytical results that determines these constituents are not present at detectable levels.
