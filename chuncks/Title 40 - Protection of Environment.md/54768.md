###### § 127.26 Implementation plan (authorized states, tribes, and territories).
####### Authorized NPDES program implementation plans.,e.g.,

(h)A state, tribe, or territory that is designated by EPA as the initial recipient [see §§ 127.2(b) and 127.27] for an NPDES data group [as defined in § 127.2(c)] must submit an implementation plan to EPA for review. EPA will inform the authorized NPDES program if the implementation plan is adequate. This plan must provide enough details (tasks, milestones, roles and responsibilities, necessary resources) to clearly describe how the program will successfully implement this part (including a description of their electronic reporting waiver approval process); however, this plan does not include electronic reporting of Discharge Monitoring Reports or Forms Provided or Specified by the Director (DMRs) [40 CFR 122.41(l)(4)]. These implementation plans must be submitted to EPA by December 21, 2016 for EPA review.
