8.6.1Evacuate the gas cell to &#x2264;5 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric pressure with the CTS gas. Alternatively, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of CTS gas. (If purge is used, verify that the CTS concentration in the cell is stable by collecting two spectra 2 minutes apart as the CTS gas continues to flow. If the absorbance in the second spectrum is no greater than in the first, within the uncertainty of the gas standard, then this can be used as the CTS spectrum.) Record the spectrum.
