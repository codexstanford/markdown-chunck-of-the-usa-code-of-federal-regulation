###### ยง 1066.255 Parasitic loss verification.
####### Procedure.

(c)Perform this verification by following the dynamometer manufacturer's specifications to establish a parasitic loss curve, taking data at fixed speed intervals to cover the range of vehicle speeds that will occur during testing. You may zero the load cell at a selected speed if that improves your ability to determine the parasitic loss. Parasitic loss forces may never be negative. Note that the torque transducers must be mathematically zeroed and spanned prior to performing this procedure.
