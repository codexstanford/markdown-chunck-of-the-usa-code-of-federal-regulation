####### 7.1 Calibration Gases.

CO calibration gases for the EC cell must be CO in nitrogen or CO in a mixture of nitrogen and O. Use CO calibration gases with labeled concentration values certified by the manufacturer to be within +/-5 percent of the label value. Dry ambient air (20.9 percent O) is acceptable for calibration of the Ocell. If needed, any lower percentage Ocalibration gas must be a mixture of Oin nitrogen.
