###### 4.1 PCB and PCDPE have similar molecular weight and chromatographic properties to PCDD and PCDF.,i.e.,

PCB may produce fragment ions at interfering mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) when losing chlorine (Cl) or 2 Clduring ionization processes. With HRMS, GC separation, and fractionation, PCB should not pose a problem for PCDD/PCDF identification and quantitation. PCDPE, when losing Clalso produce interfering m/z values in the PCDF homolog group with two fewer chlorine atoms (an octachlorinated PCDPE can interfere with a hexachlorinated PCDF). The latter interferences are potentially detected by monitoring an m/z corresponding to the potentially interfering PCDPE; however, the fragmentation patterns of all PCDPE may not be known, complicating any attempt to quantify the extent of ether interference.

Consider monitoring 328 m/z if high levels of PCB are expected.
