####### Actual mass removal calculation procedure for open or closed aerobic biological treatment processes.

(5)The actual mass removal (AMR) shall be calculated using Equation WW12 as specified in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section when the performance test is performed across the open or closed aerobic biological treatment process only. If compliance is being demonstrated in accordance with § 63.145(a)(7)(i), the AMR for the series shall be calculated using Equation WW13 in § 63.145(f)(5)(ii). (This equation is for situations where treatment is performed in a series of treatment processes connected by hard-piping.) If compliance is being demonstrated in accordance with § 63.145(a)(7)(ii), the AMR for the biological treatment process shall be calculated using Equation WW12 in § 63.145(f)(5)(i). The AMR for the biological treatment process used in a series of treatment processes calculated using Equation WW12 shall be added to the AMR determined for each of the other individual treatment processes in the series of treatment processes.

(i) Calculate AMR for the open or closed aerobic biological treatment process as follows:

(ii) Calculate AMR across a series of treatment units where the last treatment unit is an open or closed aerobic biological treatment process as follows:
