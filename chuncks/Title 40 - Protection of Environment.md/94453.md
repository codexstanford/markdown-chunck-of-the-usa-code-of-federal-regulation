###### ยง 761.347 First level sampling - waste from existing piles.
####### Setting up the sample site selection system from a pile.,t,,s,,r.

(3)Locate a sample in a pile by the use of three parameters: a particular radial direction, "r," from the peak at the center of the pile to the outer edge at the base of the pile; a point, "s," along that radial direction between the peak of the pile and the outer edge of the base of the pile; and a depth, "t", beneath point "s." The top of the sample material will be below depthat pointon radiusUse a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle as a marker. Nail or otherwise fasten to the top of the marker two pieces of string or cord of sufficient length and strength to reach from the top of the marker at the top of the pile to the farthest peripheral edge at the bottom of the pile, when the marker is positioned at the top or apex of the pile. Pound or push the marker into the top center (apex) of the pile, downward toward the center of the base. Insert the marker for at least 30 cm or one foot until the marker is rigidly standing on its own, even when the cord is pulled tight to the bottom peripheral edge of the pile. Ensure that the marker protrudes from the top of the pile sufficiently to allow the strings to move easily around the pile when they are pulled tight. Select the three parameters and the sampling location as follows:

(i) Determine the radial component (r) of the location for each sample.
