####### Open crankcase emissions

means any flow from an engine's crankcase that is emitted directly into the environment. Crankcase emissions are not "open crankcase emissions" if the engine is designed to always route all crankcase emissions back into the engine (for example, through the intake system or an aftertreatment system) such that all the crankcase emissions, or their products, are emitted into the environment only through the engine exhaust system.
