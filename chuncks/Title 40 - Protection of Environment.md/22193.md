###### 6.2.8.1 Dual Range Analyzers.

For certain applications, a wide range of gas concentrations may be encountered, necessitating the use of two measurement ranges. Dual-range analyzers are readily available for these applications. These analyzers are often equipped with automated range-switching capability, so that when readings exceed the full-scale of the low measurement range, they are recorded on the high range. As an alternative to using a dual-range analyzer, you may use two segments of a single, large measurement scale to serve as the low and high ranges. In all cases, when two ranges are used, you must quality-assure both ranges using the proper sets of calibration gases. You must also meet the interference, calibration error, system bias, and drift checks. However, we caution that when you use two segments of a large measurement scale for dual range purposes, it may be difficult to meet the performance specifications on the low range due to signal-to-noise ratio considerations.
