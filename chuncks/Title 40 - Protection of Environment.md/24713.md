######## Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.

(d)For a municipal waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the capacity of the municipal waste combustion unit based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:

(1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on this maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:

(i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).

(ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).

(2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
