(5) ASTM UOP539-97 Refinery Gas Analysis by Gas Chromatography (incorporated by reference,ยง 98.7).

(6) As an alternative to the gas chromatography methods provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section, you may use total gaseous organic concentration analyzers and calculate the CHconcentration following the requirements in paragraphs (g)(6)(i) through (g)(6)(iii) of this section.

(i) Use Method 25A or 25B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to determine total gaseous organic concentration. You must calibrate the instrument with CHand determine the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon (or as CH; K = 1 in Equation 25A-1 of Method 25A at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7).

(ii) Determine a non-methane organic carbon correction factor at the routine sampling location no less frequently than once a reporting year following the requirements in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(A) through (g)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.

(A) Take a minimum of three grab samples of the biogas with a minimum of 20 minutes between samples and determine the methane composition of the biogas using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section.

(B) As soon as practical after each grab sample is collected and prior to the collection of a subsequent grab sample, determine the total gaseous organic concentration of the biogas using either Method 25A or 25B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 as specified in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section.

(C) Determine the arithmetic average methane concentration and the arithmetic average total gaseous organic concentration of the samples analyzed according to paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(A) and (g)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, respectively, and calculate the non-methane organic carbon correction factor as the ratio of the average methane concentration to the average total gaseous organic concentration. If the ratio exceeds 1, use 1 for the non-methane organic carbon correction factor.

(iii) Calculate the CHconcentration as specified in Equation II-8 of this section.

(h) For each anaerobic process (such as an anaerobic reactor, sludge digester, or lagoon) from which biogas is recovered, install, operate, maintain, and calibrate a gas flow meter capable of continuously measuring the volumetric flow rate of the recovered biogas using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(8) of this section or as specified by the manufacturer. Recalibrate each gas flow meter either biennially (every 2 years) or at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer. Except as provided in ยง 98.353(c)(2)(iii), each gas flow meter must be capable of correcting for the temperature and pressure and, if necessary, moisture content.
