###### Calibration Drift,24-hour

6.2.6(). Using the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between the calibration concentration reading after zero and calibration adjustment and the calibration concentration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Report the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
