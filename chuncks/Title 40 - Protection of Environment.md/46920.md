####### Chassis dynamometer procedure.

(1)(i) Vehicle driving on a chassis dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS cycle. Driving in testing performed by the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles as driven in the manufacturer's certification testing.

(ii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank fuel capacity (total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual fuel tanks) shall be determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank volume. If this "fuel consumed point" occurs partway through a UDDS cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety.

(iii) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which this occurs.

(iv) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer. The vehicle may be parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if required.

(v) During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be positioned as described in ยง 86.135-94(b).
