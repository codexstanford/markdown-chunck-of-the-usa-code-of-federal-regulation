####### Process condenser

means a condenser whose primary purpose is to recover material as an integral part of a process. The condenser must support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of source equipment operation that are above the boiling or bubble point of substance(s). Examples of process condensers include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, process condensers in line prior to the vacuum source, and process condensers used in stripping or flashing operations.
