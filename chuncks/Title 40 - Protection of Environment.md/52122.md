####### Initial scoping speciation to identify fluorinated GHGs.

(a)You must conduct an initial scoping speciation to identify all fluorinated GHGs that may be generated from processes that are subject to this subpart and that have at least one process vent with uncontrolled emissions of 1.0 metric ton or more of fluorinated GHGs per year based on the preliminary estimate of emissions in ยง 98.123(c)(1). You are not required to quantify emissions under this initial scoping speciation. Only fluorinated GHG products and by-products that occur in greater than trace concentrations in at least one stream must be identified under this paragraph.
