######## Malfunction

means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused, in part, by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. During periods of malfunction the operator must operate within established parameters as much as possible, and monitoring of all applicable operating parameters must continue until all waste has been combusted or until the malfunction ceases, whichever comes first.
