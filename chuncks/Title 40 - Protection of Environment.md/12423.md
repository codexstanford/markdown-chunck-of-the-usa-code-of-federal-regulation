() Method 24A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the VOM content and density of rotogravure printing inks and related coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the plant coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24A results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24A test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24A test will govern.
