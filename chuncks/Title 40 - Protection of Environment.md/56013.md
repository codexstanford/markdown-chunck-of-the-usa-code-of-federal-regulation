(i)Pursuant to the procedures in ยง 142.19 of this chapter, EPA Regional Administrator may review optimal corrosion control treatment determinations made by a State under paragraph (d)(1) or (2), (f), or (h) of this section and issue Federal treatment determinations consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (2), (f), or (h) of this section where the Regional Administrator finds that:

(1) A State has failed to issue a treatment determination by the applicable deadlines contained in ยง 141.81;

(3) The technical aspects of a State's determination would be indefensible in a Federal enforcement action taken against a water system.
