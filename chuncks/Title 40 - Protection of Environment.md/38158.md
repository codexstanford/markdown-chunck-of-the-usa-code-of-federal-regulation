####### ยง 63.10023 How do I establish my PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it?

(a) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the filterable PM, individual non-mercury HAP metals, or total non-mercury HAP metals limit (or for liquid oil-fired units, individual HAP metals or total HAP metals limit, including Hg) in Table 1 or 2, record all hourly average output values (e.g., milliamps, stack concentration, or other raw data signal) from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (e.g., nine 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 3-hour test runs).

(b) Determine your operating limit as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test.

(1) [Reserved]

(2) Determine your operating limit as follows:

(i) If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emissions do not exceed 75 percent of your emissions limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. Calculate the operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 compliance test with the procedures in (b)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures.
