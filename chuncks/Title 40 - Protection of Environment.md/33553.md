####### ยง 63.2406 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Annual average true vapor pressure

means the equilibrium partial pressure exerted by the total organic HAP in Table 1 to this subpart in the stored or transferred organic liquid. For the purpose of determining if a liquid meets the definition of an organic liquid, the vapor pressure is determined using conditions of 77 degrees Fahrenheit and 29.92 inches of mercury. For the purpose of determining whether an organic liquid meets the applicability criteria in Table 2 to this subpart, items 1 through 6, or Table 2b to this subpart, items 1 through 3, use the actual annual average temperature as defined in this subpart. The vapor pressure value in either of these cases is determined:

(1) Using standard reference texts; or

(2) [Reserved]

(3) Using any other method that the EPA approves.
