######## Spray-applied coating operations

means coatings that are applied using a hand-held device that creates an atomized mist of coating and deposits the coating on a substrate. For the purposes of this subpart, spray-applied coatings do not include the following materials or activities:

(1) Coatings applied from a hand-held device with a paint cup capacity that is equal to or less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cubic centimeters) for devices that do not use a paint cup liner, or with a paint cup liner capacity that is equal to or less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cubic centimeters) for devices that use a paint cup liner. Repeatedly refilling and reusing a 3.0 fluid ounce cup or cup liner or using multiple 3.0 fluid ounce cup liners to complete a single spray applied coating operation as a means of avoiding rule applicability will be considered an attempt to circumvent the requirements of this subpart.

(2) Surface coating application using powder coating, hand-held, non-refillable aerosol containers, or non-atomizing application technology, including, but not limited to, paint brushes, rollers, hand wiping, flow coating, dip coating, electrodeposition coating, web coating, coil coating, touch-up markers, or marking pens.

(3) Thermal spray operations (also known as metallizing, flame spray, plasma arc spray, and electric arc spray, among other names) in which solid metallic or non-metallic material is heated to a molten or semi-molten state and propelled to the work piece or substrate by compressed air or other gas, where a bond is produced upon impact.
