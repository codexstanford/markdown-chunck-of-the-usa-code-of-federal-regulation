############### ยง 60.4335 How do I demonstrate compliance for NOif I use water or steam injection?

(a) If you are using water or steam injection to control NOemissions, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous monitoring system to monitor and record the fuel consumption and the ratio of water or steam to fuel being fired in the turbine when burning a fuel that requires water or steam injection for compliance.

(b) Alternatively, you may use continuous emission monitoring, as follows:

(1) Install, certify, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) consisting of a NOmonitor and a diluent gas (oxygen (O) or carbon dioxide (CO)) monitor, to determine the hourly NOemission rate in parts per million (ppm) or pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu); and

(2) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) to continuously measure the heat input to the affected unit; and

(3) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a watt meter (or meters) to continuously measure the gross electrical output of the unit in megawatt-hours; and

(4) For combined heat and power units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters for useful recovered energy flow rate, temperature, and pressure, to continuously measure the total thermal energy output in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).
