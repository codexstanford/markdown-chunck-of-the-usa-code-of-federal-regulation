####### Alternate CO standards.

(i)Manufacturers/remanufacturers may certify locomotives to an alternate CO emission standard of 10.0 g/bhp-hr instead of the otherwise applicable CO standard if they also certify those locomotives to alternate PM standards as follows:

(1) The alternate PM standard for Tier 0, Tier 1, and Tier 2 locomotives is one-half of the otherwise applicable PM standard. For example, a manufacturer certifying Tier 2 switch locomotives to a 0.065 g/bhp-hr PM standard may certify those locomotives to the alternate CO standard of 10.0 g/bhp-hr.

(2) The alternate PM standard for Tier 3 and Tier 4 locomotives is 0.01 g/bhp-hr.
