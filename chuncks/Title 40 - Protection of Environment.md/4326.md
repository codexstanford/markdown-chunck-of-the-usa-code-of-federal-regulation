###### Calibration:

9.4.1Flow measuring devices used for the on-site flow measurements required in 9.4.2 must be calibrated against a reliable flow or volume standard such as an NBS traceable bubble flowmeter or calibrated wet test meter. Rotameters or critical orifices used in the sampling train may be calibrated, if desired, as a quality control check, but such calibration shall not replace the on-site flow measurements required by 9.4.2. In-line rotameters, if they are to be calibrated, should be calibrated in situ, with the appropriate volume of solution in the absorber.
