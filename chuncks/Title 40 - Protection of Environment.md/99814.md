####### Vehicle configurations for mixed-use engines.

(iv)If the engine will be installed in a combination of vehicles defined in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, use good engineering judgment to select at least nine vehicle configurations from Table 2 and Table 3 in this section that best represent the range of vehicles your engine will be sold in. This may require you to define additional representative vehicle configurations. For example, if your engines will be installed in vocational Medium HDV and vocational Heavy HDV, you might select Tests 2, 4, 6 and 8 of Table 2 in this section to represent vocational Medium HDV and Tests 3, 6, and 9 of Table 3 in this section to represent vocational Heavy HDV and add two more vehicle configurations that you define.
