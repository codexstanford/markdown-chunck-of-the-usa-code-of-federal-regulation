####### Test substance delivery system.

(iii)(A) In the flow-through test, proportional diluters, metering pump systems or other suitable systems should be used to deliver the test substance to the test chambers.

(B) The test substance delivery system shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test substance in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance delivery system should be checked twice daily during a test. The 24-hour flow rate through a test chamber shall be equal to at least five times the volume of the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates shall not vary more than 10 percent from any one test chamber to another. For the renewal test, test substance dilution water shall be completely replaced at least once every 3 days.
