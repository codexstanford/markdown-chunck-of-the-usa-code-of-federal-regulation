3. To determine the uncontrolled (, prior to acid gas APCS) emission rate of HCl and Cl, multiply the feed rate of chlorine times the partitioning factor for each pollutant. Then, for HCl, convert the chlorine emission rate to HCl by multiplying it by the ratio of the molecular weight of HCl to the molecular weight of Cl (, 36.5/35.5). No conversion is needed for Cl.

This section: (1) Explains why ash feed rate limits are not applicable to cement and light-weight aggregate kilns; (2) presents the default partitioning values for ash; and (3) explains how to convert the 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% O, PM emission limit to a PM emission rate.
