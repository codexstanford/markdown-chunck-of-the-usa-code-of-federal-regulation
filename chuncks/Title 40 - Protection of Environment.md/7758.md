EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the State of Arizona on April 13, 1994 for the Maricopa County ozone nonattainment area from the NORACT requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Phoenix area from implementing the NOrequirements for RACT, new source review (NSR), and the applicable general and transportation conformity and inspection and maintenance (I/M) requirements of the CAA. The exemption is based on Urban Airshed Modeling as lasts for only as long as the area's modeling continues to demonstrate attainment without NOreductions from major stationary sources.
