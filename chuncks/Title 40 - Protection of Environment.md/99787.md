####### f,f,T

(iv) Start fuel-map testing at the highest speed setpoint and highest torque setpoint, followed by decreasing torque setpoints at the highest speed setpoint. Continue testing at the next lowest speed setpoint and the highest torque setpoint at that speed setpoint, followed by decreasing torque setpoints at that speed setpoint. Follow this pattern through all the speed and torque points, ending with the lowest speed (or) and torque setpoint (= 0). The following figure illustrates an array of test points and the corresponding run order.



(v) The highest torque setpoint for each speed setpoint is an optional reentry point to restart fuel mapping after an incomplete test run.

(vi) The lowest torque setpoint at each speed setpoint is an optional exit point to interrupt testing. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes how to interrupt testing at other times.
