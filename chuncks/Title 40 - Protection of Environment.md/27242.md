####### Closed vent system

means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is configured of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device or back into the process. If gas or vapor from regulated equipment is routed to a process (e.g., to a petroleum refinery fuel gas system), the process shall not be considered a closed vent system and is not subject to closed vent system standards.
