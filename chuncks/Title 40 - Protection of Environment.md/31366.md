() For determining debits from Group 1 continuous process vents, product recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and cannot be assigned a percent reduction in calculating ECPV. The sampling site for measurement of uncontrolled emissions is after the final product recovery device. However, as provided in ยง 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 continuous process vent may add sufficient product recovery to raise the TRE index value above 1.0 or, for Group 1 continuous process vents at an existing affected source producing MBS, above 3.7, thereby becoming a Group 2 continuous process vent. Such a continuous process vent would not be a Group 1 continuous process vent and would, therefore, not be included in determining debits under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)().
