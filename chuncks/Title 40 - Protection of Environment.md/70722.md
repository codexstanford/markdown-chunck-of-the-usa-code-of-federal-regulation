###### Reference toxicant.

3.4.4To aid in comparing results from tests performed by different workers and to detect changes in the condition of the test organisms that might lead to different results, perform reference toxicity tests with reagent grade DSS in addition to the usual control tests. Prepare a stock solution of DSS immediately before use by adding 1 gram of DSS per 500 ml of test water solution. Use exploratory tests before the full scale tests are begun to determine the amount of reference standard to be used in each of the five different concentrations.
