###### Calculation of human food chain threat-waste characteristics factor category value.

4.1.3.2.3For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply the toxicity/persistence factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10. Based on this second product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat-waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
