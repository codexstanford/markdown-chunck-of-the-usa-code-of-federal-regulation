######## Calibration.

(b)Use good engineering judgment to develop a calibration procedure, such as one based on the FID-analyzer manufacturer's instructions and recommended frequency for calibrating the FID. Alternately, you may remove system components for off-site calibration. For a FID that measures THC, calibrate using CHcalibration gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. For a FID that measures CH, calibrate using CHcalibration gases that meet the specifications of § 1065.750. We recommend FID analyzer zero and span gases that contain approximately the flow-weighted mean concentration of Oexpected during testing. If you use a FID to measure CHdownstream of a nonmethane cutter, you may calibrate that FID using CHcalibration gases with the cutter. Regardless of the calibration gas composition, calibrate on a carbon number basis of one (C). For example, if you use a CHspan gas of concentration 200 µmol/mol, span the FID to respond with a value of 600 µmol/mol. As another example, if you use a CHspan gas with a concentration of 200 µmol/mol, span the FID to respond with a value of 200 µmol/mol.
