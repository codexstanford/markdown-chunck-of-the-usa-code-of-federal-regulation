####### Implementation of work practice plans.

(c)On and after November 15, 1993, the owner or operator of a coke oven battery shall implement the provisions of the coke oven emission control work practice plan according to the following requirements:

(1) The owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart on and after November 15, 1993, shall:

(i) Implement the provisions of the work practice plan pertaining to a particular emission point following the second independent exceedance of the visible emission limitation for the emission point in any consecutive 6-month period, by no later than 3 days after receipt of written notification of the second such exceedance from the certified observer. For the purpose of this paragraph (c)(1)(i), the second exceedance is "independent" if either of the following criteria is met:

(A) The second exceedance occurs 30 days or more after the first exceedance;

(B) In the case of coke oven doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, the 29-run average, calculated by excluding the highest value in the 30-day period, exceeds the value of the applicable emission limitation; or

(C) In the case of charging emissions, the 29-day logarithmic average, calculated in accordance with Method 303 in appendix A to this part by excluding the valid daily set of observations in the 30-day period that had the highest arithmetic average, exceeds the value of the applicable emission limitation.

(ii) Continue to implement such plan provisions until the visible emission limitation for the emission point is achieved for 90 consecutive days if work practice requirements are implemented pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. After the visible emission limitation for a particular emission point is achieved for 90 consecutive days, any exceedances prior to the beginning of the 90 days are not included in making a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) The owner or operator of a coke oven battery not subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart until December 31, 1995, shall:

(i) Implement the provisions of the work practice plan pertaining to a particular emission point following the second exceedance in any consecutive 6-month period of a federally enforceable emission limitation for that emission point for coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake systems, or charging operations by no later than 3 days after receipt of written notification from the applicable enforcement agency; and

(ii) Continue to implement such plan provisions for 90 consecutive days after the most recent written notification from the enforcement agency of an exceedance of the visible emission limitation.
