###### Alternative procedures and requirements.

3.9In cases where States wish to utilize different, but equivalent, procedures and requirements for continuous monitoring systems, the State plan must provide a description of such alternative procedures for approval by the Administrator. Some examples of situations that may require alternatives follow:

3.9.1 Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate continuous monitoring systems that require corrections for stack moisture conditions (e.g., an instrument measuring steam generator SOemissions on a wet basis could be used with an instrument measuring oxygen concentration on a dry basis if acceptable methods of measuring stack moisture conditions are used to allow accurate adjustments of the measured SOconcentration to dry basis.)

3.9.2 Alternative locations for installing continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternative locations will enable accurate and representative measurements.

3.9.3 Alternative procedures for performing calibration checks (e.g., some instruments may demonstrate superior drift characteristics that require checking at less frequent intervals).

3.9.4 Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from one affected facility or the combined effluent from two or more identical affected facilities is released to the atmosphere through more than one point (e.g., an extractive, gaseous monitoring system used at several points may be approved if the procedures recommended are suitable for generating accurate emission averages).

3.9.5 Alternative continuous monitoring systems that do not meet the spectral response requirements in Performance Specification 1, appendix B of part 60, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the opacity measurements of a system complying with the requirements in Performance Specification 1. The State may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected facility.
