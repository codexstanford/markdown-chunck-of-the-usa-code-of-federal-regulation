###### Mixing Zone Demonstration Requirements.

F.

1. For purposes of establishing a mixing zone other than as specified in sections D and E above, a mixing zone demonstration must:

a. Describe the amount of dilution occurring at the boundaries of the proposed mixing zone and the size, shape, and location of the area of mixing, including the manner in which diffusion and dispersion occur;

b. For sources discharging to the open waters of the Great Lakes (OWGLs), define the location at which discharge-induced mixing ceases;

c. Document the substrate character and geomorphology within the mixing zone;

d. Show that the mixing zone does not interfere with or block passage of fish or aquatic life;

e. Show that the mixing zone will be allowed only to the extent that the level of the pollutant permitted in the waterbody would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species listed under section 4 of the ESA or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat;

f. Show that the mixing zone does not extend to drinking water intakes;

g. Show that the mixing zone would not otherwise interfere with the designated or existing uses of the receiving water or downstream waters;

h. Document background water quality concentrations;

i. Show that the mixing zone does not promote undesirable aquatic life or result in a dominance of nuisance species; and

j. Provide that by allowing additional mixing/dilution:

i. Substances will not settle to form objectionable deposits;

ii. Floating debris, oil, scum, and other matter in concentrations that form nuisances will not be produced; and

iii. Objectionable color, odor, taste or turbidity will not be produced.

2. In addition, the mixing zone demonstration shall address the following factors:

a. Whether or not adjacent mixing zones overlap;

b. Whether organisms would be attracted to the area of mixing as a result of the effluent character; and

c. Whether the habitat supports endemic or naturally occurring species.

3. The mixing zone demonstration must be submitted to EPA for approval. Following approval of a mixing zone demonstration consistent with sections F.1 and F.2, adjustment to the dilution ratio specified in section D.1 of this procedure shall be limited to the dilution available in the area where discharger-induced mixing occurs.

4. The mixing zone demonstration shall be based on the assumption that a pollutant does not degrade within the proposed mixing zone, unless:

a. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information demonstrate that degradation of the pollutant is expected to occur under the full range of environmental conditions expected to be encountered; and

b. Scientifically valid field studies or other relevant information address other factors that affect the level of pollutants in the water column including, but not limited to, resuspension of sediments, chemical speciation, and biological and chemical transformation.

The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt additivity provisions consistent with (as protective as) this procedure.

A. The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions to protect human health from the potential adverse additive effects from both the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic components of chemical mixtures in effluents. For the chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) listed in Table 1, potential adverse additive effects in effluents shall be accounted for in accordance with section B of this procedure.
