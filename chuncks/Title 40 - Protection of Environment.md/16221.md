###### Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls Test.

(a)The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.3 to establish eligibility for a temporary waiver from interim controls. Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under the assumption of installation of interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional SOcontrols that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2 and calculates gross operating profit. If gross operating profit is negative for any year during which the NSO is in effect, the applicant is eligible for a temporary waiver.
