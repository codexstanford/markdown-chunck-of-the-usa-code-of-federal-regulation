###### Profit Protection Test.

(a)The applicant must complete Schedules B.1 through B.7 to determine eligibility under the Profit Protection Test. Schedules B.1 and B.2 report the base case (without constant controls) revenue and cost forecast, respectively, and Schedule B.3 summarizes Schedules B.1 and B.2. Base case production forecasts should reflect any production curtailments associated with interim controls currently (preforecast) installed on smelters. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule B.6 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Profit Protection Test.

Schedule B.7 presents the calculations for the Profit Protection Test. The applicant enters the forecast profits from Schedules B.3 and B.6. The present value of the forecast profits is then computed for each case. If the present value of forecast pre-tax profits with constant controls is less than 50 percent of the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) the smelter passes the test and is eligible for an NSO. The smelter also passes the test if the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) is negative.
