####### Flow to storage tank direct from wells.

(ii)Calculate CHand COemissions using either of the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.

(A) If well production oil and gas compositions are available through a previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of produced oil and gas from the sub-basin category and assume all of the CHand COin both oil and gas are emitted from the tank.

(B) If well production oil and gas compositions are not available, use default oil and gas compositions in software programs, such as API 4697 E&P Tank, that most closely match the well production gas/oil ratio and API gravity and assume all of the CHand COin both oil and gas are emitted from the tank.
