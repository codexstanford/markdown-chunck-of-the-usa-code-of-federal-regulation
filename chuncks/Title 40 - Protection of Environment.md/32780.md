######## Group 1 furnace with add-on air pollution control devices.

(d)(1) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM and D/F at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard).

(2) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes only clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard).

(3) The owner or operator may choose to determine the rate of reactive flux addition to the group 1 furnace and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all reactive flux added to the group 1 furnace is emitted. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl.

(4) The owner or operator of a sidewell group 1 furnace that conducts reactive fluxing (except for cover flux) in the hearth, or that conducts reactive fluxing in the sidewell at times when the level of molten metal falls below the top of the passage between the sidewell and the hearth, must conduct the performance tests required by paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, to measure emissions from both the sidewell and the hearth.
