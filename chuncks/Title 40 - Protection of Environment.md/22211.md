## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 60 - STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES
##### Appendix A-4 to Part 60 - Test Methods 6 through 10B
###### 8.6 Alternative Interference and System Bias Checks (Dynamic Spike Procedure). If I want to use the dynamic spike procedure to validate my data, what procedure should I follow?

Except for applications under part 75 of this chapter, you may use the dynamic spiking procedure and requirements provided in section 16.1 during each test as an alternative to the interference check and the pre- and post-run system bias checks. The calibration error test is still required under this option. Use of the dynamic spiking procedure for Part 75 applications is subject to the approval of the Administrator.
