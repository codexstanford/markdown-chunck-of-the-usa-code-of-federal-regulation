###### ยง 65.63 Performance and group status change requirements.
####### Group 2A or 2B process change requirements.

(f)Whenever process changes are made that could reasonably be expected to change a Group 2A or 2B process vent to a Group 1 vent, the owner or operator shall recalculate the TRE index value, flow, or TOC or organic hazardous air pollutant (HAP) concentration according to paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as specified for each process vent as necessary to determine whether the process vent is Group 1, Group 2A, or Group 2B and shall maintain the applicable records specified in ยง 65.66(d) and submit the applicable reports specified in ยง 65.67(b). The owner or operator shall perform the group status determination as soon as practical after the process change and within 180 days after the process change. Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production capacity, production rate, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, process changes do not include process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE index value calculation was based.
