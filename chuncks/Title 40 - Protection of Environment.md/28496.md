() The minimum percent full load amperage (PFLA) to the fan motor must be set as the percent of full load amperage under no-load, plus 10 percent. The PFLA is calculated by dividing the no-load amperage value by the highest of the 1-hour average fan amperage values associated with each test run demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limit in ยง 63.862 multiplied by 100 and then adding 10 percent. The no-load amperage value must be determined using manufacturers specifications, or by performing a no-load test of the fan motor for each smelt dissolving tank scrubber; or
