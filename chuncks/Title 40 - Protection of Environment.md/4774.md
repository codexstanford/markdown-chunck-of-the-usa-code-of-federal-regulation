(C) Sort all these daily maximum values from a particular site and year by descending value. (For example: (x[1], x[2], x[3], * * *, x[n]). In this case, x[1] is the largest number and x[n] is the smallest value.) The 98th percentile is determined from this sorted series of daily values which is ordered from the highest to the lowest number. Using the left column of Table 1, determine the appropriate range (row) for the annual number of days with valid data for year y (cn) as determined from step (A). The corresponding "n" value in the right column identifies the rank of the annual 98th percentile value in the descending sorted list of daily site values for year y. Thus, P= the nth largest value.

(b) The 1-hour primary standard design value for a site is mean of the three annual 98th percentile values, rounded according to the conventions in section 4.
