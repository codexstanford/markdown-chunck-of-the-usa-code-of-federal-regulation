####### Calibration gas

means a purified gas mixture used to calibrate gas analyzers. Calibration gases must meet the specifications of ยง 1065.750. Note that calibration gases and span gases are qualitatively the same, but differ in terms of their primary function. Various performance verification checks for gas analyzers and sample handling components might refer to either calibration gases or span gases.
