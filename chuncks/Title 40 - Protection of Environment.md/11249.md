(a) The EPA is conditionally approving a California State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted on November 13, 2015 updating the motor vehicle emissions budgets for nitrogen oxides (NO) and coarse particulate matter (PM) for the 1987 24-hour PMstandard for the San Joaquin Valley PMmaintenance area. The conditional approval is based on a commitment from the State to submit a SIP revision that demonstrates full implementation of the contingency provisions of the 2007 PMMaintenance Plan and Request for Redesignation (September 20, 2007). If the State fails to meet its commitment by June 1, 2017, the approval is treated as a disapproval.

The conditional approval is based on a commitment from the state to submit new or revised rules that will correct deficiencies in the rules listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section by November 9, 2018. If the State fails to meet its commitment by November 9, 2018, the conditional approval is treated as a disapproval.
