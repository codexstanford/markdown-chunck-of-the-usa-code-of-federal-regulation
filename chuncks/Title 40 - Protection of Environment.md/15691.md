######## Calculation of reference method averages and precisions.

(g)(1) For each of the measurement sets, calculate the average PMor PMconcentration obtained with the reference method samplers, using equation 7 of this section:

(2) For each of the measurement sets, calculate the precision of the reference method PMor PMmeasurements as the standard deviation, P, using equation 8 of this section:

(3) For each measurement set, also calculate the precision of the reference method PMor PMmeasurements as the relative standard deviation, RP, in percent, using equation 9 of this section:
