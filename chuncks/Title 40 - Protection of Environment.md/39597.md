######## i.e.,

(ii) For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces during the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (tons of concentrate) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.
