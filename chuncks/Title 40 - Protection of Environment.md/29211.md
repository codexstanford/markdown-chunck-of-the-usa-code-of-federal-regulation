####### Alternative inspection interval.

(e)Following the initial inspection of a fixed roof in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, subsequent inspection of the fixed roof may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific fixed roof designated as "unsafe to inspect." The documentation must include for each fixed roof designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the fixed roof is unsafe to inspect using the applicable procedures under this section.

(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the fixed roof using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the fixed roof. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the fixed roof under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.
