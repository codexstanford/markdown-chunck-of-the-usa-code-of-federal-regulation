For systems using the optional DPF monitoring provision of paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, the manufacturer must perform a separate test using a DPF modified in a manner approved by the Administrator (e.g., drilling of wallflow channel end plugs, drilling of through holes, etc.) and testing at each of the nine test points specified in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section. The manufacturer must also demonstrate that the OBD system will detect a DPF malfunction with the DPF at its maximum level of deterioration (i.e., the filter(s) completely removed from the filter container or "empty" can). Emissions data are not required for the empty can demonstration.
