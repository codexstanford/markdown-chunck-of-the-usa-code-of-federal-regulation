7.1.6

7.1.6.1 Correction of hourly Hg concentration data for moisture is sometimes required when converting Hg concentrations to the units of the applicable Hg emissions limit. In particular, these corrections are required:

7.1.6.1.1 For sorbent trap monitoring systems;

7.1.6.1.2 For Hg CEMS that measure Hg concentration on a dry basis, when you must calculate electrical output-based Hg emission rates; and

7.1.6.1.3 When using certain equations from EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter to calculate heat input-based Hg emission rates.

7.1.6.2 If hourly moisture corrections are required, either use a fuel-specific default moisture percentage from ยง 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter or a certified moisture monitoring system that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, to record the required data. If you use a moisture monitoring system, you must keep hourly records of the stack gas moisture content, as specified in ยง 75.57(c)(3) of this chapter.
