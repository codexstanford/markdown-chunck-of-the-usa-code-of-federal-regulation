###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.7112 What performance tests, design evaluations, and other procedures must I use?
######## e.g.,

(2) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from other fugitive emission sources (road dust). The required observer position relative to the sun must be followed.

(3) If you use wet dust suppression to control PM from PSH operations, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the spray. The water mist must not be confused with particulate matter emissions and is not to be considered VE. When a water mist of this nature is present, you must observe emissions at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible.

(m) On and after the relevant compliance date for your source as specified in ยง 63.7083(e), during startup, kilns must be tested hourly to determine when lime product meets the definition of on-specification lime product.
