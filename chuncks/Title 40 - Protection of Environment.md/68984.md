###### ยง 280.43 Methods of release detection for tanks.
####### Vapor monitoring.

(e)Testing or monitoring for vapors within the soil gas of the excavation zone must meet the following requirements:

(1) The materials used as backfill are sufficiently porous (e.g., gravel, sand, crushed rock) to readily allow diffusion of vapors from releases into the excavation area;

(2) The stored regulated substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system, is sufficiently volatile (e.g., gasoline) to result in a vapor level that is detectable by the monitoring devices located in the excavation zone in the event of a release from the tank;

(3) The measurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not rendered inoperative by the groundwater, rainfall, or soil moisture or other known interferences so that a release could go undetected for more than 30 days;

(4) The level of background contamination in the excavation zone will not interfere with the method used to detect releases from the tank;

(5) The vapor monitors are designed and operated to detect any significant increase in concentration above background of the regulated substance stored in the tank system, a component or components of that substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system;

(6) In the UST excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells that will detect releases within the excavation zone from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and

(7) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.
