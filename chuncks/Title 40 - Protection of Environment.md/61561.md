####### E,H,E

(3) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide fenpyroximate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenpyroximate, ()-1,1-dimethylethyl 4-[[[[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene]amino]oxy]methyl]benzoate and its metabolite ()-4-[(1,3-dimethyl-5-phenoxypyrazol-4-yl)-methyleneaminooxymethyl]benzoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenpyroximate.
