####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new marine engines into U.S. commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR part 1039 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part.
