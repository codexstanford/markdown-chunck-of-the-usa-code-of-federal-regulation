Emissions limits for Johns Manville Corporation in Wayne County contained in Indiana Administrative Code Title 326: Air Pollution Control Board, Article 6: Particulate Rules, Rule 1: Non-attainment Area Limitations, Section 14: Wayne County. Filed with the Secretary of State on September 24, 1999, and effective on October 24, 1999. Published in 23301 on November 1, 1999.

(140) On August 31, 2000, Indiana submitted revised particulate matter emissions regulations for Rolls-Royce Allison in Marion County, Indiana. The submittal amends 326 IAC 6-1-12(a). It includes a name change for the company from the Allison Engine Company to Rolls-Royce Allison and the addition of an alternate fuel, landfill gas. Landfill gas can be used in boilers 1 through 4 of plant 5 and boilers 3, 4, and 7 through 10 of plant 8. These state implementation plan revisions do not change the particulate matter emissions limits.
