###### Definitions
####### ยง 63.5779 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Hazardous air pollutant data sheet (HDS)

means documentation furnished by a material supplier or an outside laboratory to provide the organic HAP content of the material by weight, measured using an EPA Method, manufacturer's formulation data, or an equivalent method. For aluminum coatings, the HDS also documents the solids content by volume, determined from the manufacturer's formulation data. The purpose of the HDS is to help the affected source in showing compliance with the organic HAP content limits contained in this subpart. The HDS must state the maximum total organic HAP concentration, by weight, of the material. It must include any organic HAP concentrations equal to or greater than 0.1 percent by weight for individual organic HAP that are carcinogens, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR part 1910), and 1.0 percent by weight for all other individual organic HAP, as formulated. The HDS must also include test conditions if EPA Method 311 is used for determining organic HAP content.
