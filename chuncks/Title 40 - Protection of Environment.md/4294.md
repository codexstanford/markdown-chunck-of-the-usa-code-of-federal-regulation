###### Spectrophotometer:

7.3.1A spectrophotometer suitable for measurement of absorbances at 548 nm with an effective spectral bandwidth of less than 15 nm is required for analysis. If the spectrophotometer reads out in transmittance, convert to absorbance as follows:

A standard wavelength filter traceable to the National Bureau of Standards is used to verify the wavelength calibration according to the procedure enclosed with the filter. The wavelength calibration must be verified upon initial receipt of the instrument and after each 160 hours of normal use or every 6 months, whichever occurs first.
