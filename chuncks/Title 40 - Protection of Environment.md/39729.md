###### Testing and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.11945 What performance testing requirements must I meet for process vents?
######## Combination of both continuous and batch unit operations.,i.e.,

(3)You must conduct performance tests when the batch process vents are operating at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case conditions, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. For continuous compliance, you must operate the control device as close as possible to your operating limit(s) for the control device established during the initial or subsequent performance tests specified in ยง 63.11925 (d) and (e). If an operating limit is a range, then you must operate the control device as close as possible to the maximum or minimum operating limit for the control device, whichever results in higher emissions (lower emission reduction), unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions.
