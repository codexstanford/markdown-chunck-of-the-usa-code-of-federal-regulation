##### § 50.5 National secondary ambient air quality standard for sulfur oxides (sulfur dioxide).
########### § 50.6 National primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for PM.

(a) The level of the national primary and secondary 24-hour ambient air quality standards for particulate matter is 150 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m), 24-hour average concentration. The standards are attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 µg/m, as determined in accordance with appendix K to this part, is equal to or less than one.

(b) [Reserved]

(c) For the purpose of determining attainment of the primary and secondary standards, particulate matter shall be measured in the ambient air as PM(particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) by:

(1) A reference method based on appendix J and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter, or

(2) An equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.
