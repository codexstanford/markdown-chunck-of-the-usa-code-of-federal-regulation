####### Potential electrical output capacity

means 33 percent of the maximum design heat input capacity of the steam generating unit, divided by 3,413 Btu/KWh, divided by 1,000 kWh/MWh, and multiplied by 8,760 hr/yr (e.g., a steam generating unit with a 100 MW (340 MMBtu/hr) fossil-fuel heat input capacity would have a 289,080 MWh 12 month potential electrical output capacity). For electric utility combined cycle gas turbines the potential electrical output capacity is determined on the basis of the fossil-fuel firing capacity of the steam generator exclusive of the heat input and electrical power contribution by the gas turbine.
