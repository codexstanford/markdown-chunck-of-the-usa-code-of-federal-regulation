####### Integrity.,i.e.

7.2.3+/-5 Âµg/m(assuming sampler's nominal 24-hour air sample volume). Integrity is measured as the PMconcentration equivalent corresponding to the average difference between the initial and the final weights of a random sample of test filters that are weighed and handled under actual or simulated sampling conditions, but have no air sample passed through them (, filter blanks). As a minimum, the test procedure must include initial equilibration and weighing, installation on an inoperative sampler, removal from the sampler, and final equilibration and weighing.
