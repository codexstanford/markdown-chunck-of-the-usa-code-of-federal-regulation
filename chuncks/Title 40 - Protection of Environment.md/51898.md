###### ยง 98.36 Data reporting requirements.
####### i.e.

(C) The annual volume of COemitted from the combustion of biomass,, V, in scf.

(D) The carbon-based F-factor used in Equation C-13 of this subpart, for each type of fossil fuel combusted, in scf COper mmBtu.

(E) The annual average HHV value used in Equation C-13 of this subpart, for each type of fossil fuel combusted, in Btu/lb, Btu/gal, or Btu/scf, as appropriate.

(F) The total quantity of each type of fossil fuel combusted during the reporting year, in lb, gallons, or scf, as appropriate.

(G) Annual biogenic COmass emissions, in metric tons.

(x) When ASTM methods D7459-08 and D6866-16 (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7) are used to determine the biogenic portion of the annual COemissions from MSW combustion, as described in ยง 98.34(d), report:

(A) The results of each quarterly sample analysis, expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., if the biogenic fraction of the COemissions from MSW combustion is 30 percent, report 0.30).

(B) The annual biogenic COmass emissions from MSW combustion, in metric tons.
