####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer (including someone who marinizes a land-based engine), this section allows you to introduce new marine engines into U.S. commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1033 or 1039 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part. This section does not apply for Category 3 engines.
