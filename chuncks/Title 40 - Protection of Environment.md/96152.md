####### Physical measurements.

(8)For inhalation studies, measurements or monitoring should be made of the following:

(i) The rate of airflow should be monitored continuously, but should be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.

(ii) During each exposure period the actual concentrations of the test substance should be held as constant as practicable, monitored continuously and recorded at least three times during the test period: At the beginning, at an intermediate time and at the end of the period.

(iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size analysis should be performed to establish the stability of aerosol concentrations. During exposure, analyses should be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of particle size distribution and homogeneity of the exposure stream.

(iv) Temperature and humidity should be monitored continuously, but should be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
