(iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content, as received, that is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/of coating solids, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC's are added to the coatings during distribution or application.

(2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that continuously uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under ยง 60.462(a) (2) or (3).

(i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device.

(A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected facility that enters the control device using the following equation:

(B) Determine the destruction efficiency of the control device (E) using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the device by the following equation:

(C) Determine overall reduction efficiency (R) using the following equation:

(ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.

(iii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the atmosphere (N) during each calendar month by the following equation:
