###### Federal Implementation Plan for Managing Emissions From Oil and Natural Gas Sources on the Indian Country Lands Within the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah
####### ยง 49.4171 General provisions.
######## Fugitive emissions component

means any component that has the potential to emit fugitive emissions of VOC at an oil and natural gas source, such as valves, connectors, pressure relief devices, open-ended lines, flanges, covers and closed vent systems not subject to ยง 49.4176, thief hatches or other openings on a controlled storage vessel not subject to ยง 49.4173, compressors, instruments, and meters. Devices that vent as part of normal operations, such as natural gas-driven pneumatic controllers or natural gas-driven pneumatic pumps, are not fugitive emissions components, insofar as the natural gas discharged from the device's vent is not considered a fugitive emission. Emissions originating from locations other than the device's vent, such as the thief hatch on a controlled storage vessel, would be considered fugitive emissions.
