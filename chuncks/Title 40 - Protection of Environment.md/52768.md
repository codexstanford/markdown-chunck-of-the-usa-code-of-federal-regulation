###### ยง 98.265 Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable, a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(a) For each missing value of the inorganic carbon content or COcontent of phosphate rock (by origin), you must use the appropriate default factor provided in Table Z-1 of this subpart. Alternatively, you must determine a substitute data value by calculating the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of inorganic carbon contents or COcontents of phosphate rock of origin i (see Equation Z-1a or Z-1b of this subpart) from samples immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If no quality-assured data on inorganic carbon contents or COcontents of phosphate rock of origin i are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value for inorganic carbon contents or COcontents for phosphate rock of origin i obtained after the missing data period.

(b) For each missing value of monthly mass consumption of phosphate rock (by origin), you must use the best available estimate based on all available process data or data used for accounting purposes.
