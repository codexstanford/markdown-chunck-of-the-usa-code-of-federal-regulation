###### ยง 180.706 Valifenalate; tolerances for residues.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide valifenalate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only valifenalate (methyl N-(isopropoxycarbonyl)-L-valyl-(3RS)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-&#x3B2;-alainate), in or on the following commodities.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide valifenalate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only the sum of valifenalate, methyl N-(isopropoxycarbonyl)-L-valyl-(3RS)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-&#x3B2;-alainate and valifenalate acid, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-[[N-(isopropoxycarbonyl)-L-valyl]-amino] propionic acid calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of valifenalate, in or on the following commodities.
