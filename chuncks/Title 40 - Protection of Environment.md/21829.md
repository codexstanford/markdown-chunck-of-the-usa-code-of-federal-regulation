###### Monitoring and Compliance Determination Procedures
####### § 60.5535 How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?
######## e.g.,
######### i.e.,,e.g.,

(a) In accordance with § 60.5520, if you are subject to an output-based emission standard or you burn non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520(d)(2), you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable COemission standard in table 1 or 2 of this subpart as required in this section. For the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month rolling average compliance period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section to calculate the COmass emissions rate for your affected EGU(s) in units of the applicable emissions standard (either kg/MWh or lb/MMBtu). You must use the hourly COmass emissions calculated under § 60.5535(b) or (c), as applicable, and either the generating load data from § 60.5535(d)(1) for output-based calculations or the heat input data from § 60.5535(d)(2) for heat-input-based calculations. Combustion turbines firing non-uniform fuels that contain COprior to combustion (blast furnace gas or landfill gas) may sample the fuel stream to determine the quantity of COpresent in the fuel prior to combustion and exclude this portion of the COmass emissions from compliance determinations.
