######## Feedrate operating limits

means limits on the feedrate of materials (e.g., metals, chlorine) to the combustor that are established based on comprehensive performance testing. The limits are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the limited material (e.g., chlorine) in each feedstream and the flowrate of each feedstream.
