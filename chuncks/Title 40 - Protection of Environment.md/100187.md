(4) Measure the drag area using your alternate method for a Phase 2 tractor used to determinewith testing at yaw angles of 0&#xB0;, +/-1&#xB0;, +/-3&#xB0;, +/-4.5&#xB0;, +/-6&#xB0;, and +/-9&#xB0; (you may include additional angles), using direction conventions described in Figure 2 of SAE J1252 (incorporated by reference in ยง 1037.810). Also, determine the drag area at the coastdown effective yaw angle,(&#x3C8;), by taking the average drag area at &#x3C8;and -&#x3C8;for your vehicle using the same alternate method.
