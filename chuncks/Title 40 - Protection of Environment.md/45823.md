####### Durability demonstration vehicle selection.

(6)The demonstration vehicle used must represent the "worst case" of all the configurations for which the aftermarket part is being certified. The worst case configuration shall be that configuration which will likely cause the most deterioration in the performance characteristics of the aftermarket part which influence emissions during the part's useful life mileage. The worst case configuration shall be selected from among those configurations for which the aftermarket part is to be certified. One of the following two methods shall be used to select the worst case durability demonstration vehicle(s):

(i) In the first method, the selection shall be based on a technical judgment by the aftermarket part manufacturer of the impact of the particular design, or calibration of a particular parameter or combination of parameters, and/or an analysis of appropriate data, or

(ii) In the second alternative method, the selection shall be made from among those vehicle configurations with the heaviest equivalent test weight, and within that group, the largest displacement engine.
