######## Calculate the mean and coefficient of variation for replicate measurements of effectiveness.

(7)(i) Calculate and record the mean sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as:

(ii)(A) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the candidate sampler as:

(B) If the coefficient of variation is not less than 10 percent, then the test run must be repeated (steps in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(7) of this section).

(8) Repeat steps in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(7) of this section for each particle size specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
