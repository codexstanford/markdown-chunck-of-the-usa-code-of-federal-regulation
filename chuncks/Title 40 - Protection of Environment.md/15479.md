5.1.1Set up and operate the measurement system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings. Offset the zero point of the chart recorder so that negative values up to 5 percent of the span value may be registered. Operate the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this initial period, the system should measure the gas stream volumetric flow rate in a normal operational manner. After completion of this conditioning period, the formal 168-hour performance and operational test period shall begin.
