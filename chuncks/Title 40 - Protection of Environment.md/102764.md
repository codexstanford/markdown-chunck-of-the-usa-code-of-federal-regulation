####### ยง 1065.340 Diluted exhaust flow (CVS) calibration.
######## CFV calibration.,C,r,

(h)Calibrate a critical-flow venturi (CFV) to verify its discharge coefficient,up to the highest expected pressure ratio,according to ยง 1065.640. Calibrate a CFV flow meter as follows:

(1) Connect the system as shown in Figure 1 of this section.

(2) Verify that any leaks between the calibration flow meter and the CFV are less than 0.3% of the total flow at the highest restriction.

(3) Start the blower downstream of the CFV.
