######## Process tank

means a tank or vessel that is used within a process to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage tank or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process or a product storage tank. A process tank has emissions that are related to the characteristics of the batch cycle, and it does not accumulate product over multiple batches. Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers are not process tanks.
