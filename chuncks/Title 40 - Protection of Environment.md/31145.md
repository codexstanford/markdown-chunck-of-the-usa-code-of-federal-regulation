####### Recovery operations equipment ownership determination.

(h)The owner or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(6) of this section to determine to which process unit recovery operations equipment shall be assigned. Paragraph (h)(7) of this section specifies when an owner or operator is required to redetermine to which process unit the recovery operations equipment is assigned.

(1) If recovery operations equipment is already subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on September 12, 1996, said recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.

(2) If recovery operations equipment is dedicated to a single process unit, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process unit.

(3) If recovery operations equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process unit located on the same plant site as the recovery operations equipment that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operations equipment (i.e., said process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operations equipment).

(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is a TPPU subject to this subpart, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to said TPPU.

(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are TPPUs that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operations equipment to any one of said TPPUs.

(6) If the predominant use of recovery operations equipment varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 12, 1996 or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for said recovery operations equipment, and based on the first 5 years after initial start-up for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by ยง 63.1335(e)(5)(vii).

(7) If a piece of recovery operations equipment begins receiving material from a process unit that was not included in the initial determination, or ceases to receive material from a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that recovery operations equipment.
