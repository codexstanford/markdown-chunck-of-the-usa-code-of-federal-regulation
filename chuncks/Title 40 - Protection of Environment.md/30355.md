##### Subpart EEE - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Hazardous Waste Combustors
###### Replacement Emissions Standards and Operating Limits for Incinerators, Cement Kilns, and Lightweight Aggregate Kilns
####### § 63.1219 What are the replacement standards for hazardous waste incinerators?
######## Emission limits for new sources.

(b)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

(1)(i) Dioxins and furans in excess of 0.11 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen for incinerators equipped with either a waste heat boiler or dry air pollution control system; or

(ii) Dioxins and furans in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen for sources not equipped with either a waste heat boiler or dry air pollution control system;

(iii) A source equipped with a wet air pollution control system followed by a dry air pollution control system is not considered to be a dry air pollution control system, and a source equipped with a dry air pollution control system followed by a wet air pollution control system is considered to be a dry air pollution control system for purposes of this standard;

(2) Mercury in excess of 8.1 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(3) Cadmium and lead in excess of 10 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(4) Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium in excess of 23 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:

(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(6) Hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas in excess of 21 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, particulate matter emissions in excess of 0.0016 gr/dscf corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
