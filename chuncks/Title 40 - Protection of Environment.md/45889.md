1.

(a) Using test equipment and procedures specified in SAE-J726c, perform:

(i) Air Flow and Pressure Drop Test (2.3) at 200 SCFM, record test conditions and pressure drop.

(ii) Efficiency Test (2.4) to measure full life efficiency at 200 SCFM to a total pressure drop of 9 inches of water, record test conditions and test duration from first to last addition of standard dust, weigh test element and absolute filter at end of test using three randomly selected original equipment air filter elements.

(b) Perform tests as in (a) above, under conditions controlled to within +/-10% of the corresponding original equipment test conditions, for three randomly selected replacement air filter elements.

(c) The replacement air filter element average recorded test results. The pressure drop in (i) and absolute filter weight in (ii) must be equal to or less than those average results for the original equipment test results. The replacement air filter averaged test results for element weight in (ii) must be equal to or larger than averaged result for the original equipment averaged test results.
