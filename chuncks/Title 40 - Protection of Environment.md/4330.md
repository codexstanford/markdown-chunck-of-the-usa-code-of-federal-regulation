###### Spectrophotometer Cell Matching.

10.1If unmatched spectrophotometer cells are used, an absorbance correction factor must be determined as follows:

1. Fill all cells with distilled water and designate the one that has the lowest absorbance at 548 nm as the reference. (This reference cell should be marked as such and continually used for this purpose throughout all future analyses.)

2. Zero the spectrophotometer with the reference cell.

3. Determine the absorbance of the remaining cells (A) in relation to the reference cell and record these values for future use. Mark all cells in a manner that adequately identifies the correction.

The corrected absorbance during future analyses using each cell is determining as follows:
