###### See,

(5) All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. (§§ 136.4 and 136.5.) Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator.

(6) If an Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement in paragraph (e) or (h) of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the Control Authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
