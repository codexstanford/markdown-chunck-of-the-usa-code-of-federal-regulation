####### Determinations of failure to attain the 1997 and/or 1-hour NAAQS.

(2)(i) As of April 6, 2015, the EPA is no longer obligated to determine pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) or section 179(c) whether an area attained the 1997 ozone NAAQS by that area's attainment date for the 1997 ozone NAAQS.

(ii) As of April 6, 2015, the EPA is no longer obligated to reclassify an area to a higher classification for the 1997 ozone NAAQS based upon a determination that the area failed to attain the 1997 ozone NAAQS by the area's attainment date for the 1997 ozone NAAQS.

(iii) For the revoked 1-hour and 1997 ozone NAAQS, the EPA is required to determine whether an area attained the 1-hour or 1997 ozone NAAQS by the area's attainment date solely for anti-backsliding purposes to address an applicable requirement for nonattainment contingency measures and CAA section 185 fee programs. In making such a determination, the EPA may consider and apply the provisions of CAA section 181(a)(5) and former 40 CFR 51.907 in interpreting whether a 1-year extension of the attainment date is applicable under CAA section 172(a)(2)(C).
