(2) For engines with a high-speed governor that will be subject to a reference duty cycle that specifies normalized speeds greater than 100%, calculate an alternate maximum test speed,, as specified in this paragraph (a)(2). Ifis less than the measured maximum test speed,determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, replacewith. In this case,becomes the "maximum test speed" for that engine for all duty cycles. Note that ยง 1065.510 allows you to apply an optional declared maximum test speed to the final measured maximum test speed determined as an outcome of the comparison betweenandin this paragraph (a)(2). Determineas follows:

(3) Transform normalized speeds to reference speeds according to paragraph (c) of this section by using the measured maximum test speed determined according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section-or use your declared maximum test speed, as allowed in ยง 1065.510.
