######## Potential electric output,e.g.,,e.g.,

means 33 percent or the base load rating design efficiency at the maximum electric production rate (CHP units with condensing steam turbines will operate at maximum electric production), whichever is greater, multiplied by the base load rating (expressed in MMBtu/h) of the EGU, multiplied by 10Btu/MMBtu, divided by 3,413 Btu/KWh, divided by 1,000 kWh/MWh, and multiplied by 8,760 h/yr (a 35 percent efficient affected EGU with a 100 MW (341 MMBtu/h) fossil fuel heat input capacity would have a 306,000 MWh 12-month potential electric output capacity).
