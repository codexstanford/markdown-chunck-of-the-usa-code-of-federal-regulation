Due to the CFC's damaging effect on the ozone layer, recycle of CFC-12 (R-12) used in mobile air-conditioning systems is required to reduce system venting during normal service operations. Establishing recycle specifications for R-12 will assure that system operation with recycled R-12 will provide the same level of performance as new refrigerant.

Extensive field testing with the EPA and the auto industry indicate that reuse of R-12 removed from mobile air-conditioning systems can be considered, if the refrigerant is cleaned to a specific standard. The purpose of this standard is to establish the specific minimum levels of R-12 purity required for recycled R-12 removed from mobile automotive air-conditioning systems.

This information applies to refrigerant used to service automobiles, light trucks, and other vehicles with similar CFC-12 systems. Systems used on mobile vehicles for refrigerated cargo that have hermetically sealed, rigid pipe are not covered in this document.

The refrigerant in this document shall have been directly removed from, and intended to be returned to, a mobile air-conditioning system. The contaminants in this recycled refrigerant 12 shall be limited to moisture, refrigerant oil, and noncondensable gases, which shall not exceed the following level:
