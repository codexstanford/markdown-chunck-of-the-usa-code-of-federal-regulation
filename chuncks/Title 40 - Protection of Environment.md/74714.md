####### Process wastewater.

(m)For subparts B and E only, process wastewater is any water that, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct, or waste product. For purposes of subparts B and E of this part, process wastewater includes boiler blowdown; wastewaters from water treatment and other utility operations; blowdowns from high rate (e.g., greater than 98 percent) recycled non-contact cooling water systems to the extent they are mixed and co-treated with other process wastewaters; wastewater, including leachates, from landfills owned by pulp and paper mills subject to subpart B or E of this part if the wastewater is commingled with wastewater from the mill's manufacturing or processing facility; and storm waters from the immediate process areas to the extent they are mixed and co-treated with other process wastewaters. For purposes of this part, contaminated groundwaters from on-site or off-site groundwater remediation projects are not process wastewater.
