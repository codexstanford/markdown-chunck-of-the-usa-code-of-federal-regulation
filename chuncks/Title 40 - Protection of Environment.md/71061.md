####### Extension of time.

(b)The Presiding Officer, or Review Officer as appropriate, may grant an extension of time for the filing of any pleading, document or motion upon timely motion of a party to the proceeding, for good cause shown, and after consideration of prejudice to other parties, or upon his own motion. Such a motion by a party may only be made after notice to all other parties, unless the movant can show good cause why serving notice is impracticable. The motion shall be filed in advance of the date on which the pleading, document or motion is due to be filed, unless the failure of a party to make timely motion for extension of time was the result of excusable neglect.
