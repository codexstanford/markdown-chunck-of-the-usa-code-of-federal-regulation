###### ยง 144.28 Requirements for Class I, II, and III wells authorized by rule.
####### Casing and cementing requirements.

(e)For enhanced recovery and hydrocarbon storage wells:

(1) The owner or operator shall case and cement the well to prevent movement of fluids into or between underground sources of drinking water. In determining and specifying casing and cementing requirements, the following factors shall be considered:

(i) Depth to the injection zone;

(ii) Depth to the bottom of all USDWs; and

(iii) Estimated maximum and average injection pressures.

(2) In addition, in determining and specifying casing and cementing requirements the Director may consider information on:

(i) Nature of formation fluids;

(ii) Lithology of injection and confining zones;

(iii) External pressure, internal pressure, and axial loading;

(iv) Hole size;

(v) Size and grade of all casing strings; and

(vi) Class of cement.

(3) The requirements in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section need not apply if:

(i) Regulatory controls for casing and cementing existed at the time of drilling of the well and the well is in compliance with those controls; and

(ii) Well injection will not result in the movement of fluids into an underground source of drinking water so as to create a significant risk to the health of persons.

(4) When a State did not have regulatory controls for casing and cementing prior to the time of the submission of the State program to the Administrator, the Director need not apply the casing and cementing requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section if he submits as a part of his application for primacy, an appropriate plan for casing and cementing of existing, newly converted, and newly drilled wells in existing fields, and the Administrator approves the plan.
