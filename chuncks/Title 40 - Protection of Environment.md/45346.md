Note that the precision of a weight gain, involves two weight determinations, and therefore is larger than S by a factor of sqrt(2). On the other hand replicate weighings improves the precision of the determinations by a factor of sqrt(N). If N = 2,duplicates, then the factors cancel each other.

To estimate the overall uncertainty in a weight determination, a conservative estimate might be to combine the imprecision contributed by the zero with the imprecision contributed by the calibration.

The uncertainty in a weight gain from N replicates is then given by:

But due to the balance adjustment and reweigh tolerances, we expect Sto approximately equal S, to approximately equal S, etc. tolerances, so that the equation above becomes:
