####### ยง 59.653 How do I test portable fuel containers?
######## Pressure cycling

(1). Perform a pressure test by sealing the container and cycling it between +13.8 and -3.4 kPa (+2.0 and -0.5 psig) for 10,000 cycles at a rate of 60 seconds per cycle. For this test, the spout may be removed, and the pressure applied through the opening where the spout attaches. The purpose of this test is to represent environmental wall stresses caused by pressure changes and other factors (such as vibration or thermal expansion). If your container cannot be tested using the pressure cycles specified by this paragraph (a)(1), you may ask to use special test procedures under ยง 59.652(c).
