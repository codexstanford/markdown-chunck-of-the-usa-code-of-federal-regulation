####### Monitoring data.

(6)Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.1025(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves or § 63.1027(b)(3) for connectors provided the departures from the criteria or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.1025(b)(3) or (b)(4) or § 63.1027(b)(3) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every 6 weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2, paragraph (a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring using a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in this subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
