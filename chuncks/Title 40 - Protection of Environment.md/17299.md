####### Capital expenditure

means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility which exceeds the product of the applicable "annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage" specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the existing facility's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility must not be reduced by any "excluded additions" as defined in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes.
