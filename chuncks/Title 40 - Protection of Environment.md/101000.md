###### ยง 1042.505 Testing engines using discrete-mode or ramped-modal duty cycles.
####### General cycle.

(1)Use the 4-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (a) of Appendix II of this part for commercial propulsion marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with) fixed-pitch propellers, propeller-law auxiliary engines, and any other engines for which the other duty cycles of this section do not apply. Use this duty cycle also for commercial variable-speed propulsion marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, unless these engines are not intended for sustained operation (e.g., for at least 30 minutes) at all four modes when installed in the vessel.
