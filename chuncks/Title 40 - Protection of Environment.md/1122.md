####### Interlocutory review.

(c)If the Presiding Officer has recommended review and the Environmental Appeals Board determines that interlocutory review is inappropriate, or takes no action within 30 days of the Presiding Officer's recommendation, the appeal is dismissed. When the Presiding Officer declines to recommend review of an order or ruling, it may be reviewed by the Environmental Appeals Board only upon appeal from the initial decision, except when the Environmental Appeals Board determines, upon motion of a party and in exceptional circumstances, that to delay review would be contrary to the public interest. Such motion shall be filed within 10 days of service of an order of the Presiding Officer refusing to recommend such order or ruling for interlocutory review.
