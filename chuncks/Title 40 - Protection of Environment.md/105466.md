##### ยง 1700.16 Chain locker effluent.
###### i.e.,

(a) For all vessels, except submarines, the anchor chain must be carefully and thoroughly washed down (more than a cursory rinse) as it is being hauled out of the water to remove sediment and organisms.

(b) For all vessels, the chain lockers must be cleaned periodically to eliminate accumulated sediments and any potential accompanying pollutants. The dates of all chain locker inspections must be recorded in the ship's log or other vessel recordkeeping documentation.

(c) For all vessels that sail seaward of waters subject to UNDS at least once per month, the rinsing or pumping out of chain lockers is prohibited.

(d) For all vessels that do not sail seaward of waters subject to UNDS at least once per month, the rinsing or pumping out of chain lockers must occur as far from shore as possible and, if technically feasible, the rinsing or pumping out of chain lockers must not occur in federally-protected waters.
