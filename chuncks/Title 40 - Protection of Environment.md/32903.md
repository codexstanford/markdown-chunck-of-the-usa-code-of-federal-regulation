####### ยง 63.1573 What are my monitoring alternatives?
######## Can I use another type of monitoring system?,e.g.,

(d)You may use an automated data compression system. An automated data compression system does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency (once every hour) but records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values. You must maintain a record of the description of the monitoring system and data recording system, including the criteria used to determine which monitored values are recorded and retained, the method for calculating daily averages, and a demonstration that the system meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section:

(1) The system measures the operating parameter value at least once every hour;

(2) The system records at least 24 values each day during periods of operation;

(3) The system records the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;

(4) The system recognizes unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not functioning properly, alerts the operator, and records the incident; and

(5) The system computes daily average values of the monitored operating parameter based on recorded data.
