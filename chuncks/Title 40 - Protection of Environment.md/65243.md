###### Closure and Post-Closure Care
####### ยง 257.103 Alternative closure requirements.
######## Permanent cessation of a coal-fired boiler(s) by a date certain.

(2)Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 257.101(a), and (b)(1), a CCR surface impoundment may continue to receive CCR and/or non-CCR wastestreams if the facility will cease operation of the coal-fired boiler(s) and complete closure of the impoundment within the timeframes specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, but in the interim period (prior to closure of the coal-fired boiler), the facility must continue to use the CCR surface impoundment due to the absence of alternative disposal capacity both on and off-site of the facility. To qualify under this paragraph all of the following criteria must be met:

(i) No alternative disposal capacity is available on or off-site. An increase in costs or the inconvenience of existing capacity is not sufficient to support qualification under this section.

(ii) Potential risks to human health and the environment from the continued operation of the CCR surface impoundment have been adequately mitigated;

(iii) The facility is in compliance with all other requirements of this subpart, including the requirement to conduct any necessary corrective action; and

(iv) The coal-fired boilers must cease operation and closure of the impoundment must be completed within the following timeframes:

(A) For a CCR surface impoundment that is 40 acres or smaller, the coal-fired boiler(s) must cease operation and the CCR surface impoundment must complete closure no later than October 17, 2023.

(B) For a CCR surface impoundment that is larger than 40 acres, the coal-fired boiler(s) must cease operation, and the CCR surface impoundment must complete closure no later than October 17, 2028.

(v) The owner or operator of the CCR surface impoundment must submit the following documentation that the criteria in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section have been met as specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(v)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) To demonstrate that the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section have been met the owner or operator must submit a narrative that explains the options considered to obtain alternative capacity for CCR and/or non-CCR wastestreams both on and off-site.

(B) To demonstrate that the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section have been met the owner or operator must submit a risk mitigation plan describing the measures that will be taken to expedite any required corrective action, and that contains all of the following elements:
