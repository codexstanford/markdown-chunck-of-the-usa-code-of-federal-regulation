####### Maximum true vapor pressure

means the equilibrium partial pressure exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored or transferred liquid at the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the liquid storage or transferred temperature for liquids stored or transferred above or below the ambient temperature or at the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service for liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as determined:

(1) In accordance with methods described in Chapter 19.2 of the American Petroleum Institute's Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Evaporative Loss From Floating-Roof Tanks (incorporated by reference as specified in ยง 63.14); or

(2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or

(3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials Method D2879-97, Test Method for Vapor Pressure-Temperature Relationship and Initial Decomposition Temperature of Liquids by Isoteniscope (incorporated by reference as specified in ยง 63.14); or

(4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
