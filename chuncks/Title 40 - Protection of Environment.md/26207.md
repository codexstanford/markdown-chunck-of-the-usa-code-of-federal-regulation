###### § 63.347 Reporting requirements.
####### Notification of compliance status.

(e)(1) A notification of compliance status is required each time that an affected source becomes subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(2) If the State in which the source is located has not been delegated the authority to implement the rule, each time a notification of compliance status is required under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source shall submit to the Administrator a notification of compliance status, signed by the responsible official (as defined in § 63.2) who shall certify its accuracy, attesting to whether the affected source has complied with this subpart. If the State has been delegated the authority, the notification of compliance status shall be submitted to the appropriate authority. The notification shall list for each affected source:

(i) The applicable emission limitation and the methods that were used to determine compliance with this limitation;

(ii) If a performance test is required by this subpart, the test report documenting the results of the performance test, which contains the elements required by § 63.344(a), including measurements and calculations to support the special compliance provisions of § 63.344(e) if these are being followed;

(iii) The type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source reported in mg/dscm or mg/hr if the source is using the special provisions of § 63.344(e) to comply with the standards. (If the owner or operator is subject to the construction and reconstruction provisions of § 63.345 and had previously submitted emission estimates, the owner or operator shall state that this report corrects or verifies the previous estimate.) For sources not required to conduct a performance test in accordance with § 63.343(b), the surface tension measurement may fulfill this requirement;

(iv) For each monitored parameter for which a compliant value is to be established under § 63.343(c), the specific operating parameter value, or range of values, that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limit;

(v) The methods that will be used to determine continuous compliance, including a description of monitoring and reporting requirements, if methods differ from those identified in this subpart;

(vi) A description of the air pollution control technique for each emission point;

(vii) A statement that the owner or operator has completed and has on file the operation and maintenance plan as required by the work practice standards in § 63.342(f);

(viii) If the owner or operator is determining facility size based on actual cumulative rectifier capacity in accordance with § 63.342(c)(2), records to support that the facility is small. For existing sources, records from any 12-month period preceding the compliance date shall be used or a description of how operations will change to meet a small designation shall be provided. For new sources, records of projected rectifier capacity for the first 12-month period of tank operation shall be used;

(ix) A statement by the owner or operator of the affected source as to whether the source has complied with the provisions of this subpart.

(3) For sources required to conduct a performance test by § 63.343(b), the notification of compliance status shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than 90 calendar days following completion of the compliance demonstration required by § 63.7 and § 63.343(b).

(4) For sources that are not required to complete a performance test in accordance with § 63.343(b), the notification of compliance status shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than 30 days after the compliance date specified in § 63.343(a), except the date on which sources in California shall monitor the surface tension of the anodizing bath is extended to January 25, 1998.
