###### ยง 1048.101 What exhaust emission standards must my engines meet?
####### Standards for field testing.

(c)Starting in 2007, exhaust emissions may not exceed field-testing standards, as follows:

(1) Measure emissions using the field-testing procedures in subpart F of this part:

(2) The HC + NOstandard is 3.8 g/kW-hr and the CO standard is 6.5 g/kW-hr. For severe-duty engines, the HC + NOstandard is 3.8 g/kW-hr and the CO standard is 200.0 g/kW-hr. For natural gas-fueled engines, you are not required to measure nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions or total hydrocarbon emissions for testing to show that the engine meets the emission standards of this paragraph (c); that is, you may assume HC emissions are equal to zero.

(3) You may apply the following formula to determine alternate emission standards that apply to your engines instead of the standards in paragraph (c)(1) of this section: (HC + NO) x CO&#x2264;16.78. HC + NOemission levels may not exceed 3.8 g/kW-hr and CO emission levels may not exceed 31.0 g/kW-hr. The following table illustrates a range of possible values under this paragraph (c)(2):
