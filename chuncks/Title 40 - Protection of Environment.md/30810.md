() When wastewater is conveyed exclusively by hard-piping from the point of determination to a treatment process that is either the only treatment process or the first in a series of treatment processes (i.e., no treatment processes or other waste management units are used upstream of this treatment process to store, handle, or convey the wastewater), the inlet to the treatment process shall be at any location from the point of determination to where the wastewater stream enters the treatment process. When samples are taken upstream of the treatment process and before wastewater streams have converged, the owner or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all affected wastewater is accounted for when using ยง 63.1256(g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii) or (g)(12) of this subpart to comply and that the mass flow rate of all wastewater, not just affected wastewater, is accounted for when using ยง 63.1256(g)(11) to comply, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section.
