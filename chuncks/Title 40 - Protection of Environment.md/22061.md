###### Calibration Gas.

7.1What calibration gases do I need? Refer to Section 7.1 of Method 7E for the calibration gas requirements. Example calibration gas mixtures are listed below. Pre-cleaned or scrubbed air may be used for the Ohigh-calibration gas provided it does not contain other gases that interfere with the Omeasurement.

(a) COin Nitrogen (N).

(b) CO/SOgas mixture in N.

(c) O/SOgas mixture in N.

(d) O/CO/SOgas mixture in N.

(e) CO/NOgas mixture in N.

(f) CO/SO/NOgas mixture in N.

The tests for analyzer calibration error and system bias require high-, mid-, and low-level gases.
