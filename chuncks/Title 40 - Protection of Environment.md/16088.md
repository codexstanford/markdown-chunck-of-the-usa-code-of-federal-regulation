####### Current operating information.

(c)A complete NSO application shall also contain the following information:

(1) A process flow diagram of the smelter, including current process and instrumentation diagrams for all processes or equipment which may emit or affect the emission of sulfur dioxide; the characteristics of all gas streams emitted from the smelter's process equipment (flow rates, temperature, volumes, compositions, and variations over time); and a list of all monitoring data and strip charts, including all data, charts, logs or sheets kept with respect to the operation of any process equipment which may emit or affect the emission of sulfur dioxide;

(2) The smelter's maximum daily production capacity (as defined in ยง 57.103(r)), the operational rate (in pounds of concentrate charged to the smelting furnace per hour) of each major piece of process equipment when the smelter is operating at that capacity; and the smelter's average and maximum daily production rate for each product, co-product, or by-product, by year, for the past four years;

(3) The optimal conversion efficiency (defined in terms of percent of total SOremoved from the input flow stream) of any acid plant or other sulfur dioxide control system under the normal process operating conditions (excluding malfunctions) most conducive to optimal conversion efficiency;

(4) The average conversion efficiency of any acid plant or other sulfur dioxide control system during normal process operations (excluding malfunctions), by month, during the past four years.

(5) The percent of the time the acid plant or other control system was available for service during each month for the past four years, excluding downtime for scheduled maintenance, and a full explanation of any major or recurring problems with the system during that time;

(6) The frequency and duration of times during the past four years when the SOsystem was unavailable because of scheduled maintenance of the system;

(7) A description of all scheduled, periodic, shutdowns of the smelter during the past four years, including their purpose, frequency and duration; and the same information with respect to unscheduled shutdowns;

(8) The gas volume, rates, and SOconcentration which the control system was actually designed to accommodate, taking into account any modifications made after its installation;

(9) The average monthly sulfur balance across the process and control equipment, including fugitive emissions, for the past 4 years; and

(10) A description of engineering techniques now in use at the smelter to prevent the release of fugitive emissions into the atmosphere at low elevations.
