####### Certification, Recertification, and Quality-Assurance Test Reporting Requirements.,i.e.,

11.4Except for daily QA tests (calibrations and flow monitor interference checks), which are included in each electronic quarterly emissions report, use the ECMPS Client Tool to submit the results of all required certification, recertification, quality-assurance, and diagnostic tests of the monitoring systems required under this appendix electronically. Submit the test results either prior to or concurrent with the relevant quarterly electronic emissions report. However, for RATAs of the HCl monitor, if this is not possible, you have up to 60 days after the test completion date to submit the test results; in this case, you may claim provisional status for the emissions data affected by the test, starting from the date and hour in which the test was completed and continuing until the date and hour in which the test results are submitted. If the test is successful, the status of the data in that time period changes from provisional to quality-assured, and no further action is required. However, if the test is unsuccessful, the provisional data must be invalidated and resubmission of the affected emission report(s) is required.

11.4.1 For each daily calibration drift (or calibration error) assessment (including daily calibration transfer standard tests), and for each 7-day calibration drift test of an HCl or HF monitor, report:

11.4.1.1 Facility ID information;

11.4.1.2 The monitoring component ID;

11.4.1.3 The instrument span and span scale;

11.4.1.4 For each gas injection, the date and time, the calibration gas level (zero, mid or other), the reference gas value (ppm), and the monitor response (ppm);

11.4.1.5 A flag to indicate whether dynamic spiking was used for the upscale value (extractive HCl monitors only);

11.4.1.6 Calibration drift or calibration error (percent of span or reference gas, as applicable);

11.4.1.7 When using the dynamic spiking option, the measured concentration of native HCl before and after each mid-level spike and the spiked gas dilution factor;

11.4.1.8 When using an IP-CEMS, also report the measured concentration of native HCl before and after each upscale measurement, the path lengths of the calibration cell and the stack optical path, the stack and calibration cell temperatures, the stack and calibration cell pressures, the instrument line strength factor, and the equivalent concentration of the reference gas; and

11.4.1.9 Reason for test (for the 7-day CD test, only).

11.4.2 For each quarterly gas audit of an HCl or HF CEMS that is following PS 15, report:

11.4.2.1 Facility ID information;

11.4.2.2 Monitoring system ID number;

11.4.2.3 Type of test (e.g., quarterly gas audit);

11.4.2.4 Reason for test;

11.4.2.5 Certified audit (spike) gas concentration value (ppm);

11.4.2.6 Measured value of audit (spike) gas, including date and time of injection;

11.4.2.7 Calculated dilution ratio for audit (spike) gas;

11.4.2.8 Date and time of each spiked flue gas sample;

11.4.2.9 Date and time of each unspiked flue gas sample;

11.4.2.10 The measured values for each spiked gas and unspiked flue gas sample (ppm);

11.4.2.11 The mean values of the spiked and unspiked sample concentrations and the expected value of the spiked concentration as specified in section 12.1 of Performance Specification 15 (ppm);

11.4.2.12 Bias at the spike level as calculated using equation 3 in section 12.1 of Performance Specification 15; and

11.4.2.13 The correction factor (CF), calculated using equation 6 in section 12.1 of Performance Specification 15.

11.4.3 For each RATA of a HCl or HF CEMS, report:

11.4.3.1 Facility ID information;

11.4.3.2 Monitoring system ID number;
