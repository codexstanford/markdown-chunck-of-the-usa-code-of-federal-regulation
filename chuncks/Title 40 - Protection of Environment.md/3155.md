(iii) The engine that is otherwise portable or transportable remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual operating period of the seasonal source. For purposes of this paragraph, a seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (, at least 2 years) and that operates at that single location approximately 3 months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.
