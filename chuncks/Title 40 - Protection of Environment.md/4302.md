###### Absorbing reagent,Caution:,10

8.1.2(0.04 M potassium tetrachloromercurate [TCM]): Dissolve 10.86 g mercuric chloride, 0.066 g EDTA, and 6.0 g potassium chloride in distilled water and dilute to volume with distilled water in a 1,000-mL volumetric flask. (Mercuric chloride is highly poisonous. If spilled on skin, flush with water immediately.) The pH of this reagent should be between 3.0 and 5.0 () Check the pH of the absorbing solution by using pH indicating paper or a pH meter. If the pH of the solution is not between 3.0 and 5.0, dispose of the solution according to one of the disposal techniques described in Section 13.0. The absorbing reagent is normally stable for 6 months. If a precipitate forms, dispose of the reagent according to one of the procedures described in Section 13.0.
