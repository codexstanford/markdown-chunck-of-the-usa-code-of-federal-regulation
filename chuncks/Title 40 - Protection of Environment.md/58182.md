###### ยง 152.85 Formulators' exemption.
####### Applicability of the formulators' exemption.

(b)(1) The formulators' exemption applies only to data concerning the purchased product or its ingredients. These data may include, but are not limited to, product chemistry, toxicology, residue chemistry, exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects.

(2) The data to which the formulators' exemption applies usually will concern the safety of one or more of the product's active ingredients, specifically, those active ingredients which are contained in the purchased product. In general, data for which the required test substance is the technical grade of the active ingredient, the pure active ingredient, the radiolabeled pure active ingredient, or a typical end-use product are eligible for the formulators' exemption.

(3) The formulators' exemption generally does not apply to data on the applicant's product itself, including the safety or efficacy of the product, unless the composition of the product is identical to the purchased product. In general, data for which the required test substance is the product proposed for registration are not eligible for the formulators' exemption.
