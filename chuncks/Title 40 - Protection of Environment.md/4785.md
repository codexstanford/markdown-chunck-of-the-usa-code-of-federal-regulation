(C) Sort all these daily maximum hourly values from a particular site and year by descending value. (For example: (x[1], x[2], x[3], * * *, x[n]). In this case, x[1] is the largest number and x[n] is the smallest value.) The 99th percentile is determined from this sorted series of daily values which is ordered from the highest to the lowest number. Using the left column of Table 1, determine the appropriate range (row) for the annual number of days with valid data for year y (cn). The corresponding "n" value in the right column identifies the rank of the annual 99th percentile value in the descending sorted list of daily site values for year y. Thus, P= the nth largest value.
