####### Engineering assessment.

(iii)For the purposes of determining continuous compliance with the emission rate limit specified in ยง 63.1405(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) using Equations 6 and 7, engineering assessments may be used to determine continuous process vent flow rate and organic HAP concentration. An engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:

(A) Previous test results, provided the tests are representative of current operating practices.

(B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process under representative operating conditions.

(C) Maximum volumetric flow rate or organic HAP concentration specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the continuous process vent.

(D) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to, the following:
