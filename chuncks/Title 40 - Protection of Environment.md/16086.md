###### ยง 57.202 How to apply.
####### Complete application.

(b)(1) Within the period referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the smelter owner shall submit its completed application pursuant to ยง 57.201. Receipt of all parts of a substantially complete application postmarked within the original or extended application period shall be deemed to continue the suspension of the SIP emission limitation for SOuntil the issuing agency issues or declines to issue an NSO. This suspension shall in all cases terminate, however, 90 days after receipt of the substantially completed application, unless extended for good cause at the discretion of the Administrator. If, in the Administrator's judgment, good faith effort has been made to submit a complete application, additional time may be granted to allow for correction of minor deficiencies.

(2) If an issuing agency transmits an NSO to EPA for approval before the expiration of the suspension of the Federal SIP emission limitation, the suspension shall continue until EPA approves or disapproves the NSO.
