####### Approval of construction or reconstruction.

(e)(1)(i) If the Administrator determines that, if properly constructed, or reconstructed, and operated, a new or existing source for which an application under paragraph (d) of this section was submitted will not cause emissions in violation of the relevant standard(s) and any other federally enforceable requirements, the Administrator will approve the construction or reconstruction.

(ii) In addition, in the case of reconstruction, the Administrator's determination under this paragraph will be based on:

(A) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new source;

(B) The estimated life of the source after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new source;

(C) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the source; and

(D) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with relevant standards that are inherent in the proposed replacements.

(2)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of construction or reconstruction within 60 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate an application submitted under paragraph (d) of this section. The 60-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.

(ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.

(3) Before denying any application for approval of construction or reconstruction, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial together with-

(i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and

(ii) Notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.

(4) A final determination to deny any application for approval will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 calendar days of presentation of additional information or arguments (if the application is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the final date specified for presentation if no presentation is made.

(5) Neither the submission of an application for approval nor the Administrator's approval of construction or reconstruction shall-

(i) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or

(ii) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
