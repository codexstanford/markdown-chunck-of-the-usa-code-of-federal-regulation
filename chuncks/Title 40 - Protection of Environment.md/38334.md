####### Special Considerations.

4.1.1.5.1A minimum of nine valid test runs must be performed, directly comparing the CEMS measurements to the reference method. More than nine test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, the results from a maximum of three test runs may be rejected so long as the total number of test results used to determine the relative accuracy is greater than or equal to nine; however, all data must be reported including the rejected data. The minimum time per run is 21 minutes if Method 30A is used. If Method 29, Method 30B, or ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008), "Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)" (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14) is used, the time per run must be long enough to collect a sufficient mass of Hg to analyze. Complete the RATA within 168 unit operating hours, except when Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 is used, in which case up to 336 operating hours may be taken to finish the test.
