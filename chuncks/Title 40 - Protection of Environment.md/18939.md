(vi) If the weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test.

(4) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that intermittently uses a capture system and a control device to comply with the emission limit specified in ยง 60.462(a)(4).

(i) Calculate the total volume of coating solids applied without the control device in operation (L) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(ii) Calculate the total volume of coating solids applied with the control device in operation (L) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(iii) Calculate the mass of VOC's used without the control device in operation (M+ M) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(iv) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied without the control device in operation (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(v) Calculate the mass of VOC's used with the control device in operation (M+ M) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(vi) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's used per unit volume of coating solids applied with the control device in operation (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(vii) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) or paragraphs (c)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, whichever is applicable.

(viii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the atmosphere (N) during each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(ix) Calculate the emission limit(s) for each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(x) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to the calculated emission limit (S) for the calendar month, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test.
