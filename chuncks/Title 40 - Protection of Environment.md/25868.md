() For determining debits from Group 1 process vents, recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and cannot be assigned a percent reduction in calculating EPV. The sampling site for measurement of uncontrolled emissions is after the final recovery device. However, as provided in ยง 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 process vent may add sufficient recovery to raise the TRE index value above 1.0, thereby becoming a Group 2 process vent.
