##### Subpart F - Recordkeeping Requirements
###### § 75.57 General recordkeeping provisions.
####### NO,emission record provisions.

(d)The owner or operator shall record the applicable information required by this paragraph for each affected unit for each hour or partial hour during which the unit operates, except for a gas-fired peaking unit or oil-fired peaking unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional protocol in appendix E to this part or a low mass emissions unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19(c) for estimating NOemission rate. For each NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured by a NO-diluent monitoring system, or, if applicable, for each NOconcentration (in ppm) measured by a NOconcentration monitoring system used to calculate NOmass emissions under § 75.71(a)(2), record the following data as measured and reported from the certified primary monitor, certified back-up monitor, or other approved method of emissions determination:

(1) Component-system identification code, as provided in § 75.53 (including identification code for the moisture monitoring system, if applicable);

(2) Date and hour;

(3) Hourly average NOconcentration (ppm, rounded to the nearest tenth) and hourly average NOconcentration (ppm, rounded to the nearest tenth) adjusted for bias if bias adjustment factor required, as provided in § 75.24(d);

(4) Hourly average diluent gas concentration (for NO-diluent monitoring systems, only, in units of percent Oor percent CO, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(5) If applicable, the hourly average moisture content of the stack gas (percent HO, rounded to the nearest tenth). If the continuous moisture monitoring system consists of wet- and dry-basis oxygen analyzers, also record both the hourly wet- and dry-basis oxygen readings (in percent O, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(6) Hourly average NOemission rate (for NO-diluent monitoring systems only, in units of lb/mmBtu, rounded to the nearest thousandth);

(7) Hourly average NOemission rate (for NO-diluent monitoring systems only, in units of lb/mmBtu, rounded to the nearest thousandth), adjusted for bias if bias adjustment factor is required, as provided in § 75.24(d). The requirement to report hourly NOemission rates to the nearest thousandth shall not affect NOcompliance determinations under part 76 of this chapter; compliance with each applicable emission limit under part 76 shall be determined to the nearest hundredth pound per million Btu;

(8) Percent monitoring system data availability (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent), for the NO-diluent or NOconcentration monitoring system, and, if applicable, for the moisture monitoring system, calculated pursuant to § 75.32;

(9) Method of determination for hourly average NOemission rate or NOconcentration and (if applicable) for the hourly average moisture percentage, using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of this section; and

(10) Identification codes for emissions formulas used to derive hourly average NOemission rate and total NOmass emissions, as provided in § 75.53, and (if applicable) the F-factor used to convert NOconcentrations into emission rates.
