###### ยง 600.114-12 Vehicle-specific 5-cycle fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission calculations.
####### Highway CO,emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions.

(e)(1) For each vehicle tested, determine the 5-cycle highway carbon-related exhaust emissions using the following equation:

(2) If the condition specified in ยง 600.115-08(b)(2)(iii)(B) is met, in lieu of using the calculation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the manufacturer may optionally determine the highway carbon-related exhaust emissions using the following modified 5-cycle equation which utilizes data from FTP, HFET, and US06 tests, and applies mathematic adjustments for Cold FTP and SC03 conditions:

(i) Perform a US06 test in addition to the FTP and HFET tests.

(ii) Determine the 5-cycle highway carbon-related exhaust emissions according to the following formula:

(3) To determine the Highway COemissions, use the appropriate COgrams/mile values instead of CREE values in the equations in this paragraph (e).

(4) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (e) are defined as follows:
