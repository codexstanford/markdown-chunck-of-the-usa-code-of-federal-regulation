####### Determination if pressure decay curves are similar.

(h)The owner or operator shall determine the pressure decay curve as defined in ยง 63.1423. Products with similar pressure decay curves constitute a product class. To determine if two pressure decay curves are similar when the pressure decay curves for products have different starting and finishing pressures, the owner or operator shall determine the time when the pressure has fallen to half its total pressure by using Equation 13:
