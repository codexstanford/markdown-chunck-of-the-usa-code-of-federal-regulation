####### Plant site

means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof. A unit or group of units within a contiguous property that are not under common control (e.g., a wastewater treatment unit or solvent recovery unit located at the site but is sold to a different company) is a different plant site.
