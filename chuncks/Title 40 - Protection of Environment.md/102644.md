####### ยง 1065.230 Raw exhaust flow meter.
######## Application.

(a)You may use measured raw exhaust flow, as follows:

(1) Use the actual value of calculated raw exhaust in the following cases:

(i) Multiply raw exhaust flow rate with continuously sampled concentrations.

(ii) Multiply total raw exhaust with batch sampled concentrations.

(2) In the following cases, you may use a raw exhaust flow meter signal that does not give the actual value of raw exhaust, as long as it is linearly proportional to the exhaust flow rate's actual calculated value:

(i) For feedback control of a proportional sampling system, such as a partial-flow dilution system.

(ii) For multiplying with continuously sampled gas concentrations, if the same signal is used in a chemical-balance calculation to determine work from brake-specific fuel consumption and fuel consumed.
