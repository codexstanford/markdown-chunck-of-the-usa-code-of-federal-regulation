####### Test data report

(2)-(i) Phase 2 Screening Test under paragraph (c) of this section. (A) Report the initial molar concentration of test chemical, C, in pure water and SHW for each replicate and the mean value.

(B) Report the molar concentration of test chemical, C, in pure water and SHW for each replicate and the mean value for each time point t.

(C) Report the molar concentration of test chemical for each replicate control sample and the mean value for each time point.

(D) Report the values of (k)and (k)for the time point t in which the fraction of test chemical photoreacted is in the range 20 to 80 percent.

(E) If small losses of test chemical were observed in SHW and pure water, report a first-order rate constant loss, (k). Calculate and report (k)for SHW and/or pure water. Calculate and report the corrected first-order rate constant for SHW and/or pure water using the relationship expressed in Equation 24:
