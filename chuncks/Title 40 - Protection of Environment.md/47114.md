####### Component description, CFV-EFC-CVS.

(d)The CVS sample system is identical to the system described in paragraph (c) of this section, plus includes a means of electronically measuring the CVS flow rate, and electronic mass flow controllers for the methanol and formaldehyde sample lines, and separate flow meters to totalize sample flow volumes (optional). The EFC sample system shall conform to all of the requirements listed in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the methanol and formaldehyde samples mat both be drawn from a single static probe. It also must comply with the following additional requirements:

(1) The ratio of the CVS flow rate to the sample flow rate shall not deviate from the ratio at the start of the test by more than +/-5 percent. (The volumetric sample flow rate shall be varied inversely with the square root of the bulk stream temperature.)

(2) Flow totalizers for methanol and/or formaldehyde samples shall have an accuracy of +/-2 percent. Total sample volumes may be obtained from the flow controllers, with the advance approval of the administrator, provided that the controllers can be shown to have an accuracy of +/-2 percent.
