####### Determination of Attainment.

(c)Effective March 18, 2008, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.

(d) Approval-Revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on May 28, 2008. This revision establishes Year 2009 motor vehicle emission budgets of 15.31 tons per summer day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 28.53 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides (NO) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.
