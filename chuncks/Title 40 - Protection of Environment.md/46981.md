####### Migration to 40 CFR parts 1065 and 1066.

(b)This subpart transitions to rely on the test procedure specifications in 40 CFR parts 1065 and 1066 as follows:

(1) Through model year 2021, manufacturers may use the test procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or, using good engineering judgement, elements of both. For any EPA testing before model year 2022, EPA will use the manufacturer's selected procedures for applying acceptable speed-tolerance criteria. For any other parameters, EPA may conduct testing using either of the specified procedures. As allowed under this part, manufacturers may use carryover data from previous model years to demonstrate compliance with emission standards, without regard to the provisions of this section.

(2) For vehicles certified before model year 2022 to any of the Tier 3 emission standards specified in subpart S of this part, manufacturers must determine overall driver accuracy based on driven cycle energy as described in 40 CFR 1066.425(j).
