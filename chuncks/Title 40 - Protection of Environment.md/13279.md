####### Approval

(c)-The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for the New Orleans CMSA on April 23, 1993. The EPA deemed this request complete on September 10, 1993. Several approvability issues existed, however. The LDEQ addressed these approvability issues in a supplemental ozone redesignation request and revised maintenance plan. This supplemental submittal was received on October 14, 1994. The redesignation request and maintenance plans meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Louisiana ozone State Implementation Plan for Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, and St. Charles Parishes. The EPA therefore approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to ozone for 7Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, and St. Charles Parishes on December 1, 1995.
