####### Off-site material stream

means an off-site material produced or generated by a particular process or source such that the composition and form of the material comprising the stream remain consistent. An off-site material stream may be delivered, transferred, or otherwise moved to the plant site in a continuous flow of material (e.g., wastewater flowing through a pipeline) or in a series of discrete batches of material (e.g., a truckload of drums all containing the same off-site material or multiple bulk truck loads of an off-site material produced by the same process).
