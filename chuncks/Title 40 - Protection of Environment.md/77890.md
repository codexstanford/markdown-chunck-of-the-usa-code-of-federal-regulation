####### Content of pre-model year reports.

(b)(1) Each pre-model year report must include the following information for each compliance category for the applicable future model year and to the extent possible, two model years into the future:

(i) The manufacturer's estimate of its footprint-based fleet average COstandards (including temporary lead time allowance alternative standards, if applicable);

(ii) Projected total and model-level production volumes for each applicable standard category;

(iii) Projected fleet average COcompliance level for each applicable standard category; and the model-level COemission values which form the basis of the projection;

(iv) Projected fleet average COcredit/debit status for each applicable standard category;

(v) A description of the various credit, transfer and trading options that will be used to comply with each applicable standard category, including the amount of credit the manufacturer intends to generate for air conditioning leakage, air conditioning efficiency, off-cycle technology, advanced technology vehicles, hybrid or low-emission full size pickup trucks, and various early credit programs;

(vi) A description of the method which will be used to calculate the carbon-related exhaust emissions for any electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles;

(vii) A summary by model year (beginning with the 2009 model year) of the number of electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, dedicated compressed natural gas vehicles, and dual fuel natural gas vehicles using (or projected to use) the advanced technology vehicle credit and incentives program, including the projected use of production multipliers;

(viii) The methodology which will be used to comply with NO and CHemission standards; and

(ix) Notification of the manufacturer's intent to exclude emergency vehicles from the calculation of fleet average standards and the end-of-year fleet average, including a description of the excluded emergency vehicles and the quantity of such vehicles excluded.

(x) Other information requested by the Administrator.

(2) Manufacturers must submit, in the pre-model year report for each model year in which a credit deficit is generated (or projected to be generated), a compliance plan demonstrating how the manufacturer will comply with the fleet average COstandard by the end of the third year after the deficit occurred.
