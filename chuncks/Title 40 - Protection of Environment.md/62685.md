###### Condition 3: § 194.24: Waste Characterization.

The Secretary may allow shipment for disposal at the WIPP of legacy debris waste at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ("LANL") that can be characterized using the systems and processes inspected by the Agency and documented in Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-70. The Secretary shall not allow shipment of any waste from any additional LANL waste stream(s) or from any waste generator site other than LANL for disposal at the WIPP until the Agency has approved the processes for characterizing those waste streams for shipment using the process set forth in § 194.8.

(a) Not later than the final recertification application submitted prior to closure of the disposal system, the Department shall provide, to the Administrator or the Administrator's authorized representative:

(1) a schedule for implementing passive institutional controls that has been revised to show that markers will be fabricated and emplaced, and other measures will be implemented, as soon as possible following closure of the WIPP. Such schedule should describe how testing of any aspect of the conceptual design will be completed prior to or soon after closure, and what changes to the design of passive institutional controls may be expected to result from such testing.

(2) documentation showing that the granite pieces for the proposed monuments and information rooms described in Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-1, and supplementary information may be: quarried (cut and removed from the ground) without cracking due to tensile stresses from handling or isostatic rebound; engraved on the scale required by the design; transported to the site, given the weight and dimensions of the granite pieces and the capacity of existing rail cars and rail lines; loaded, unloaded, and erected without cracking based on the capacity of available equipment; and successfully joined.

(3) documentation showing that archives and record centers will accept the documents identified and will maintain them in the manner identified in Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-1.

(4) documentation showing that proposed recipients of WIPP information other than archives and record centers will accept the information and make use of it in the manner indicated by the Department in Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-1 and supplementary information.

(b) Upon receipt of the information required under paragraph (a) of this condition, the Agency will place such documentation in the public dockets identified in § 194.67. The Agency will determine if a modification to the compliance certification in effect is necessary. Any such modification will be conducted in accordance with the requirements at §§ 194.65 and 194.66.
