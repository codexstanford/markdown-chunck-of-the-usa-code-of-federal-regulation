As shown in Example 1, this site meets the primary and secondary ONAAQS because the 3-year average of the annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentrations (0.065666 ppm, truncated to 0.065 ppm) is less than or equal to 0.070 ppm. The minimum data completeness requirements are also met (design value is considered valid) because the average percent of days within the Omonitoring season with valid ambient monitoring data is greater than 90%, and no single year has less than 75% data completeness.
