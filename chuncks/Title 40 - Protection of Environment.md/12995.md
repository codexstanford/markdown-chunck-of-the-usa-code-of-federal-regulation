(i)(A) Letter dated March 24, 1986, from Harry D. Williams, Director, Air Pollution Control Division, Indiana State Board of Health. Letter dated April 14, 1986, from Walter J. Kulakowski, Assistant Commissioner for Air Management, Department of Environmental Management.

(60) On January 18, 1984, Indiana submitted as a revision to the TSP SIP certain operating conditions and limits for three coke oven batteries at Citizens Gas and Coke Utility in Marion County. The operating permits included conditions and limits for Batteries E, H and Number One with respect to visible emissions from coke oven doors and pushing operations and allowable content of total dissolved solids in quench makeup water. EPA disapproves the limit on coke oven door visible emissions and total dissolved solids content for quench makeup water on Battery Number One, because the limits are inconsistent with that battery's Part C Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements and Part D Lowest Achievable Emission Rate requirements. See subparagraphs (c)(34) and (c)(42) for further background on actions concerning coke oven batteries.
