###### Final adjusted velocity pressure.

8.7.2.3Calculate the final adjusted velocity pressure (Î”p) using Equation 27. (Figures 8 and 9 of Section 17 illustrate that the blockage effect of the combined PM, PMcyclone sampling head, and pitot tube increases rapidly below stack diameters of 26.5 inches. Therefore, the combined PM, PMfilter sampling head and pitot tube is not applicable for stacks with a diameter less than 26.5 inches because the blockage is greater than six percent. For stacks with a diameter less than 26.5 inches, PMparticulate measurements may be possible using only a PMcyclone, pitot tube, and in-stack filter. If the blockage exceeds three percent but is less than six percent, you must follow the procedures outlined in Method 1A of appendix A-1 to part 60 to conduct tests. You must conduct the velocity traverse downstream of the sampling location or immediately before the test run.
