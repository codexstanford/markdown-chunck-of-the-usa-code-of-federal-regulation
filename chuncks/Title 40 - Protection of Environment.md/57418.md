###### ยง 146.68 Testing and monitoring requirements.
####### Ambient monitoring.

(e)(1) Based on a site-specific assessment of the potential for fluid movement from the well or injection zone, and on the potential value of monitoring wells to detect such movement, the Director shall require the owner or operator to develop a monitoring program. At a minimum, the Director shall require monitoring of the pressure buildup in the injection zone annually, including at a minimum, a shut down of the well for a time sufficient to conduct a valid observation of the pressure fall-off curve.

(2) When prescribing a monitoring system the Director may also require:

(i) Continuous monitoring for pressure changes in the first aquifer overlying the confining zone. When such a well is installed, the owner or operator shall, on a quarterly basis, sample the aquifer and analyze for constituents specified by the Director;

(ii) The use of indirect, geophysical techniques to determine the position of the waste front, the water quality in a formation designated by the Director, or to provide other site specific data;

(iii) Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality in the first aquifer overlying the injection zone;

(iv) Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality in the lowermost USDW; and

(v) Any additional monitoring necessary to determine whether fluids are moving into or between USDWs.

(f) The Director may require seismicity monitoring when he has reason to believe that the injection activity may have the capacity to cause seismic disturbances.
