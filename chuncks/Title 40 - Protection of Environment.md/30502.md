####### Individual drain system

means the stationary system used to convey wastewater streams or residuals to a waste management unit. The term includes hard piping; all process drains and junction boxes; and associated sewer lines, other junction boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations conveying wastewater streams or residuals. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other individual drain systems, is excluded from this definition.
