####### ยง 1065.1145 Execution of accelerated aging, cycle tracking, and cycle validation criteria.
######## Changing engine oil.

(i)For an engine-based platform, periodically change engine oil to maintain stable oil consumption rates and maintain the health of the aging engine. Interrupt aging as needed to perform oil changes. Perform a drain-and-weigh measurement. Following an oil change you must run at least 4 hours with the exhaust bypassing the aftertreatment system to stabilize the new oil. If you see a sudden change in oil consumption it may be necessary to stop aging and either change oil or correct an issue with the accelerated oil consumption. If the aging engine requires repairs to correct an oil consumption issue in the middle of aging, you must re-validate the oil consumption rate for 72 hours before you continue aging. The engine exhaust should be left bypassing the aftertreatment system until the repaired engine has been validated.
