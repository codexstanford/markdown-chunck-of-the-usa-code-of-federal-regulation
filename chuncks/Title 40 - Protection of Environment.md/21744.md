###### ยง 60.5432a How do I determine whether a well is a low pressure well using the low pressure well equation?
####### P,psia,F,X,X,X

(10) Calculate the critical pressure, P(psia), and critical temperature, T(R), using the equations below with: Gas gravity at standard conditions (pressure,= 14.7 (), temperature, T = 60 ()), &#x3B3; = 0.75; and where the mole fractions of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in the gas are= 0.168225,= 0.013163, and= 0.013680, respectively:
