####### Heavy metals standard.

(d)RFG or RBOB must not contain any heavy metals, including but not limited to lead or manganese. EPA may waive this prohibition for a heavy metal (other than lead) if EPA determines that addition of the heavy metal to the gasoline will not increase, on an aggregate mass or cancer-risk basis, toxic air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles.
