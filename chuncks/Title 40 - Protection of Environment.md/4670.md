####### Primary monitors

are suitable monitors designated by a state or local agency in their annual network plan (and in AQS) as the default data source for creating a combined site record for purposes of NAAQS comparisons. If there is only one suitable monitor at a particular site location, then it is presumed to be a primary monitor.
