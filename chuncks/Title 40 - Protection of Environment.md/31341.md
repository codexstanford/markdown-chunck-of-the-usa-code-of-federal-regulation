###### § 63.1325 Batch process vents - performance test methods and procedures to determine compliance.
####### Batch mass input limitation.

(g)The batch mass input limitation required by § 63.1322(g)(1) shall be determined by the owner or operator such that annual emissions for the batch process vent remain less than the level specified in § 63.1323(d). The batch mass input limitation required by § 63.1322(f)(1) shall be determined by the owner or operator such that annual emissions remain at a level that ensures that said batch process vent remains a Group 2 batch process vent, given the actual annual flow rate for said batch process vent determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.1323(e)(3). The batch mass input limitation shall be determined using the same basis, as described in § 63.1323(a)(1), used to make the group determination (i.e., expected mix of products or highest-HAP recipe.) The establishment of the batch mass input limitation is not dependent upon any past production or activity level.

(1) If the expected mix of products serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based on any foreseeable combination of products that the owner or operator expects to manufacture.

(2) If the single highest-HAP recipe serves as the basis for the batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be determined based solely on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation.
