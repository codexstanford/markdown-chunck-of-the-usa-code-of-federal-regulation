####### Control requirements.

(i)The owner or operator shall comply with the control requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (e)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) During periods when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of this subpart.

(B) During periods when the PMPU produces products other than polyether polyols, the owner or operator is not required to install additional combustion, recovery, or recapture devices (to otherwise demonstrate compliance). However, the owner or operator shall continue to operate any existing combustion, recovery, or recapture devices that are required for compliance during the production of polyether polyols, with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. If extended cookout (ECO) is the control technique chosen for epoxide emission reduction, then ECO or a control technique providing an equivalent reduction in epoxide emissions should continue to be used for epoxide emission reduction, if the non-polyether polyol being produced uses epoxide monomers.
