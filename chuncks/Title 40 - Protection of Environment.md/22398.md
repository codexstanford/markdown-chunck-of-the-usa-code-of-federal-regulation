###### 13.17 IDC-Lowest calibration concentration, Demonstration of precision, Demonstration of accuracy

.

13.17.1 Lowest calibration concentration. The Upper PIR Limit must be less than, or equal, to 150%; and the Lower PIR Limit must be greater than, or equal to, 50%. If these criteria are not met, the lowest calibration point has been set too low and must be confirmed at a higher concentration.

13.17.2 Demonstration of precision. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) of the concentrations from the replicate analyses must be less than 20% for all target analytes. Demonstration would be repeated for failed compounds only.

13.17.3 Demonstration of accuracy. The average % recovery for each target analyte must be within 70 to 130%. Demonstration would be repeated for failed compounds only.
