###### ยง 86.1864-10 How to comply with the fleet average cold temperature NMHC standards.
####### Calculating the fleet average cold temperature NMHC standard.

(m)Manufacturers must compute separate sales-weighted fleet average cold temperature NMHC emissions at the end of the model year for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, using actual sales, and certifying test groups to FELs, as defined in ยง 86.1803-01. The FEL becomes the standard for each test group, and every test group can have a different FEL. The certification resolution for the FEL will be 0.1 grams/mile. LDVs and LLDTs must be grouped together when calculating the fleet average, and HLDTs and MDPVs must also be grouped together to determine the fleet average. Manufacturers must compute the sales-weighted cold temperature NMHC fleet averages using the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile:
