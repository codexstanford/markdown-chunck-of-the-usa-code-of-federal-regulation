###### Fossil fuel-fired steam generators.

2.1Each fossil fuel-fired steam generator, except as provided in the following subparagraphs, with an annual average capacity factor of greater than 30 percent, as reported to the Federal Power Commission for calendar year 1974, or as otherwise demonstrated to the State by the owner or operator, shall conform with the following monitoring requirements when such facility is subject to an emission standard of an applicable plan for the pollutant in question.

2.1.1 A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of opacity which meets the performance specifications of paragraph 3.1.1 of this appendix shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated in accordance with the procedures of this appendix by the owner or operator of any such steam generator of greater than 250 million BTU per hour heat input except where:

2.1.1.1 gaseous fuel is the only fuel burned, or

2.1.1.2 oil or a mixture of gas and oil are the only fuels burned and the source is able to comply with the applicable particulate matter and opacity regulations without utilization of particulate matter collection equipment, and where the source has never been found, through any administrative or judicial proceedings, to be in violation of any visible emission standard of the applicable plan.

2.1.2 A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur dioxide which meets the performance specifications of paragraph 3.1.3 of this appendix shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated on any fossil fuel-fired steam generator of greater than 250 million BTU per hour heat input which has installed sulfur dioxide pollutant control equipment.

2.1.3 A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of nitrogen oxides which meets the performance specification of paragraph 3.1.2 of this appendix shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated on fossil fuel-fired steam generators of greater than 1000 million BTU per hour heat input when such facility is located in an Air Quality Control Region where the Administrator has specifically determined that a control strategy for nitrogen dioxide is necessary to attain the national standards, unless the source owner or operator demonstrates during source compliance tests as required by the State that such a source emits nitrogen oxides at levels 30 percent or more below the emission standard within the applicable plan.

2.1.4 A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the percent oxygen or carbon dioxide which meets the performance specifications of paragraphs 3.1.4 or 3.1.5 of this appendix shall be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained on fossil fuel-fired steam generators where measurements of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the flue gas are required to convert either sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides continuous emission monitoring data, or both, to units of the emission standard within the applicable plan.
