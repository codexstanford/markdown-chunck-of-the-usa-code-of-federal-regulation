####### Conversion model year

means the clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturer's annual production period which includes January 1 of such calendar year. A specific model year may not include January 1 from the previous year or the following year. This is based on the expectation that production periods generally run on consistent schedules from year to year. Conversion model years may not circumvent or skip an annual production period. The term conversion model year means the calendar year if the converter does not have a different annual production period.
