###### Principle:

An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of some other chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquid scintillation "cocktail" which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to establish a channel or "window" for the pulse energy appropriate to the nuclide of interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the counting rate in the appropriate energy channel. Corrections are made for chemical yield where separations are made.
