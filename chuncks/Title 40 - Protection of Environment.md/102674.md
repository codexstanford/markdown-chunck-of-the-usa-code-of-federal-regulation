####### ยง 1065.266 Fourier transform infrared analyzer.
######## Application.

(a)For engines that run only on natural gas, you may use a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyzer to measure nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and nonmethane-nonethane hydrocarbon (NMNEHC) for continuous sampling. You may use an FTIR analyzer with any gaseous-fueled engine, including dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines, to measure CHand CH, for either batch or continuous sampling (for subtraction from THC).
