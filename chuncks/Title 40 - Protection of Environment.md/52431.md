####### e.g.,

(vi) Absorbent type (triethylene glycol (TEG), diethylene glycol (DEG) or ethylene glycol (EG)).

(vii) Use of stripping gas.

(viii) Use of flash tank separator (and disposition of recovered gas).

(ix) Hours operated.

(x) Wet natural gas temperature and pressure.

(xi) Wet natural gas composition. Determine this parameter using one of the methods described in paragraphs (e)(1)(xi)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) Use the GHG mole fraction as defined in paragraph (u)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(B) If the GHG mole fraction cannot be determined using paragraph (u)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, select a representative analysis.

(C) You may use an appropriate standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization if such a method exists or you may use an industry standard practice as specified in ยง 98.234(b) to sample and analyze wet natural gas composition.

(D) If only composition data for dry natural gas is available, assume the wet natural gas is saturated.
