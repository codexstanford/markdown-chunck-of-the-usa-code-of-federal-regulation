######## Vacuum-decay leak test.
########## Exceptions.

(e)The following exceptions apply:

(1) You may omit this verification if you can show by engineering analysis that for your CO sampling system and your emission-calculation procedures, the combined COand HO interference for your CO NDIR analyzer always affects your brake-specific CO emission results within +/-0.5% of the applicable CO standard.

(2) You may use a CO NDIR analyzer that you determine does not meet this verification, as long as you try to correct the problem and the measurement deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to show that engines comply with all applicable emission standards.
