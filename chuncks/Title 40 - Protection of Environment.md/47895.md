() A multiplicative DF will be calculated by taking the ratio of the full or intermediate useful life mileage level, as appropriate (rounded to four decimal places), divided by the stabilized mileage (reference ยง 86.1831-01(c), e.g., 4000-mile) level (rounded to four decimal places) from the regression analysis; the result shall be rounded to three-decimal places of accuracy. The rounding required in this paragraph shall be conducted in accordance with the Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with Specifications (incorporated by reference, see ยง 86.1). Calculated DF values of less than one shall be changed to one for the purposes of this paragraph.
