####### Collector sewer.

(10)The common lateral sewers, within a publicly owned treatment system, which are primarily installed to receive wastewaters directly from facilities which convey wastewater from individual systems, or from private property, and which include service "Y" connections designed for connection with those facilities including:

(i) Crossover sewers connecting more than one property on one side of a major street, road, or highway to a lateral sewer on the other side when more cost effective than parallel sewers; and

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(10)(iii) of this section, pumping units and pressurized lines serving individual structures or groups of structures when such units are cost effective and are owned and maintained by the grantee.

(iii) This definition excludes other facilities which convey wastewater from individual structures, from private property to the public lateral sewer, or its equivalent and also excludes facilities associated with alternatives to conventional treatment works in small communities.
