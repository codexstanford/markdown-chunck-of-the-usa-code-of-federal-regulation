####### Partial pressures in multicomponent systems.

(9)Individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems shall be determined using the appropriate method specified in paragraphs (d)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) If the components are miscible, use Raoult's law to calculate the partial pressures;

(ii) If the solution is a dilute aqueous mixture, use Henry's law constants to calculate partial pressures;

(iii) If Raoult's law or Henry's law is not appropriate or available, the owner or operator may use any of the options in paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.

(A) Experimentally obtained activity coefficients, Henry's law constants, or solubility data;

(B) Models, such as group-contribution models, to predict activity coefficients; or

(C) Assume the components of the system behave independently and use the summation of all vapor pressures from the HAPs as the total HAP partial pressure.

(10) For continuous process vent emissions determined by engineering assessment, the engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the examples provided in ยง 63.1412(k)(3).
