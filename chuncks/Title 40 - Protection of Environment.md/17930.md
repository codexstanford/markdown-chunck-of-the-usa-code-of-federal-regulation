###### § 60.59b Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
####### i.e.

(7) Identification of each occurrence that sulfur dioxide emissions data, nitrogen oxides emissions data, particulate matter emissions data, cadmium emissions data, lead emissions data, mercury emissions data, hydrogen chloride emissions data, or dioxin/furan emissions data (for owners and operators who elect to continuously monitor particulate matter, cadmium, lead, mercury, or hydrogen chloride, or who elect to use continuous automated sampling systems for dioxin/furan or mercury emissions, instead of conducting performance testing using EPA manual test methods) or operational data (, carbon monoxide emissions, unit load, and particulate matter control device temperature) have been excluded from the calculation of average emission concentrations or parameters, and the reasons for excluding the data.

(8) The results of daily drift tests and quarterly accuracy determinations for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as required under appendix F of this part, procedure 1.

(9) The test reports documenting the results of the initial performance test and all annual performance tests listed in paragraphs (d)(9)(i) and (d)(9)(ii) of this section shall be recorded along with supporting calculations.

(i) The results of the initial performance test and all annual performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the particulate matter, opacity, cadmium, lead, mercury, dioxins/furans, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash emission limits.

(ii) For the initial dioxin/furan performance test and all subsequent dioxin/furan performance tests recorded under paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section, the maximum demonstrated municipal waste combustor unit load and maximum demonstrated particulate matter control device temperature (for each particulate matter control device).

(10) An owner or operator who elects to continuously monitor emissions instead of performance testing by EPA manual methods must maintain records specified in paragraphs (10)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) For owners and operators who elect to continuously monitor particulate matter instead of conducting performance testing using EPA manual test methods), as required under appendix F of this part, procedure 2, the results of daily drift tests and quarterly accuracy determinations for particulate matter.

(ii) For owners and operators who elect to continuously monitor cadmium, lead, mercury, or hydrogen chloride instead of conducting EPA manual test methods, the results of all quality evaluations, such as daily drift tests and periodic accuracy determinations, specified in the approved site-specific performance evaluation test plan required by § 60.58b(o)(5).

(iii) For owners and operators who elect to use continuous automated sampling systems for dioxin/furan or mercury, the results of all quality evaluations specified in the approved site-specific performance evaluation test plan required by § 60.58b(q)(5).

(11) For each affected facility subject to the siting provisions under § 60.57b, the siting analysis, the final materials separation plan, a record of the location and date of the public meetings, and the documentation of the responses to public comments received at the public meetings.

(12) The records specified in paragraphs (d)(12)(i) through (d)(12)(iv) of this section.

(i) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have been provisionally certified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers or an equivalent State-approved certification program as required by § 60.54b(a) including the dates of initial and renewal certifications and documentation of current certification.

(ii) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have been fully certified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers or an equivalent State-approved certification program as required by § 60.54b(b) including the dates of initial and renewal certifications and documentation of current certification.

(iii) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have completed the EPA municipal waste combustor operator training course or a State-approved equivalent course as required by § 60.54b(d) including documentation of training completion.

(iv) Records of when a certified operator is temporarily off site. Include two main items:

(A) If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is on site, record the dates that the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor were off site.

(B) When all certified chief facility operators and certified shift supervisors are off site for more than 2 weeks and no other certified operator is on site, keep records of four items:
