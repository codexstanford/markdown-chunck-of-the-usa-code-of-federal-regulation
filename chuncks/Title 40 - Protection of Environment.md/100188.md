(5) For Phase 2 testing, determine separate values offor at least one high-roof day cab and one high-roof sleeper cab for model year 2021, for at least two high-roof day cabs and two high-roof sleeper cabs for model year 2024, and for at least three high-roof day cabs and three high-roof sleeper cabs for model year 2027. These test requirements are cumulative; for example, you may meet these requirements by testing two vehicles to support model year 2021 certification and four additional vehicles to support model year 2023 certification. For any untested tractor models, apply the value offrom the tested tractor model that best represents the aerodynamic characteristics of the untested tractor model, consistent with good engineering judgment. Testing under this paragraph (b)(5) continues to be valid for later model years until you change the tractor model in a way that causes the test results to no longer represent production vehicles. You must also determine unique values offor low-roof and mid-roof tractors if you determinevalues based on low or mid-roof tractor testing as shown in Table 4 of ยง 1037.520. For Phase 1 testing, if good engineering judgment allows it, you may calculate a single, constant value offor your whole product line by dividing the coastdown drag area,, by drag area from your alternate method,.
