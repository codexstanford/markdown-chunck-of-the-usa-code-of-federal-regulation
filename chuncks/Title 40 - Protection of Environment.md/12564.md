####### Printing and publishing,Flexographic and rotogravure printing.

(h)-(1)(i) No owner or operator of a subject flexographic, packaging rotogravure or publication rotogravure printing line shall apply at any time any coating or ink unless the VOM content does not exceed the limitation specified in either paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Compliance with this paragraph must be demonstrated through the applicable coating or ink analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section. As an alternative to compliance with paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, a subject printing line may meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section.

(A) Forty percent VOM by volume of the coating and ink (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM), or

(B) Twenty-five percent VOM by volume of the volatile content in the coating and ink.

(ii) No owner or operator of a subject flexographic, packaging rotogravure or publication rotogravure printing line shall apply coatings or inks on the subject printing line unless the weighted average, by volume, VOM content of all coatings and inks as applied each day on the subject printing line does not exceed the limitation specified in either paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) (as determined by paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) or (h)(1)(i)(B) (as determined by paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Compliance with this paragraph must be demonstrated through the applicable coating or ink analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section.

(A) The following equation shall be used to determine if the weighted average VOM content of all coatings and inks as applied each day on the subject printing line exceeds the limitation specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

(B) The following equation shall be used to determine if the weighted average VOM content of all coatings and inks as applied each day on the subject printing line exceeds the limitation specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(iii) No owner or operator of a subject flexographic, packaging rotogravure or publication rotogravure printing line equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject printing line unless the owner or operator meets the requirements in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) (A), (B) or (C) and paragraphs (h)(1)(iii) (D), (E) and (F) of this section.

(A) A carbon adsorption system is used which reduces the captured VOM emissions by at least 90 percent by weight, or

(B) An incineration system is used which reduces the captured VOM emissions by at least 90 percent by weight, or

(C) An alternative VOM emission reduction system is demonstrated to have at least a 90 percent control device efficiency and the alternative emission reduction system is approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revisions, and

(D) The printing line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides an overall reduction in VOM emissions of at least:
