(1) Determine fuel consumption by calculating the mass of fuel for each test in grams,without rounding, as described in 40 CFR 1036.540(d)(12) for both the conventional vehicle and the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting portions of the test for the hybrid vehicle as applicable.

(2) Divide the fuel mass by the applicable distance determined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and the appropriate standard payload as defined in ยง 1037.801 to determine the fuel-consumption rate in g/ton-mile.

(3) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles calculate the utility factor weighted fuel-consumption rate in g/ton-mile, as follows:

(i) Determine the utility factor fraction for the PTO system from the table in appendix E of this part using interpolation based on the total time of the charge-depleting portion of the test as determined in paragraphs (c)(6) and (d)(3) of this section.
