Evaluate background contamination from glassware, equipment, solvents, standards, and media used for sample batches using an LMB prepared and analyzed identically to the field samples, including the same labeled standards, media, sodium sulfate, glass wool, glassware, solvents, etc. An LMB must be extracted with every batch of samples. Analyze an LMB at least once during each analytical sequence or every 12 hours, whichever period is shorter. If multiple LMB are required for an analytical sequence, report the initial LMB associated with each 12 hour analysis period.
