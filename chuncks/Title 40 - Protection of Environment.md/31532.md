###### Emission Standards and Operating Limits
####### § 63.1348 Compliance requirements.
######## Total Organic HAP Emissions Tests.

(ii)If you elect to demonstrate compliance with the total organic HAP emissions limit under § 63.1343(b) in lieu of the THC emissions limit, you must demonstrate compliance with the total organic HAP emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(7).

(iii) If you are demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct the separate performance tests as specified in § 63.1349(b)(7) while the raw mill of the inline kiln/raw mill is operating and while the raw mill of the inline kiln/raw mill is not operating.

(iv) The time weighted average total organic HAP concentration measured during the separate initial performance test specified by § 63.1349(b)(7) must be used to determine initial compliance.

(v) The time weighted average THC concentration measured during the initial performance test specified by § 63.1349(b)(4) must be used to determine the site-specific THC limit. Using the fraction of time the inline kiln/raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the inline kiln/raw mill is off, calculate this limit as a time weighted average of the THC levels measured during raw mill on and raw mill off testing using one of the two approaches in § 63.1349(b)(7)(vii) or (viii) depending on the level of organic HAP measured during the compliance test.
