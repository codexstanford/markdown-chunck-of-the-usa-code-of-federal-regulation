###### § 268.34 Waste specific prohibitions - toxicity characteristic metal wastes.
####### i.e.

(d) Between May 26, 1998 and May 26, 2000, newly identified characteristic wastes from elemental phosphorus processing, radioactive waste mixed with D004-D011 wastes that are newly identified (, wastes, soil, or debris identified as hazardous by the Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure but not the Extraction Procedure), or mixed with newly identified characteristic mineral processing wastes, soil, or debris may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if such unit is in compliance with the requirements specified in § 268.5(h) of this part.

(e) The requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply if:

(1) The wastes meet the applicable treatment standards specified in subpart D of this part:

(2) Persons have been granted an exemption from a prohibition pursuant to a petition under § 268.6, with respect to those wastes and units covered by the petition;

(3) The wastes meet the applicable alternate treatment standards established pursuant to a petition granted under § 268.44; or

(4) Persons have been granted an extension to the effective date of a prohibition pursuant to § 268.5, with respect to these wastes covered by the extension.

(f) To determine whether a hazardous waste identified in this section exceeds the applicable treatment standards specified in § 268.40, the initial generator must test a sample of the waste extract or the entire waste, depending on whether the treatment standards are expressed as concentration in the waste extract or the waste, or the generator may use knowledge of the waste. If the waste contains constituents (including underlying hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes) in excess of the applicable Universal Treatment Standard levels of § 268.48 of this part, the waste is prohibited from land disposal, and all requirements of part 268 are applicable, except as otherwise specified.
