(2) Methods to measure the composition of the COstream must conform to applicable chemical analytical standards. Acceptable methods include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration food-grade specifications for CO(21 CFR 184.1240) and ASTM standard E1747-95 (Reapproved 2005) Standard Guide for Purity of Carbon Dioxide Used in Supercritical Fluid Applications (ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373,).

(c) You shall convert the density of the COstream(s) and all measured volumes of carbon dioxide to the following standard industry temperature and pressure conditions: Standard cubic meters at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at an absolute pressure of 1 atmosphere. If you apply the density value for COat standard conditions, you must use 0.001868 metric tons per standard cubic meter.
