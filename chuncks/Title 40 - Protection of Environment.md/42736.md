###### § 75.58 General recordkeeping provisions for specific situations.
####### Specific SO,emission record provisions during the combustion of gaseous fuel.

(e)(1) If SOemissions are determined in accordance with the provisions in § 75.11(e)(2) during hours in which only gaseous fuel is combusted in a unit with an SOCEMS, the owner or operator shall record the information in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in lieu of the information in §§ 75.57(c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(4), for those hours.

(2) The provisions of this paragraph apply to a unit which, in accordance with the provisions of § 75.11(e)(3), uses an SOCEMS to determine SOemissions during hours in which only gaseous fuel is combusted in the unit. If the unit sometimes burns only gaseous fuel that is very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) as a primary and/or backup fuel and at other times combusts higher sulfur fuels, such as coal or oil, as primary and/or backup fuel(s), then the owner or operator shall keep records on-site, in a form suitable for inspection, of the type(s) of fuel(s) burned during each period of missing SOdata and the number of hours that each type of fuel was combusted in the unit during each missing data period. This recordkeeping requirement does not apply to an affected unit that burns very low sulfur fuel exclusively, nor does it apply to a unit that burns such gaseous fuel(s) only during unit startup.
