####### Special considerations for blending of fuels.,i.e.,

(3)In situations where different types of fuel listed in Table C-1 of this subpart (for example, different ranks of coal or different grades of fuel oil) are in the same state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas), and are blended prior to combustion, use the following procedures to determine the appropriate COemission factor and HHV for the blend.

(i) If the fuels to be blended are received separately, and if the quantity (mass or volume) of each fuel is measured before the fuels are mixed and combusted, then, for each component of the blend, calculate the COmass emissions separately. Substitute into Equation C-2a of this subpart the total measured mass or volume of the component fuel (from company records), together with the appropriate default COemission factor from Table C-1, and the annual average HHV, calculated according to ยง 98.33(a)(2)(ii). In this case, the fact that the fuels are blended prior to combustion is of no consequence.
