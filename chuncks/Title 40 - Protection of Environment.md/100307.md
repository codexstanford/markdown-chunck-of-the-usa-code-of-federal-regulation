(7) Calculate positive work,as the work over the duty cycle at the axle input shaft, wheel hubs, or the engine's crankshaft, as applicable, when vehicle speed is at or above 0.100 m/s. For plug-in hybrids engines and powertrains, calculate,by calculating the positive work over each of the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting test intervals and then averaging them together.

(8) The following tables illustrate the GEM data inputs corresponding to the different vehicle configurations for a given duty cycle:

(i) For the transient cycle:

(ii) For the cruise cycles:
