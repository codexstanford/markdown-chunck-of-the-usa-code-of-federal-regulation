For compound-specific sampling requirements refer to FTIR sampling methods (reference 1). For data reduction procedures and requirements refer to the EPA FTIR Protocol (reference 2), hereafter referred to as the "FTIR Protocol." This specification describes sampling and analytical procedures for quality assurance. The infrared spectrum of any absorbing compound provides a distinct signature. The infrared spectrum of a mixture contains the superimposed spectra of each mixture component. Thus, an FTIR CEM provides the capability to continuously measure multiple components in a sample using a single analyzer. The number of compounds that can be speciated in a single spectrum depends, in practice, on the specific compounds present and the test conditions.

For a list of definitions related to FTIR spectroscopy refer to Appendix A of the FTIR Protocol. Unless otherwise specified, spectroscopic terms, symbols and equations in this performance specification are taken from the FTIR Protocol or from documents cited in the Protocol. Additional definitions are given below.
