####### All slabstock affected sources.

(b)For slabstock affected sources, failure to meet the requirements contained in § 63.1294 shall be considered a violation of this subpart. Violation of each item listed in the paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section, as applicable, shall be considered a separate violation.

(1) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(a) in accordance with § 63.1294(a)(1), each unloading event that occurs when the diisocyanate storage vessel is not equipped with a vapor return line from the storage vessel to the tank truck or rail car, each unloading event that occurs when the vapor line is not connected, each unloading event that the vapor line is not inspected for leaks as described in § 63.1294(a)(1)(i), each unloading event that occurs after a leak has been detected and not repaired, and each calendar day after a leak is detected, but not repaired as soon as practicable;

(2) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(a) in accordance with § 63.1294(a)(2), each unloading event that the diisocyanate storage vessel is not equipped with a carbon adsorption system, each unloading event (or each month if more than one unloading event occurs in a month) that the carbon adsorption system is not monitored for breakthrough in accordance with § 63.1303(a)(3) or (4), and each unloading event that occurs when the carbon is not replaced after an indication of breakthrough;

(4) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(b) in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(1), each calendar day that a transfer pump in diisocyanate service is not a sealless pump;

(5) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(b) in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(2), each calendar day that a transfer pump in diisocyanate service is not submerged as described in § 63.1294(b)(2)(i), each week that the pump is not visually monitored for leaks, each calendar day after 5 calendar days after detection of a leak that a first attempt at repair has not been made in accordance with § 63.1294(b)(2)(iii)(B), and the earlier of each calendar day after 15 calendar days after detection of a leak that a leak is not repaired, or a leak is not repaired as soon as practicable, each subsequent calendar day (with the exception of situations meeting the criteria of § 63.1294(d));

(6) For each affected source complying with § 63.1294(c), each calendar day after 5 calendar days after detection of a leak that a first attempt at repair has not been made, and the earlier of each calendar day after 15 calendar days after detection of a leak that a leak is not repaired, or if a leak is not repaired as soon as practicable, each subsequent calendar day (with the exception of situations meeting the criteria of § 63.1294(d)).
