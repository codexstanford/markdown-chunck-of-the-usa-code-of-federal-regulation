###### § 721.11422 Alkanediamine, dialkyl-, polymer with .alpha.-hydro-.omega.-[(1-oxo-2-propen-1-yl)oxy]poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) ether with substituted alkyl-substituted alkanediol, reaction products with alkyl-alkanamine (generic).
####### Protection in the workplace.,e.g.,,e.g.,

(i)Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(4) through (6) and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (enclosure or confinement of the operation, general, and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 1,000. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), the airborne form(s) of the substance include particulate.

(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA Order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.039 mg/mas an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA Order.

(B) [Reserved]
