###### ยง 1036.125 Maintenance instructions and allowable maintenance.
####### Recommended additional maintenance.

(b)You may recommend any amount of critical emission-related maintenance that is additional to what we approve in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that the recommended additional maintenance steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
