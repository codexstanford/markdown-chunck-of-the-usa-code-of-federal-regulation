####### Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance (SUVA).

(4)SUVA is equal to the UV absorption at 254nm (UV) (measured in m-divided by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (measured as mg/L). In order to determine SUVA, it is necessary to separately measure UVand DOC. When determining SUVA, systems must use the methods stipulated in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to measure DOC and the method stipulated in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section to measure UV. SUVA must be determined on water prior to the addition of disinfectants/oxidants by the system. DOC and UVsamples used to determine a SUVA value must be taken at the same time and at the same location.
