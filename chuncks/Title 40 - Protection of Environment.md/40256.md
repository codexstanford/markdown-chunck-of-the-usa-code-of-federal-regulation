###### Sample Extraction Pump.

6.12A leak-free heated head pump (KNF Neuberger or equivalent) capable of extracting sample effluent through entire sampling system at a rate which prevents analyte losses and minimizes analyzer response time. The pump should have a heated by-pass and may be placed either before the FTIR instrument or after. If the sample pump is located upstream of the FTIR instrument, it must be fabricated from materials non-reactive to HCl. The sampling system and FTIR measurement system shall allow the operator to obtain at least six sample spectra during a one-hour period.
