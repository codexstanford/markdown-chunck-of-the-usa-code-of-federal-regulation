###### ยง 795.225 Dermal pharmacokinetics of DGBE and DGBA.
####### Dosage and treatment.

(ii)(A) Two doses of DGBA shall be used in the study, a "low" dose and a "high" dose. Three doses of DGBE shall be used in the study, a neat "low" dose, an aqueous "low" dose, and neat "high" dose. When administered dermally, the "high" dose level should ideally induce some overt toxicity such as weight loss. The "low" dose level should correspond to a no observed effect level.

(B) For dermal treatment, the doses shall be applied in a volume adequate to deliver the prescribed doses. The backs of the rats should be lightly shaved with an electric clipper shortly before treatment. The dose shall be applied with a micropipette on a specific area (for example, 2 cm) on the freshly shaven skin.
