(ii)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.80(k)(A significant new use is use other than as: A semi-conductor, conductive, or resistive element in electronic circuitry and devices; an electro-mechanical switch in electronic circuitry and devices; a film laminate to improve structural, electrical or electro-chemical properties of composite materials; a film laminate to improve conductivity in batteries, capacitors and fuels cells; with composite materials to improve their mechanical properties and electrical conductivities; catalyst support for use in fuel cells; in a nanoporous network in gas diffusion layers; for separation of chemicals; an additive to improve corrosion resistance of metals; an additive in lubricants and greases to improve wear resistance; an additive for transparency and conductivity in electronic devices; an additive for fibers in structural and electrical applications; an additive for fibers in fabrics and as a chemical intermediate) and (q). A significant new use is any use involving an application method that generates a vapor, mist or aerosol unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process. An enclosed process is defined as an operation that is designed and operated so that there is no release associated with normal or routine production processes into the environment of any substance present in the operation. An operation with inadvertent or emergency pressure relief releases remains an enclosed process so long as measures are taken to prevent worker exposure to and environmental contamination from the releases.
