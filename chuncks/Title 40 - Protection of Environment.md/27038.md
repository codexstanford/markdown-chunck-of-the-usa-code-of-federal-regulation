() If the total annual average daily volume of crude oil loaded at the facility was less than 550,000 barrels per day in the prior calendar year, there shall be no maintenance allowance.

(iii) If the average daily loading rate for the loading berths not equipped with a vapor collection system and control device is greater than the combined amounts in any year listed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) and (d)(2)(ii)(A) and (B), then the owner or operator of the VMT source shall equip all loading berths used for routine loading with a vapor collection system and control device within 2 years of the exceedance except that in an emergency situation the Administrator may, instead of requiring controls, approve an alternative plan to reduce loading over the unequipped berth(s) to a level which will ensure compliance with the applicable limit. Beginning in the year 2002, the owner or operator of the VMT source shall equip all uncontrolled loading berths used for marine tank vessel loading operations beyond the maintenance allowance in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) with a vapor collection system and control device.

(iv) The owner or operator of the VMT source shall develop a program to communicate to relevant facility operations and marine transportation personnel and engage their active and consistent participation in honoring the intent and goal of minimizing loaded volumes over the unequipped berths and maximizing the loaded volumes at the berths equipped with a vapor collection system and control device to prevent exceedance of the load volume limits in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(A) and (B). This program is to be presented semi-annually during the first year of compliance and annually thereafter until the use of unequipped berths for routine loading is no longer required.

(e) Operation and maintenance requirements for air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment for affected sources. At all times, owners or operators of affected sources shall operate and maintain a source, including associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

(1) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards by evaluating an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements.

(2) The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written operation and maintenance plan that describes in detail a program of corrective action for varying (i.e., exceeding baseline parameters) air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, based on monitoring requirements in § 63.564, used to comply with these emissions standards. The plan shall also identify all routine or otherwise predictable continuous monitoring system (thermocouples, pressure transducers, continuous emissions monitors (CEMS), etc.) variances.

(i) The plan shall specify procedures (preventive maintenance) to be followed to ensure that pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment functions properly and variances of the control equipment and monitoring equipment are minimal.

(ii) The plan shall identify all operating parameters to be monitored and recorded for the air pollution control device as indicators of proper operation and shall establish the frequency at which the parameters will be monitored (see § 63.564).

(iii) Owners or operators of affected sources shall incorporate a standardized inspection schedule for each component of the control device used to comply with the emissions standards in § 63.562(b), (c), and (d). To satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, the owner or operator may use the inspection schedule recommended by the vendor of the control system or any other technical publication regarding the operation of the control system.

(iv) Owners or operators shall develop and implement a continuous monitoring system (CMS) quality control program. The owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for the CMS performance evaluation required in § 63.8(e) of subpart A of this part. Each quality control program shall include, at a minimum, a written protocol that describes procedures for initial and any subsequent calibration of the CMS; determination and adjustment of the calibration drift of the CMS; preventive maintenance of the CMS, including spare parts inventory; data recording, calculations, and reporting; and accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis methods. The owner or operation shall maintain records of the procedures that are part of the quality control program developed and implemented for CMS.

(3) Based on the results of the determination made under paragraph (e)(2), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the operation and maintenance plan for that source. Revisions may be required if the plan:

(i) Does not address a variance of the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment that has occurred that increases emissions;

(ii) Fails to provide for operation during a variance of the air pollution control equipment or the monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; or

(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting a variance of the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment as soon as reasonable.

(4) If the operation and maintenance plan fails to address or inadequately addresses a variance event at the time the plan was initially developed, the owner or operator shall revise the operation and maintenance plan within 45 working days after such an event occurs. The revised plan shall include procedures for operating and maintaining the air pollution control equipment or monitoring equipment during similar variance events and a program for corrective action for such events.

(5) The operation and maintenance plan shall be developed by the source's compliance date. The owner or operator shall keep the written operation and maintenance plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator for the life of the source. In addition, if the operation and maintenance plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the plan on record to be made available for inspection upon request by the Administrator for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan.

(6) To satisfy the requirements of the operation and maintenance plan, the owner or operator may use the source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) plan, or other existing plans provided the alternative plans meet the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.

(7) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the respondent fails to meet its burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.

(i) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:

(A) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;

(B) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;

(C) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;

(D) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(E) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;

(F) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;

(G) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;

(H) At all times, the affected facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and

(I) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
