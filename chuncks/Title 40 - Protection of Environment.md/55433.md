###### Significantly more stringent limitation

(m)means BODand SS limitations necessary to meet the percent removal requirements of at least 5 mg/l more stringent than the otherwise applicable concentration-based limitations (e.g., less than 25 mg/l in the case of the secondary treatment limits for BODand SS), or the percent removal limitations in §§ 133.102 and 133.105, if such limits would, by themselves, force significant construction or other significant capital expenditure.
