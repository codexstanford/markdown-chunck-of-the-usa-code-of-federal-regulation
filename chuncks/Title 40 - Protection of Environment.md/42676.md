####### Correlation analysis.

(2)The owner or operator shall conduct the correlation analysis according to the following procedures.

(i) Plot each of the paired emissions readings as a separate point on a graph where the vertical axis represents the value (pollutant concentration or volumetric flow, as appropriate) generated by the alternative monitoring system and the horizontal axis represents the value (pollutant concentration or volumetric flow, as appropriate) generated by the continuous emission monitoring system (or reference method). On the graph, draw a horizontal line representing the mean value, e, for the alternative monitoring system and a vertical line representing the mean value, e, for the continuous emission monitoring system where,

(ii) Use the following equation to calculate the coefficient of correlation, r, between the emissions data from the alternative monitoring system and the continuous emission monitoring system using all hourly data for which paired values were available from both monitoring systems.

(iii) If the calculated r-value is less than 0.8, the proposed method is unacceptable.
