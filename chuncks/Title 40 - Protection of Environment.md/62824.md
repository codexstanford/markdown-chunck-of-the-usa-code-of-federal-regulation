####### Adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level.

(3)The energy average level for the measured retarder sounds must be calculated to determine the value of the average maximum A-weighted sound level (L). This value is then adjusted by adding the adjustment (C) from Table 2 appropriate to the number of measurements divided by the duration of the measurement period (n/T), to obtain the adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level (L) for retarders.
