###### ยง 1054.612 What special provisions apply for equipment manufacturers modifying certified nonhandheld engines?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you buy certified nonhandheld engines for installation in equipment you produce, but you install the engines such that they use intake or exhaust systems that are not part of the originally certified configuration, you become the engine manufacturer for those engines and must certify that they will meet emission standards. We will allow you to utilize the provisions for simplified certification specified in paragraph (b) of this section, as long as your design stays within the overall specifications from the original engine manufacturer (such as exhaust backpressure) and you use a catalyst as described in the original engine manufacturer's application for certification.
