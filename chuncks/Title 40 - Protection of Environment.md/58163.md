(e)Each application for new registration must be accompanied by five legible copies of draft labeling (typescript or mock-up). Each application for amended registration that proposes to make any changes in the product labeling must be accompanied by five legible copies of draft labeling incorporating the proposed labeling changes. If the proposed labeling change affects only a portion of the labeling, such as the use directions, the applicant may submit five copies of that portion of the label which is the subject of the amendment. Upon request, an applicant for amended registration must submit a complete label to consolidate amendments.
