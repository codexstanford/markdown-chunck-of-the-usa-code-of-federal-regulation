###### § 75.57 General recordkeeping provisions.
####### CO,emission record provisions.

(e)Except for a low mass emissions unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19(c) for estimating COmass emissions, the owner or operator shall record or calculate COemissions for each affected unit using one of the following methods specified in this section:

(1) If the owner or operator chooses to use a COCEMS (including an Omonitor and flow monitor, as specified in appendix F to this part), then the owner or operator shall record for each hour or partial hour during which the unit operates the following information for COmass emissions, as measured and reported from the certified primary monitor, certified back-up monitor, or other approved method of emissions determination:

(i) Component-system identification code, as provided in § 75.53 (including identification code for the moisture monitoring system, if applicable);

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Hourly average COconcentration (in percent, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(iv) Hourly average volumetric flow rate (scfh, rounded to the nearest thousand scfh);

(v) Hourly average moisture content of flue gas (percent, rounded to the nearest tenth), where COconcentration is measured on a dry basis. If the continuous moisture monitoring system consists of wet- and dry-basis oxygen analyzers, also record both the hourly wet- and dry-basis oxygen readings (in percent O, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vi) Hourly average COmass emission rate (tons/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vii) Percent monitor data availability for both the COmonitoring system and, if applicable, the moisture monitoring system (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent), calculated pursuant to § 75.32;

(viii) Method of determination for hourly average COmass emission rate and hourly average COconcentration, and, if applicable, for the hourly average moisture percentage, using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of this section;

(ix) Identification code for emissions formula used to derive hourly average COmass emission rate, as provided in § 75.53; and

(x) Indication of whether the diluent cap was used for COcalculation for the hour.

(2) As an alternative to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may use the procedures in § 75.13 and in appendix G to this part, and shall record daily the following information for COmass emissions:

(i) Date;

(ii) Daily combustion-formed COmass emissions (tons/day, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(iii) For coal-fired units, flag indicating whether optional procedure to adjust combustion-formed COmass emissions for carbon retained in flyash has been used and, if so, the adjustment;

(iv) For a unit with a wet flue gas desulfurization system or other controls generating CO, daily sorbent-related COmass emissions (tons/day, rounded to the nearest tenth); and

(v) For a unit with a wet flue gas desulfurization system or other controls generating CO, total daily COmass emissions (tons/day, rounded to the nearest tenth) as the sum of combustion-formed emissions and sorbent-related emissions.
