####### Disputed permits or redesignations.

(t)If any State affected by the redesignation of an area by an Indian Governing Body, or any Indian Governing Body of a tribe affected by the redesignation of an area by a State, disagrees with such redesignation, or if a permit is proposed to be issued for any major stationary source or major modification proposed for construction in any State which the Governor of an affected State or Indian Governing Body of an affected tribe determines will cause or contribute to a cumulative change in air quality in excess of that allowed in this part within the affected State or Indian Reservation, the Governor or Indian Governing Body may request the Administrator to enter into negotiations with the parties involved to resolve such dispute. If requested by any State or Indian Governing Body involved, the Administrator shall make a recommendation to resolve the dispute and protect the air quality related values of the lands involved. If the parties involved do not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve the dispute and his determination, or the results of agreements reached through other means, shall become part of the applicable State implementation plan and shall be enforceable as part of such plan. In resolving such disputes relating to area redesignation, the Administrator shall consider the extent to which the lands involved are of sufficient size to allow effective air quality management or have air quality related values of such an area.
