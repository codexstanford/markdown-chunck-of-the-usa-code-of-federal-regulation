###### ยง 180.34 Tests on the amount of residue remaining.

(a) Data in a petition on the amount of residue remaining in or on a raw agricultural commodity should establish the residue that may remain when the pesticide chemical is applied according to directions registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or according to directions contained in an application for registration. These data should establish the residues that may remain under conditions most likely to result in high residues on the commodity.

(b) The petition should establish the reliability of the residue data reported in it. Sufficient information should be submitted about the analytical method to permit competent analysts to apply it successfully.

(c) If the pesticide chemical is absorbed into a living plant or animal when applied (is systemic), residue data may be needed on each plant or animal on which a tolerance or exemption is requested.

(d) If the pesticide chemical is not absorbed into the living plant or animal when applied (is not systemic), it may be possible to make a reliable estimate of the residues to be expected on each commodity in a group of related commodities on the basis of less data than would be required for each commodity in the group, considered separately.
