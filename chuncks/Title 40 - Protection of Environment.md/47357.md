####### Ambient corrections.

(e)The measured data shall be corrected based on the ambient conditions under which it was taken, as specified in this section.

(1) For engines operating within the ambient conditions specified in ยง 86.007-11(a)(4)(ii)(a):

(i) NOemissions shall be corrected for ambient air humidity to a standard humidity level of 50 grains (7.14 g/kg) if the humidity of the intake air was below 50 grains, or to 75 grains (10.71 g/kg) if above 75 grains.

(ii) NOand PM emissions shall be corrected for ambient air temperature to a temperature of 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C) for ambient air temperatures below 55 degrees F or to 95 degrees F (35.0 degrees C) if the ambient air temperature is above 95 degrees F.

(iii) No ambient air temperature or humidity correction factors shall be used within the ranges of 50-75 grains or 55-95 degrees F.

(iv) Where test conditions require such correction factors, the manufacturer must use good engineering judgement and generally accepted engineering practice to determine the appropriate correction factors, subject to EPA review.

(2) For engines operating within the ambient conditions specified in ยง 86.007-11(a)(4)(ii)(b):

(i) NOemissions shall be corrected for ambient air humidity to a standard humidity level of 50 grains (7.14 g/kg) if the humidity of the intake air was below 50 grains, or to 75 grains (10.71 g/kg) if above 75 grains.

(ii) NOand PM emissions shall be corrected for ambient air temperature to a temperature of 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C) for ambient air temperatures below 55 degrees F.

(iii) No ambient air temperature or humidity correction factors shall be used within the ranges of 50-75 grains or for temperatures greater than or equal to 55 degrees F.

(iv) Where test conditions require such correction factors, the manufacturer must use good engineering judgement and generally accepted engineering practice to determine the appropriate correction factors, subject to EPA review.
