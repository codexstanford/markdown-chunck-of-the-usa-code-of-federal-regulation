####### Exhaust gas sensor heater malfunction criteria.

(iv)(A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the heater performance when the current or voltage drop in the heater circuit is no longer within the manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation (i.e., within the criteria required to be met by the component vendor for heater circuit performance at high mileage). Other malfunction criteria for heater performance malfunctions may be used upon demonstrating via data or engineering analyses that the monitoring reliability and timeliness is equivalent to the stated criteria in this paragraph (h)(8)(iv)(A).

(B) The OBD system must detect malfunctions of the heater circuit including open or short circuits that conflict with the commanded state of the heater (e.g., shorted to 12 Volts when commanded to 0 Volts (ground)).
