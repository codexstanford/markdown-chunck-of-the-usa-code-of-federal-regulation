######## Dewpoint.

(3)We recommend a minimum of three different temperature-equilibrated and temperature-monitored calibration salt solutions in containers that seal completely around the dewpoint sensor. We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within +/-0.5% uncertainty.

(b) You may remove system components for off-site calibration. We recommend specifying calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable within +/-0.5% uncertainty.
