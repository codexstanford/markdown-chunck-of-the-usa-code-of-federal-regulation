3.3.3To evaluate the resources factor, select the highest value specified below that applies for the aquifer being evaluated. Assign this value as the resources factor value for the aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.

Assign a resources value of 5 if water drawn from any target well for the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0) is used for one or more of the following purposes:

- Irrigation (5-acre minimum) of commercial food crops or commercial forage crops.

- Watering of commercial livestock.

- Ingredient in commercial food preparation.

- Supply for commercial aquaculture.

- Supply for a major or designated water recreation area, excluding drinking water use.

Assign a resources value of 5 if no drinking water wells are within the target distance limit, but the water in the aquifer being evaluated or any overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0) is usable for drinking water purposes.

Assign a resources value of 0 if none of the above applies.
