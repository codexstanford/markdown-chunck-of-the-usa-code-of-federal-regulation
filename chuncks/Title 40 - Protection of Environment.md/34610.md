###### Emission Limitations
####### § 63.3890 What emission limits must I meet?

(a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3941, § 63.3951, or § 63.3961.

(1) For each new general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.23 kilograms (kg) (1.9 pound (lb)) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(2) For each new high performance coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 3.3 kg (27.5 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(3) For each new magnet wire coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.050 kg (0.44 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(4) For each new rubber-to-metal coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.81 kg (6.8 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(5) For each new extreme performance fluoropolymer coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.5 kg (12.4 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(b) For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3941, § 63.3951, or § 63.3961.

(1) For each existing general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.31 kg (2.6 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(2) For each existing high performance coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 3.3 kg (27.5 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(3) For each existing magnet wire coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.12 kg (1.0 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(4) For each existing rubber-to-metal coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 4.5 kg (37.7 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(5) For each existing extreme performance fluoropolymer coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.5 kg (12.4 lbs) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(c) If your facility's surface coating operations meet the applicability criteria of more than one of the subcategory emission limits specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, you may comply separately with each subcategory emission limit or comply using one of the alternatives in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
