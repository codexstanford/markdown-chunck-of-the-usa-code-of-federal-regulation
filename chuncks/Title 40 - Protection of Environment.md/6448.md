###### Different pitot tube coefficient.,see

8.7.2.1You must use Equation 25 to correct the recorded preliminary velocity pressures if the pitot tube mounted on the combined cyclone sampling head has a different pitot tube coefficient than the pitot tube used during the preliminary velocity traverse (Section 8.3.4).

8.7.2.2 Probe blockage factor. You must use Equation 26 to calculate an average probe blockage correction factor (b) if the diameter of your stack or duct is between 25.7 and 36.4 inches for the combined PM/PMsampling head and pitot and between 18.8 and 26.5 inches for the PMcyclone and pitot. A probe blockage factor is calculated because of the flow blockage caused by the relatively large cross-sectional area of the cyclone sampling head, as discussed in Section 8.3.2.2 and illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 of Section 17. You must determine the cross-sectional area of the cyclone head you use and determine its stack blockage factor. (Note: Commercially-available sampling heads (including the PMcyclone, PMcyclone, pitot and filter holder) have a projected area of approximately 31.2 square inches when oriented into the gas stream.) As the probe is moved from the outermost to the innermost point, the amount of blockage that actually occurs ranges from approximately 13 square inches to the full 31.2 square inches plus the blockage caused by the probe extension. The average cross-sectional area blocked is 22 square inches.
