####### Evaluation of results.

(B)An evaluation should include the relationship, if any, between exposure of the animals to the test substance and the incidence and severity of all abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, body weight changes, effects on mortality, and any other toxic effects. The LDvalue should always be considered in conjunction with the observed toxic effects and any necropsy findings. The LDvalue is a relatively coarse measurement, useful only as a reference value for classification and labeling purposes, and for an expression of the lethal potential of the test substance by the dermal route. Reference should always be made to the experimental animal species in which the LDvalue was obtained.
