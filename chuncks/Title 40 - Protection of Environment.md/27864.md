####### Chemical milling maskant application operations

(f). Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the organic HAP and VOC content limits for the chemical milling maskant application operation, as specified in § 63.747(c), or the control system requirements specified in § 63.747(d), shall record the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, as appropriate. Each owner and operator using coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance with the applicable organic HAP or VOC limit specified in § 63.747(c) may retain the manufacturer's documentation and annual purchase records in place of the records specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Owners and operators using the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating, and adding non-HAP solvent to those coatings, must also maintain records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.

(1) For uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that meet the organic HAP or VOC content limit without averaging:

(i) The mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of chemical milling maskant as applied (less water) (H) and the mass of VOC emitted per unit volume of chemical milling maskant as applied (less water and exempt solvents) (G) for each chemical milling maskant formulation used each month (as determined by the procedures specified in § 63.750 (k) and (m));

(ii) All data, calculations, and test results (including EPA Method 24 results) used in determining the values of Hand G; and

(iii) The volume (gal) of each chemical milling maskant formulation used each month.

(2) For chemical milling maskants complying with the organic HAP or VOC content level by averaging:

(i) The monthly volume-weighted average masses of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of chemical milling maskant as applied (less water) (H) and of VOC emitted per unit volume of chemical milling maskant as applied (less water and exempt solvents) (G) for all chemical milling maskants (as determined by the procedures specified in § 63.750 (l) and (n)); and

(ii) All data, calculations, and test results (including EPA Method 24 results) used to determine the values of Hand G.

(3) For chemical milling maskants that are controlled by a carbon adsorber:

(i) The overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. The length of the rolling material balance period and all data and calculations used for determining this rolling period. The record of the certification of the accuracy of the device that measures the amount of HAP or VOC recovered; or

(ii) For nonregenerative carbon adsorbers, the overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. The record of the carbon replacement time established as the site-specific operating parameter to demonstrate compliance.

(4) For chemical milling maskants that are controlled by a control device other than a carbon adsorber:

(i) The overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(h)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency;

(ii) If an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, continuous records of the firebox temperature recorded under § 63.751(b)(9) and all calculated 3-hour averages of the firebox temperature; and

(iii) If a catalytic incinerator is used, continuous records of the temperature recorded under § 63.751(b)(10) and all calculated 3-hour averages of the recorded temperatures.
