8.3

8.3.1. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the primary test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix A. This method can be used for refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including Refrigerants 11 and 13. For all refrigerants, the sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this method.

8.3.2 The Karl Fischer Test Method is an acceptable alternative test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is described in ASTM Standard for "Water in gases Using Karl Fisher Reagent" E700-79, reapproved 1984 (American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA).

8.3.3 Report the moisture level in parts per million by weight if a sample is required.
