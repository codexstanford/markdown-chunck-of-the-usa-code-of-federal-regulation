###### What requirements must I meet if I use a temporary opacity monitor?

10.6

(1) In the event that your certified opacity monitor has to be removed for extended service, you may install a temporary replacement monitor to obtain required opacity emissions data provided that:

(i) The temporary monitor has been certified according to ASTM D6216-12 for which a MCOC has been provided;

(ii) The use of the temporary monitor does not exceed 1080 hours (45 days) of operation per year as a replacement for a fully certified opacity monitor. After that time, the analyzer must complete a full certification according to PS-1 prior to further use as a temporary replacement monitor. Once a temporary replacement monitor has been installed and required testing and adjustments have been successfully completed, it cannot be replaced by another temporary replacement monitor to avoid the full PS-1 certification testing required after 1080 hours (45 days) of use;

(iii) The temporary monitor has been installed and successfully completed an optical alignment assessment and status indicator assessment;

(iv) The temporary monitor has successfully completed an off-stack clear path zero assessment and zero calibration value adjustment procedure;

(v) The temporary monitor has successfully completed an abbreviated zero and upscale drift check consisting of seven zero and upscale calibration value drift checks which may be conducted within a 24-hour period with not more than one calibration drift check every three hours and not less than one calibration drift check every 25 hours. Calculated zero and upscale drift requirements are the same as specified for the normal PS-1 certification;

(vi) The temporary monitor has successfully completed a three-point calibration error test;

(vii) The upscale reference calibration check value of the new monitor has been updated in the associated data recording equipment;

(viii) The overall calibration of the monitor and data recording equipment has been verified; and

(ix) The user has documented all of the above in the maintenance log.

(2) Data generated by the temporary monitor is considered valid when paragraphs (i) through (ix) in this section have been met.
