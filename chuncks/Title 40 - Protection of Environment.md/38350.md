####### Conditional Data Validation.

5.1.5For certification, recertification, and diagnostic testing of Hg monitoring systems, and for the required QA tests when non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems or temporary like-kind Hg analyzers are brought into service, the conditional data validation provisions in §§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter may be used to avoid or minimize data loss. The allotted window of time to complete 7-day calibration error tests, linearity checks, cycle time tests, and RATAs shall be as specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter. Required system integrity checks must be completed within 168 unit or stack operating hours after the probationary calibration error test.
