###### 3.12 Low-Concentration Analyzer

means any analyzer that operates with a calibration span of 20 ppm NOor lower. Each analyzer model used routinely to measure low NOconcentrations must pass a manufacturer's stability test (MST). An MST subjects the analyzer to a range of line voltages and temperatures that reflect potential field conditions to demonstrate its stability following procedures similar to those provided in 40 CFR 53.23. Ambient-level analyzers are exempt from the MST requirements of section 16.3. A copy of this information must be included in each test report. Table 7E-5 lists the criteria to be met.
