###### Appendix A to Subpart L of Part 98 - Mass Balance Method for Fluorinated Gas Production
####### Mass balance monitoring.

(b)If you determine fluorinated GHG emissions from any process using the mass balance method under ยง 98.123(b), you must estimate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG emitted from that process at least monthly. Only streams that contain greater than trace concentrations of fluorine-containing reactants, products, or by-products must be monitored under this paragraph. If you use an element other than fluorine in the mass-balance equation pursuant to ยง 98.123(b)(3), substitute that element for fluorine in the monitoring requirements of this paragraph.
