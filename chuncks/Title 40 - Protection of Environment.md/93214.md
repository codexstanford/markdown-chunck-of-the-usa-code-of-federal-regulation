####### Manufacture, import, or process for commercial purposes

means:

(1) To import, produce, manufacture, or process with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer, importer, or processor, and includes, among other things, "manufacture" or "processing" of any amount of a microorganism or microbial mixture:

(i) For commercial distribution, including for test marketing.

(ii) For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research and development or as an intermediate.

(2) The term also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another microorganism or microbial mixture, including byproducts that are separated from that other microorganism or microbial mixture and impurities that remain in that microorganism or microbial mixture. Byproducts and impurities without separate commercial value are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage, since they are part of the manufacture or processing of a microorganism for commercial purposes.
