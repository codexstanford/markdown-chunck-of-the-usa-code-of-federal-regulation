####### 10.1.1 Zero Calibration.

For both the Oand CO cells, introduce zero gas to the measurement system (e.g., at the calibration assembly) and record the concentration reading every minute until readings are constant for at least two consecutive minutes. Include the time and sample flow rate. Repeat the steps in this section at least once to verify the zero calibration for each component gas.
