####### Confirmatory testing.

(6)(i) The Administrator may perform confirmatory testing to verify the emission test data submitted by the manufacturer as required by this paragraph (l) of this section comply with its requirements and the malfunction criteria set forth in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section. Such confirmatory testing is limited to the test engine(s) required by paragraph (l)(2) of this section.

(ii) To conduct this confirmatory testing, the Administrator may install appropriately deteriorated or malfunctioning components (or simulate them) in an otherwise properly functioning test engine of an engine rating represented by the demonstration test engine in order to test any of the components or systems required to be tested by paragraph (l) of this section. The manufacturer shall make available, if requested, an engine and all test equipment (e.g., malfunction simulators, deteriorated components) necessary to duplicate the manufacturer's testing. Such a request from the Administrator shall occur within six months of reviewing and approving the demonstration test engine data submitted by the manufacturer for the specific engine rating.
