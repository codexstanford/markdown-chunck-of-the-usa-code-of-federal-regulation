###### Calculating Organic HAP Emissions Factors for Open Molding and Centrifugal Casting
####### ยง 63.5799 How do I calculate my facility's organic HAP emissions on a tpy basis for purposes of determining which paragraphs of ยง 63.5805 apply?
######## Use a calculated emission factor.

(1)Calculate a weighted average organic HAP emissions factor on a lbs/ton of resin and gel coat basis. Base the weighted average on the prior 12 months of operation. Multiply the weighted average organic HAP emissions factor by resin and gel coat use over the same period. You may calculate this organic HAP emissions factor based on the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, or you may use any organic HAP emissions factor approved by us, such as factors from AP-42, or site-specific organic HAP emissions factors if they are supported by HAP emissions test data.
