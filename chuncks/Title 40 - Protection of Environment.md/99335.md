###### ยง 1033.510 Auxiliary power units.

If your locomotive is equipped with an auxiliary power unit (APU) that operates during an idle shutdown mode, you must account for the APU's emissions rates as specified in this section, unless the APU is part of an AESS system that was certified separately from the rest of the locomotive. This section does not apply for auxiliary engines that only provide hotel power.

(a) Adjust the locomotive main engine's idle emission rate (g/hr) as specified in ยง 1033.530. Add the APU emission rate (g/hr) that you determine under paragraph (b) of this section. Use the locomotive main engine's idle power as specified in ยง 1033.530.

(b) Determine the representative emission rate for the APU using one of the following methods.
