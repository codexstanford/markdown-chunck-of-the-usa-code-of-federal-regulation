####### Section 18 emergency exemptions.

(b)Time-limited tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide fenoxaprop-ethyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph in connection with use of fenoxaprop-ethyl under section 18 emergency exemptions granted by EPA. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenoxaprop-ethyl, (+/-)-ethyl 2-[4-[(6-chloro-2-benzoxazolyl)oxy]phenoxy]propanoate, and its metabolites, 2-[4-[(6-chloro-2-benzoxazolyl)oxy]phenoxy]propanoic acid and 6-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzoxazol-2-one, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenoxaprop-ethyl, in or on the commodity. The tolerances expire and are revoked on the dates specified in the table in this paragraph.
