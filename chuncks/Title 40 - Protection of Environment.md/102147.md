####### Stabilizing emission levels.

(e)Use good engineering judgment to operate your engines before testing such that deterioration factors can be applied appropriately. Determine the stabilization period as follows:

(1) For engine families with a useful life at or below 300 hours, operate the engine for the same number of hours before starting emission measurements that you used for the emission-data engine, within one hour. For example, if the emission-data engine operated for 8 hours before the low-hour emission test, operate the test engines for 7 to 9 hours before starting emission measurements.

(2) For engine families with a useful life above 300 hours, operate each engine for no more than the greater of two periods:

(i) 12 hours.

(ii) The number of hours you operated your emission-data engine for certifying the engine family (see 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, or the applicable regulations governing how you should prepare your test engine).
