###### Absorber-24-hour sampling:

7.1.3A polypropylene tube 32 mm in diameter and 164 mm long (available from Bel Art Products, Pequammock, NJ) is used as the absorber. The cap of the absorber must be a polypropylene cap with two ports (rubber stoppers are unacceptable because the absorbing reagent can react with the stopper to yield erroneously high SOconcentrations). A glass impinger stem, 6 mm in diameter and 158 mm long, is inserted into one port of the absorber cap. The tip of the stem is tapered to a small diameter orifice (0.4 +/-0.1 mm) such that a No. 79 jeweler's drill bit will pass through the opening but a No. 78 drill bit will not. Clearance from the bottom of the absorber to the tip of the stem must be 6 +/-2 mm. Glass stems can be fabricated by any reputable glass blower or can be obtained from a scientific supply firm. Upon receipt, the orifice test should be performed to verify the orifice size. The 50 mL volume level should be permanently marked on the absorber. The assembled absorber is shown in Figure 2.
