####### ยง 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## Unrepresentative or inadequate historical Cl,/HCl volumetric ratios.

(iv)(A) If you believe that the Cl/HCl volumetric ratio for one or more historical regulatory compliance tests is not representative of the current ratio, you may request that the permitting authority allow you to screen those ratios from the analysis of historical ratios.

(B) If the permitting authority believes that too few historical ratios are available to calculate a representative average ratio or establish a maximum ratio, the permitting authority may require you to conduct periodic testing to establish representative ratios.
