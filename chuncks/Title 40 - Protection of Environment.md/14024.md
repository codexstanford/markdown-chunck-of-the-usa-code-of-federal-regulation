() The type of fuel burned in the heaters and boilers during such time periods.

(C) Beginning June 20, 2008, MSCC shall measure the HS content of the fuel burned when fuel other than natural gas is burned in a heater or boiler that is exhausting to an auxiliary vent stack. MSCC shall begin measuring the HS content of the fuel at the fuel header within one (1) hour from when a heater or boiler begins exhausting to an auxiliary vent stack and on a once-per-3-hour period frequency until no heater or boiler is exhausting to an auxiliary vent stack. To determine the HS content of the fuel burned, MSCC shall use length-of-stain detector tubes pursuant to ASTM Method D4810-06, "Standard Test Method for Hydrogen Sulfide in Natural Gas Using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes" (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) with the appropriate sample tube range. If the results exceed the tube's range, another tube of a higher range must be used until results are in the tube's range.
