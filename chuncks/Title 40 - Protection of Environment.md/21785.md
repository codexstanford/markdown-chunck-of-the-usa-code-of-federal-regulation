###### ยง 60.5475 What compliance and certification requirements must I meet and by when?
####### Conditional, temporary certificate of compliance.

(e)A conditional, temporary certificate of compliance with the Step 1 p.m. emission standards may be granted by the Administrator until May 16, 2016 for small or large forced-air furnaces based on the manufacturer's submittal of a complete certification application meeting all requirements in ยง 60.5475(b). The application must include the full test report by an EPA-approved laboratory and all required compliance statements by the manufacturer with the exception of a certificate of conformity by an EPA approved third-party certifier. The conditional, temporary approval would allow early marketing of forced-air furnaces as having a conditional, temporary certificate of compliance with the Step 1 p.m. emission standards until May 16, 2016 or until the Administrator completes the review of the application, whichever is earlier.
