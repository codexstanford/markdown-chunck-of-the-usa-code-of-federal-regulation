###### ยง 1036.512 Federal Test Procedure.

(a) Measure emissions using the transient Federal Test Procedure (FTP) as described in this section to determine whether engines meet the emission standards in subpart B of this part. Operate the engine or hybrid powertrain over one of the following transient duty cycles:

(1) For engines subject to spark-ignition standards, use the transient test interval described in paragraph (b) of appendix B of this part.

(2) For engines subject to compression-ignition standards, use the transient test interval described in paragraph (c) of appendix B of this part.

(b) The following procedures apply differently for testing engines and hybrid powertrains:

(1) The transient test intervals for nonhybrid engine testing are based on normalized speed and torque values. Denormalize speed as described in 40 CFR 1065.512. Denormalize torque as described in 40 CFR 1065.610(d).

(2) Test hybrid engines and hybrid powertrains as described in ยง 1036.510(b)(2), with the following exceptions:
