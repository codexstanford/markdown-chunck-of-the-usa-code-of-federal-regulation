####### Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant concentration,VOHAP concentration

ormeans the fraction by weight of those compounds listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are in an off-site material as measured using Method 305 in appendix A of this part and expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, an owner or operator may determine the HAP concentration of an off-site material using any one of the other test methods specified in ยง 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart. When a test method specified in ยง 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart other than Method 305 is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of an off-site material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding fvalue listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.
