###### § 63.1430 Process vent reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
####### Reporting requirements for Group 2 continuous process vents.

(j)(1) Whenever a process change, as defined in § 63.1420(g)(3), is made that causes a Group 2 continuous process vent with a TRE greater than 4.0 to become a Group 2 continuous process vent with a TRE less than 4.0, the owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 calendar days after the process change is made or the information regarding the process change is known, unless the flow rate is less than 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute. The report may be submitted as part of the next periodic report. The report shall include:

(i) A description of the process change;

(ii) The results of the recalculation of the TRE index value required under § 63.1428(h)(2), and recorded under paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and

(iii) A statement that the owner or operator will comply with the process vent monitoring requirements specified in § 63.1429, as appropriate.

(2) Whenever a process change, as defined in § 63.1420(g)(3), is made that causes a Group 2 continuous process vent with a flow rate less than 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute to become a Group 2 continuous process vent with a flow rate of 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute or greater, the owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 calendar days after the process change is made or the information regarding the process change is known, unless the organic HAP concentration is less than 50 ppmv. The report may be submitted as part of the next periodic report. The report shall include:

(i) A description of the process change;

(ii) The results of the calculation of the TRE index value required under § 63.1428(h)(2), and recorded under paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and

(iii) A statement that the owner or operator will comply with the process vent monitoring requirements specified in § 63.1429, as appropriate.

(3) Whenever a process change, as defined in § 63.1420(g)(3), is made that causes a Group 2 continuous process vent with an organic HAP concentration less than 50 ppmv to become a Group 2 continuous process vent with an organic HAP concentration of 50 ppmv or greater and a TRE index value less than 4.0, the owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 calendar days after the process change is made or the information regarding the process change is known, unless the flow rate is less than 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute. The report may be submitted as part of the next periodic report. The report shall include:

(i) A description of the process change;

(ii) The results of the calculation of the TRE index value required under § 63.1428(h)(2), and recorded under paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and

(iii) A statement that the owner or operator will comply with the process vent monitoring requirements specified in § 63.1429, as appropriate.
