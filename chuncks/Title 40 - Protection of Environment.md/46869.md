####### Temperature stabilization.

(f)Immediately after the hot transient exhaust emission test, the vehicle shall be soaked in a temperature controlled area for a maximum of 6 hours until the fuel temperature is stabilized. The fuel may be heated or cooled to stabilize fuel temperatures, but the fuel heating rate must not exceed 5 &#xB0;F in any 1-hour interval during the soak period. A manufacturer may use a faster heating rate or a longer period for stabilizing fuel temperatures if the needed heating cannot be easily accomplished in the 6-hour period, subject to Administrator approval.

(1) Fuel temperatures must be held at 95 +/-3 &#xB0;F for at least one hour before the start of the running loss test.

(2) If a vehicle's fuel temperature profile has an initial temperature lower than 95 &#xB0;F, as described in ยง 86.129-94(d)(7)(v), the fuel in the test vehicle must be stabilized to within 3 &#xB0;F of that temperature for at least one hour before the start of the running loss test.
