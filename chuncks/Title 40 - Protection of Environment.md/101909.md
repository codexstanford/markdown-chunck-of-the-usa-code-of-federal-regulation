###### ยง 1051.501 What procedures must I use to test my vehicles or engines?
####### Special procedures for engine testing.

(g)(1) You may use special or alternate procedures, as described in ยง 1065.10 of this chapter.

(2) We may reject data you generate using alternate procedures if later testing with the procedures in part 1065 of this chapter shows contradictory emission data.

(3) You may test engines using a test speed based on the point of maximum power if that represents in-use operation better than testing based on maximum test speed.
