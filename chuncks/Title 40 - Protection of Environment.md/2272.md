###### ยง 35.3160 Cash draw rules.
####### Aggressive leveraging exception.

(3)Where the cash draw rules discussed in ยง 35.3160(d) would significantly frustrate a State's program, the Agency may permit an exception to these cash draw rules and provide for a more accelerated cash draw, where the State can demonstrate that:

(i) There are eligible projects ready to proceed in the immediate future with enough costs to justify the amount of the secured bond issue;

(ii) The absence of cash on an accelerated basis will substantially delay these projects;

(iii) If accelerated cash draws are allowed, the SRF will provide substantially more assistance; and

(iv) The long term viability of the State program to meet water quality needs will be protected.
