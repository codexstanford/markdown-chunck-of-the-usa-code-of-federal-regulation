######## Specific alternate fuel economy and CO,emissions label values for fuel cell vehicles.

(5)Determine FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy label values for fuel cell vehicles using procedures specified by the Administrator. Convert kilograms of hydrogen/mile results to miles per kilogram of hydrogen and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent. COlabel information is based on tailpipe emissions only, so COemissions from fuel cell vehicles are assumed to be zero.
