5.2.2.1(). The analyzer output for the following test shall be maintained between 20 percent and 90 percent of span. It is recommended that a calibrated gas mixture be used to verify the span setting utilized. During this 168-hour test period, make a minimum of nine (9) SOconcentration measurements using the Reference Method with a sampling period of one hour. If a measurement system operates across the stack or a portion of it, the Reference Method test shall make a four-point traverse over the measurement system operating path. Isokinetic sampling and analysis for SOand HSOmist are not required. For measurement systems employing extractive sampling, place the measurement system and the Reference Method probe tips adjacent to each other in the duct. One test will consist of two simultaneous samples with not less than two analyses on each sample. Record the test data and measurement system concentrations on the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
