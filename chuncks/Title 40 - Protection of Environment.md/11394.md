(a) A revision to the SIP was submitted by the Governor on December 21, 1987, for visibility general plan requirements, monitoring, and long-term strategies.

(b) The Visibility NSR regulations are approved for industrial source categories regulated by the NSR and PSD regulations which have previously been approved by EPA. However, Colorado's NSR and PSD regulations have been disapproved for certain sources as listed in 40 CFR 52.343(a)(1). The provisions of 40 CFR 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of Colorado for these sources.
