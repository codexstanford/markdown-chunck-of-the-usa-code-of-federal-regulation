####### Flow Rate Calibration Procedure.

8.2

8.2.1 PMsamplers employ various types of flow control and flow measurement devices. The specific procedure used for flow rate calibration or verification will vary depending on the type of flow controller and flow indicator employed. Calibration in terms of actual volumetric flow rates (Q) is generally recommended, but other measures of flow rate (e.g., Q) may be used provided the requirements of section 8.1 are met. The general procedure given here is based on actual volumetric flow units (Q) and serves to illustrate the steps involved in the calibration of a PMsampler. Consult the sampler manufacturer's instruction manual and Reference 2 for specific guidance on calibration. Reference 14 provides additional information on the use of the commonly used measures of flow rate and their interrelationships.
