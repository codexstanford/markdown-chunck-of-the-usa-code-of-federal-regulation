####### Decorative chromium electroplating

means the process by which a thin layer of chromium (typically 0.003 to 2.5 microns) is electrodeposited on a base metal, plastic, or undercoating to provide a bright surface with wear and tarnish resistance. In this process, the part(s) serves as the cathode in the electrolytic cell and the solution serves as the electrolyte. Typical current density applied during this process ranges from 540 to 2,400 Amperes per square meter (A/m) for total plating times ranging between 0.5 to 5 minutes.
