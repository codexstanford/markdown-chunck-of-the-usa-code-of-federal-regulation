(3)To demonstrate initial compliance with the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration limit in Table 1 to this subpart, the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration must be no greater than 20 ppmv on a dry basis and the efficiency of the capture system must be 100 percent. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4312 and 63.4313. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4310, you must identify the web coating/printing operation(s) for which you used the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option and submit a statement that the web coating/printing operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration was no greater than 20 ppmv on a dry basis, the efficiency of the capture system was 100 percent, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.4292 and the work practice standards required by § 63.4293.
