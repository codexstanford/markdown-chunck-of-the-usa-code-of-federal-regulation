####### "Action" scenario.

(i)The regional emissions analysis required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must estimate the emissions that would result from the "Action" scenario in each analysis year. The "Action" scenario must be defined for each of the analysis years. The "Action" scenario is the transportation system that would result from the implementation of the proposed action (transportation plan, TIP, or project not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP) and all other expected regionally significant projects in the nonattainment area. The "Action" scenario must include the following (except that exempt projects listed in ยง 93.126 and projects exempt from regional emissions analysis as listed in ยง 93.127 need not be explicitly considered):

(1) All facilities, services, and activities in the "Baseline" scenario;

(2) Completion of all TCMs and regionally significant projects (including facilities, services, and activities) specifically identified in the proposed transportation plan which will be operational or in effect in the analysis year, except that regulatory TCMs may not be assumed to begin at a future time unless the regulation is already adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction or the TCM is identified in the applicable implementation plan;

(3) All travel demand management programs and transportation system management activities known to the MPO, but not included in the applicable implementation plan or utilizing any Federal funding or approval, which have been fully adopted and/or funded by the enforcing jurisdiction or sponsoring agency since the last conformity determination;

(4) The incremental effects of any travel demand management programs and transportation system management activities known to the MPO, but not included in the applicable implementation plan or utilizing any Federal funding or approval, which were adopted and/or funded prior to the date of the last conformity determination, but which have been modified since then to be more stringent or effective;

(5) Completion of all expected regionally significant highway and transit projects which are not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP; and

(6) Completion of all expected regionally significant non-FHWA/FTA highway and transit projects that have clear funding sources and commitments leading toward their implementation and completion by the analysis year.
