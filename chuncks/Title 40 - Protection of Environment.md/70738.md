Also include the species of fish used; the sources, size, and condition of the fish; data of any known treatment of the fish for disease or infestation with parasites before their use; and any observations on the fish behavior at regular intervals during the tests. In addition to the calculated LCvalues, other data necessary for interpretation (e.g., DO, pH, other physical parameters, and the percent survival at the end of each day of exposure at each concentration of toxicant) should be reported.
