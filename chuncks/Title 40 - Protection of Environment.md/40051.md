###### Purity Check:

Prior to using any bottle of reagent heptane, analyze it according to section 11.2 of this method. Use the bottle only if hexane and termonomer peak areas are less than 5 each.

7.4 Internal standard solution-used as a concentrate for preparation of the more dilute Polymer Dissolving Solution. It contains 12.00g heptane/100ml of solution which is 120.0g per liter.

7.5 Polymer Dissolving Solution ("PDS")-Heptane (as internal standard) in toluene. This solution contains 0.3g of heptane internal standard per 100 ml of solution.

7.5.1 Preparation of Polymer Dissolving Solution. Fill a 4,000-ml volumetric flask aboutfull with toluene.

7.5.2 Add 100 ml of the internal standard solution (section 7.4 of this method) to the flask using the 100ml pipette.

7.5.3 Fill the flask to the mark with toluene. Discard any excess.

7.5.4 Add a large magnetic stirring bar to the flask and mix by stirring.

7.5.5 Transfer the polymer solvent solution to the one-gallon labeled container with 50ml volumetric dispenser attached.
