####### Startup

means the setting in operation of a continuous process unit for any purpose; the first time a new or reconstructed batch process unit begins production; for new equipment added, including equipment used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put into operation; or, for the introduction of a new product/process, the first time the product or process is run in equipment. For batch process units, startup does not apply to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past, after a shutdown for maintenance, or when the equipment is put into operation as part of a batch within a campaign. As used in ยง 63.1255, startup means the setting in operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.
