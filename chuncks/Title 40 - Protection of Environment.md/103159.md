####### CFV molar flow rate.,C,K,n,n,A,d,d,D

(c)If you use multiple venturis and you calibrate each venturi independently to determine a separate discharge coefficient,(or calibration coefficient,), for each venturi, calculate the individual molar flow rates through each venturi and sum all their flow rates to determine CFV flow rate,. If you use multiple venturis and you calibrated venturis in combination, calculateusing the sum of the active venturi throat areas as, the square root of the sum of the squares of the active venturi throat diameters as, and the ratio of the venturi throat to inlet diameters as the ratio of the square root of the sum of the active venturi throat diameters () to the diameter of the common entrance to all the venturis ().
