###### ยง 1060.210 What records should equipment manufacturers keep if they do not apply for certification?

If you are an equipment manufacturer that does not need to obtain a certificate of conformity for your equipment as described in ยง 1060.5, you must keep the records specified in this section to document compliance with applicable requirements. We may review these records at any time. If we ask, you must send us these records within 30 days. You must keep these records for eight years from the end of the model year.

(a) Identify your equipment models and the annual U.S.-directed production volumes for each model.

(b) Identify the emission family names of the certificates that will cover your equipment, the part numbers of those certified components, and the names of the companies that hold the certificates. You must be able to identify this information for each piece of equipment you produce.

(c) Describe how you comply with any emission-related installation instructions, labeling requirements, and the general standards in ยง 1060.101(e) and (f).
