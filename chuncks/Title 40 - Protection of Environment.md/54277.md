####### Director,Director

means the Regional Administrator, the State director or the Tribal director as the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no approved State or Tribal program, and there is an EPA administered program,means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved State or Tribal program, "Director" normally means the State or Tribal director. In some circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain actions even when there is an approved State or Tribal program. (For example, when EPA has issued an NPDES permit prior to the approval of a State program, EPA may retain jurisdiction over that permit after program approval; see ยง 123.1) In such cases, the term "Director" means the Regional Administrator and not the State or Tribal director.
