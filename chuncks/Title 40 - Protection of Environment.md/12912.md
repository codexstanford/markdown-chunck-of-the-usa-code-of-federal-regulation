(i)(A) February 18, 2010, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board, AS-09-04, effective February 18, 2010.

(189) On July 29, 2010, September 16, 2011 and September 29, 2011 Illinois submitted VOM RACT rules for the Chicago and Metro-East St. Louis 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas. These rules are consistent with the Control Technique Guideline documents issued by EPA in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and satisfy the RACT requirements of the Act. On February 28, 2011, Illinois EPA submitted a confirmation that the sewage treatment plant exemption in Subpart TT of Parts 218 and 219 does not apply to industrial wastewater. This clarification clearly establishes that VOM emissions from major non-CTG industrial wastewater operations are regulated by Subpart TT.
