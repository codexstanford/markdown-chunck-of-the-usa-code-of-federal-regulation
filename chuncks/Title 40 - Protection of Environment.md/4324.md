###### 24-Hour Sampling.

9.3Place 50 mL of TCM absorbing solution in a large absorber, close the cap, and, if needed, apply the heat shrink material as shown in Figure 3. Verify that the reagent level is at the 50 mL mark on the absorber. Insert the sealed absorber into the sampling train as shown in Figure 2. At this time verify that the absorber temperature is controlled to 15 +/-10 &#xB0;C. During sampling, the absorber temperature must be controlled to prevent decomposition of the collected complex. From the onset of sampling until analysis, the absorbing solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Determine the flow rate according to Section 9.4.2. Collect the sample for 24 hours from midnight to midnight at a flow rate of 0.200 +/-0.020 L/min. A start/stop timer is helpful for initiating and stopping sampling and an elapsed time meter will be useful for determining the sampling time.
