If the vehicle or engine is not owned by the certificate holder at the time of importation, the label shall state "this vehicle or engine is warranted for five years or 50,000 miles from the date of release to the owner, whichever comes first." For vehicles imported under § 85.1509, the label shall clearly state in bold letters that "this vehicle has not been manufactured under a certificate of conformity but meets EPA air pollution control requirements under a modification/test program." In addition, for all vehicles, the label shall contain the vacuum hose routing diagram applicable to the vehicles.

Certificate holders importing under § 85.1505 or § 85.1509 shall attest to compliance with the above labeling requirements in each application for final admission.
