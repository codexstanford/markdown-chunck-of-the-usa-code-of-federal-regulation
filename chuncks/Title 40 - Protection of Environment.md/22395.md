###### 13.14 Pre-sampling Adsorbent Standard and Pre-extraction Filter Recovery Standard Recovery.

Recoveries of pre-sampling adsorbent standard added to the sample and pre-extraction filter recovery standard added to the filter must be between 70 and 130% (see Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method).

13.14.1 If the recovery of all the pre-sampling adsorbent standard compounds is below 70%, the sampling runs are not valid, and you must repeat the stack or vent sampling. As an alternative, you do not have to repeat the test if the average pre-sampling adsorbent standard recovery is 25% or more and you divide the final results by the average fraction of pre-sampling adsorbent standard recovery.

13.14.2 If the recovery of all the pre-extraction filter recovery standard compounds is below 70%, you may reanalyze the sample. If the recovery criteria are still not met, the sampling recovery is not valid, and you must repeat the stack or vent sampling.
