####### nitrification

(s) The termmeans oxidation of ammonium salts to nitrites (via Nitrosomas bacteria) and the further oxidation of nitrite to nitrate via Nitrobacter bacteria. Nitrification can be accomplished in either:

(1) A single or two-stage activated sludge wastewater treatment system; or

(2) Wetlands specifically developed with a marsh/pond configuration and maintained for the express purpose of removing ammonia-N.

Indicators of nitrification capability are:

(1) Biological monitoring for ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to determine if the nitrification is occurring; and

(2) Analysis of the nitrogen balance to determine if nitrifying bacteria reduce the amount of ammonia and increase the amount of nitrite and nitrate.
