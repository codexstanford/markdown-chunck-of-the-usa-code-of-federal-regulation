####### Test data.

(a)The goal of gathering test data is to unambiguously link specific test results to a specific vehicle, I/M program registrant, test site, and inspector, and to determine whether or not the correct testing parameters were observed for the specific vehicle in question. In turn, these data can be used to distinguish complying and noncomplying vehicles as a result of analyzing the data collected and comparing it to the registration database, to screen inspection stations and inspectors for investigation as to possible irregularities, and to help establish the overall effectiveness of the program. At a minimum, the program shall collect the following with respect to each test conducted:

(1) Test record number;

(2) Inspection station and inspector numbers;

(3) Test system number (where applicable);

(4) Date of the test;

(5) Emission test start time and the time final emission scores are determined;

(6) Vehicle Identification Number;

(7) License plate number;

(8) Test certificate number;

(9) Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR);

(10) Vehicle model year, make, and type;

(11) Number of cylinders or engine displacement;

(12) Transmission type;
