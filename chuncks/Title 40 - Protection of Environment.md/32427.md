####### Use of a flare.

(a)When a flare is used to comply with § 63.1425(b)(1)(i) (in combination with other control techniques), (b)(2)(i), (c)(1)(i), (c)(3)(i), or (d)(1), the owner or operator shall comply with § 63.1437(c), and is not required to demonstrate the control efficiency for the flare, if the owner or operator chooses to assume a 98 percent control efficiency for that flare, as allowed under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. In order to use only a flare to comply with § 63.1425(b)(1)(i), or to use a flare and apply a control efficiency greater than 98 percent, an owner or operator shall submit a request in accordance with § 63.6(g) in either the Precompliance Report described in § 63.1439(e)(4), or in a supplement to the precompliance report, as described in § 63.1439(e)(4)(vii).
