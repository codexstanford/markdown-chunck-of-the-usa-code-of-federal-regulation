####### MIL activation and DTC storage for engine misfire causing catalyst damage,Pending DTCs.

(iv)-(A)A pending DTC must be stored immediately if, during a single drive cycle, the specified misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is exceeded three times when operating in the positive torque region encountered during a FTP cycle or is exceeded on a single occasion when operating at any other engine speed and load condition in the positive torque region defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Immediately after a pending DTC is stored pursuant to this paragraph, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. The MIL may be deactivated during those times that misfire is not occurring. If, at the time that a catalyst damaging misfire malfunction occurs, the MIL is already activated for a malfunction other than misfire, the MIL must still blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated as appropriate in accordance with the other malfunction.
