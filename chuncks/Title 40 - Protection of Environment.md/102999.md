###### ยง 1065.510 Engine mapping.
####### Negative torque mapping.,i.e.,

(c)If your engine is subject to a reference duty cycle that specifies negative torque values (engine motoring), generate a motoring torque curve by any of the following procedures:

(1) Multiply the positive torques from your map by -40%. Use linear interpolation to determine intermediate values.

(2) Map the amount of negative torque required to motor the engine by repeating paragraph (b) of this section with minimum operator demand, as applicable. You may start the negative torque map at either the minimum or maximum speed from paragraph (b) of this section.

(3) Determine the amount of negative torque required to motor the engine at the following two points near the ends of the engine's speed range. Operate the engine at these two points at minimum operator demand. Use linear interpolation to determine intermediate values.
