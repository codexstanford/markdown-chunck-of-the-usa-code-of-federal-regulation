(1) Lake Tahoe Basin for CO.

(2) EPA approves the CO plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin as meeting the requirements of Part D. This approval includes the resolution of the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Agency banning new source construction pending the adoption of a new regional plan and ordinances. However, EPA disapproves the plan for any future time during which the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency may remove its construction ban prior to EPA approval of the new regional plan and ordinances.

(e) The Administrator approves the following portions of the 1999 Ozone Attainment Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area submitted by the California Air Resources Board on August 13, 1999: the 1995 baseline emissions inventory, the reasonable further progress demonstration, and the deletion of transportation control measures #6 and #16.

(f)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are "subject to regulation", as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not "subject to regulation."

(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy COe or more; or

(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy COe or more; and

(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy COe; or

(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy COe, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy COe or more.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)-

(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.

(ii) The term tpy COequivalent emissions (COe) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:

(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98-Global Warming Potentials.

(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy COe.

(iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in the EPA-approved North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(n1)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy COe, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and "significant" is defined as 75,000 tpy COe instead of applying the value in the EPA-approved North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2).

(g)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in Northern Sonoma County Air Pollution Control District's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are "subject to regulation", as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not "subject to regulation."

(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy COe or more; or

(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy COe or more; and,

(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy COe; or

(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy COe, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy COe or more.

(ii) The term tpy COequivalent emissions (COe) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:

(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98-Global Warming Potentials.

(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy COe.

For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy COe, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and "significant" is defined as 75,000 tpy COe instead of applying the value in the EPA-approved Northern Sonoma County Air Pollution Control District rules at R1-1-130(s2).

(h)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in Mendocino County Air Quality Management District's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are "subject to regulation", as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not "subject to regulation."

(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy COe or more; or

(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy COe or more; and,

(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy COe; or

(iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in the EPA-approved Mendocino County Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in the Mendocino County Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(m1) (1982)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy COe, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and "significant" is defined as 75,000 tpy COe instead of applying the value in the EPA-approved Mendocino County Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2).
