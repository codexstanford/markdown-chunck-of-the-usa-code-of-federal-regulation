(D) Induction can plausibly be invoked as a factor in such effects where status may depend on the level of inducible enzymes present. Severalandmethods are available for assessment of enzyme induction, and the experiments which best address the issue at hand can be determined between Agency and industry scientists. If induction is demonstrated, the relationship of this phenomenon to toxicity observed from subchronic and/or chronic toxicity studies will need to be addressed.
