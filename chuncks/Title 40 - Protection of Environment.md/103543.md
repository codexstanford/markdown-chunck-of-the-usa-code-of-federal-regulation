######## &#x3BA;

(2) Convert measured instantaneous values to standard opacity values,based on the appropriate optical path length specified in Table 1 of ยง 1065.1125 using the following equation:

(3) Select opacity results from corrected measurements collected across test segments as follows:

(i) Divide measurements from acceleration and lugging modes into half-second intervals. Determine average opacity values during each half-second interval.

(ii) Identify the 15 highest half-second values during the acceleration mode of each test run.

(iii) Identify the five highest half-second values during the lugging mode of each test run.

(iv) Identify the three overall highest values from paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section for each test run.

(f) Determine percent opacity as follows:
