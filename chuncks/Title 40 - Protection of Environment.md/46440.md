####### Transmission configuration

means a unique combination, within a transmission class, of the number of the forward gears and, if applicable, overdrive. The Administrator may further subdivide a transmission configuration (based on such criteria as gear ratios, torque convertor multiplication ratio, stall speed and shift calibration, etc.), if he determines that significant fuel economy or exhaust emission differences exist within that transmission configuration.
