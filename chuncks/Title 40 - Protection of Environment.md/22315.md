###### 1.4 This method is "performance-based" and includes acceptability criteria for assessing sampling and analytical procedures.

Users may modify the method to overcome interferences or to substitute superior materials and equipment, provided that they meet all performance criteria in this method. Section 13 of this method presents requirements for method performance.

This method identifies and determines the concentration of specific PCDD, PCDF, PCB, and PAH compounds. Gaseous and particulate bound target pollutants are withdrawn from the gas stream isokinetically and collected in the sample probe, on a glass fiber or quartz filter, and on a packed column of adsorbent material. This method is not intended to differentiate between target compounds in particulate or vapor fractions. The target compounds are extracted from the combined sample collection media. Portions of the extract are chromatographically fractionated to remove interferences, separated into individual compounds or simple mixtures by HRGC, and measured with HRMS. This method uses isotopically labeled standards to improve method accuracy and precision through isotope dilution quantitation.
