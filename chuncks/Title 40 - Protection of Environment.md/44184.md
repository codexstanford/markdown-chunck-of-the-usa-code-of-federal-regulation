###### ยง 80.1466 What are the additional requirements under this subpart for foreign renewable fuel producers and importers of renewable fuels?
####### Comparison of load port and port of entry testing.

(e)(1)(i) Any RIN-generating foreign producer and any United States importer of RFS-FRRF shall compare the results from the load port testing under paragraph (d) of this section, with the port of entry testing as reported under paragraph (k) of this section, for the volume of renewable fuel, standardized per ยง 80.1426(f)(8), except as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) Where a vessel transporting RFS-FRRF offloads the renewable fuel at more than one United States port of entry, the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section do not apply at subsequent ports of entry if the United States importer obtains a certification from the vessel owner that the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section were met and that the vessel has not loaded any renewable fuel between the first United States port of entry and the subsequent ports of entry.

(2)(i) If the temperature-corrected volumes, after accounting for tank bottoms, determined at the port of entry and at the load port differ by more than one percent, the number of RINs associated with the renewable fuel shall be calculated based on the lesser of the two volumes in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.

(ii) Where the port of entry volume is the lesser of the two volumes in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the importer shall calculate the difference between the number of RINs originally assigned by the RIN-generating foreign producer and the number of RINs calculated under ยง 80.1426 for the volume of renewable fuel as measured at the port of entry, and acquire and retire that amount of RINs in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
