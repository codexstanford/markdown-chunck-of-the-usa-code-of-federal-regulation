####### Initial startup

means for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing of equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup of process units following malfunction or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations).
