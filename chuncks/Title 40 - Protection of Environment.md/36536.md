####### 13.1 Measurement Data Phase Performance Check.

Calculate the mean of the readings from the "measurement data phase". The maximum allowable deviation from the mean for each of the individual readings is +/-2 percent, or +/-1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive. Record the mean value and maximum deviation for each gas monitored. Data must conform to Section 10.1.4. The EC cell flow rate must conform to the specification in Section 8.3.
