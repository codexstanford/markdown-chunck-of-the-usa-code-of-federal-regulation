###### ยง 86.535-90 Dynamometer procedure.

(a) The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a "cold" start test and a "hot" start test following the "cold" start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the driving schedule, and engine shutdown make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and a continuously proportional sample is collected for analysis during each phase. The composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and, optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. A parallel sample of the dilution air is similarly analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and, optionally, for oxides of nitrogen. Methanol and formaldehyde samples (exhaust and dilution air) are collected and analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (a single dilution air formaldehyde sample covering the total time of the test may be collected in place of individual test phases).
