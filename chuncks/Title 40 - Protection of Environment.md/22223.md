###### 13.1 Calibration Error.

This specification is applicable to both the analyzer calibration error and the 3-point system calibration error tests described in section 8.2.3. At each calibration gas level (low, mid, and high) the calibration error must either be within +/-2.0 percent of the calibration span. Alternatively, the results are acceptable if |C- C| or |C-C| (as applicable) is &#x2264;0.5 ppmv.
