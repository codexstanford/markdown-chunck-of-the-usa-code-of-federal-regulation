###### ยง 52.128 Rule for unpaved parking lots, unpaved roads and vacant lots.
####### Stabilized surface

(16)-(i) Any unpaved road or unpaved parking lot surface where:

(A) Any fugitive dust plume emanating from vehicular movement does not exceed 20 percent opacity as determined in section I.A of Appendix A of this section; and

(B) Silt loading (weight of silt per unit area) is less than 0.33 ounces per square foot as determined by the test method in section I.B of Appendix A of this section OR where silt loading is greater than or equal to 0.33 ounces per square foot and silt content does not exceed six (6) percent for unpaved road surfaces or eight (8) percent for unpaved parking lot surfaces as determined by the test method in section I.B of Appendix A of this section.

(ii) Any vacant lot surface with:

(A) A visible crust which is sufficient as determined in section II.1 of Appendix A of this section;

(B) A threshold friction velocity (TFV), corrected for non-erodible elements, of 100 cm/second or higher as determined in section II.2 of Appendix A of this section;

(C) Flat vegetation cover equal to at least 50 percent as determined in section II.3 of Appendix A of this section;

(D) Standing vegetation cover equal to or greater than 30 percent as determined in section II.4 of Appendix A of this section; or

(E) Standing vegetation cover equal to or greater than 10 percent as determined in section II.4 of Appendix A of this section where threshold friction velocity, corrected for non-erodible elements, as determined in section II.2 of Appendix A of this section is equal to or greater than 43 cm/second.
