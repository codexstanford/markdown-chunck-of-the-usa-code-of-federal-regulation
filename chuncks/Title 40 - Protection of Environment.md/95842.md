####### Randomization.

(viii)The location of all test chambers within the test system shall be randomized. A representative sample of the test embryos should be impartially distributed by adding to each cup or screen tray no more than 20 percent of the number of embryos to be placed in each cup or screen tray and repeating the process until each cup or screen tray contains the specified number of embryos. Alternatively, the embryos can be assigned by random assignment of a small group (e.g., 1 to 5) of embryos to each embryo cup or screen tray, followed by random assignment of a second group of equal number to each cup or tray, which is continued until the appropriate number of embryos are contained in each embryo cup or screen tray. The method of randomization used shall be reported.
