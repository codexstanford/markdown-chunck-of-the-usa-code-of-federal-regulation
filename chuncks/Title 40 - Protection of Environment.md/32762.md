######## Secondary aluminum processing unit

(t). Except as provided in paragraph (u) of this section, the owner or operator must calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F (and HF for uncontrolled group 1 furnaces) for each secondary aluminum processing unit on a daily basis. To calculate the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average, the owner or operator must:

(1) Calculate and record the total weight of material charged to each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit for each 24-hour day of operation using the feed/charge weight information required in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator chooses to comply on the basis of weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, rather than weight of material charged to the emission unit, all performance test emissions results and all calculations must be conducted on the aluminum production weight basis.

(2) Multiply the total feed/charge weight to the emission unit, or the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, for each emission unit for the 24-hour period by the emission rate (in lb/ton of feed/charge) for that emission unit (as determined during the performance test) to provide emissions for each emission unit for the 24-hour period, in pounds.

(i) Where no performance test has been conducted, for a particular emission unit, because the owner of operator has, with the approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, chosen to determine the emission rate of an emission unit by testing a representative unit, in accordance with § 63.1511(f), the owner or operator shall use the emission rate determined from the representative unit in the SAPU emission rate calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4).

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (t)(2)(iii) of this section, if the owner or operator has not conducted performance tests for HCl (and HF for an uncontrolled group 1 furnace) or for HCl for an in-line fluxer, in accordance with the provisions of § 63.1512(d)(3), (e)(3), or (h)(2), the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine SAPU-wide HCl and HF emissions shall be made under the assumption that all chlorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HCl and all fluorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HF.

(iii) Prior to the date by which the initial performance test for HF emissions from uncontrolled group 1 furnaces is conducted, or is required to be conducted, the calculation required in § 63.1505(k) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission limit and the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission rate must exclude HF emissions from untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces and feed/charge processed in untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces.

(3) Divide the total emissions for each SAPU for the 24-hour period by the total material charged to the SAPU, or the weight of aluminum produced by the SAPU over the 24-hour period to provide the daily emission rate for the SAPU.

(4) Compute the 24-hour daily emission rate using Equation 4:

(5) Calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant each day by summing the daily emission rates for each pollutant over the 3 most recent consecutive days and dividing by 3. The SAPU is in compliance with an applicable emission limit if the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant is no greater than the applicable SAPU emission limit determined in accordance with § 63.1505(k)(1)-(3).
