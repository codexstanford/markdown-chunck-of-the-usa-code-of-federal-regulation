######## Replicate measurements and calculation of mean sampling effectiveness.

(8)(i) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(5) through (d)(7) of this section, as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three valid replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.

(ii) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the test sampler for the particle size as:

(iii) Sampling effectiveness precision. (A) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the test sampler as:

(B) If the value of CVexceeds 10 percent, the test run (steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section) must be repeated until an acceptable value is obtained.

(9) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section until the sampling effectiveness has been measured for all particle sizes specified in table F-2 of this subpart.

(10) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(9) of this section until tests have been successfully conducted for both wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr.
