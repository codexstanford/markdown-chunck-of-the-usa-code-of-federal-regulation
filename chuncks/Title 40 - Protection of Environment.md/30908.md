####### Monitoring for emission limits.

(c)The owner or operator of any affected source complying with the provisions of ยง 63.1254(a)(2) shall demonstrate continuous compliance with the 900 and 1,800 kg/yr emission limits by calculating daily 365-day rolling summations of emissions. During periods of planned routine maintenance when emissions are controlled as specified in ยง 63.1252(h), the owner or operator must calculate controlled emissions assuming the HAP emissions are reduced by 93 percent. For any owner or operator opting to switch compliance strategy from the 93 percent control requirement to the annual mass emission limit method, as described in ยง 63.1254(a)(1)(i), the rolling summations, beginning with the first day after the switch, must include emissions from the past 365 days.
