(d)(1) In addition to any requirements in 40 CFR part 25, the State shall hold public hearings as follows:

(i) Before submitting its priority system to the Regional Administrator for approval and before adopting any significant change to an approved priority system; and

(ii) Before submitting its annual project priority list to the Regional Administrator for acceptance and before revising its priority list unless the State agency and the Regional Administrator determine that the revision is not significant.

(iii) If the approved State priority system contains procedures for bypassing projects on the fundable portion of the priority list, such bypasses will not be significant revisions for purposes of this section.
