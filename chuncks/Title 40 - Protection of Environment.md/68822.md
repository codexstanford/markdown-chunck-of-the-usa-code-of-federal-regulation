####### Secondary containment for existing aboveground tanks.

(d)Existing aboveground tanks used to store or process used oil at processing and re-refining facilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system.

(1) The secondary containment system must consist of, at a minimum:

(i) Dikes, berms or retaining walls; and

(ii) A floor. The floor must cover the entire area within the dike, berm, or retaining wall except areas where existing portions of the tank meet the ground; or

(iii) An equivalent secondary containment system.

(2) The entire containment system, including walls and floor, must be sufficiently impervious to used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from migrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface water.
