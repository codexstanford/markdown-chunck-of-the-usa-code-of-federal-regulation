() If the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the NOallowances allocated to the NOBudget unit (as a NOBudget opt-in unit) under § 97.88 for the control period multiplied by the number of days in the control period starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period, and rounded to the nearest whole number of NOallowances as appropriate.

(B) The NOauthorized account representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the unit is located, contains the NOallowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain the necessary NOallowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOallowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOallowances are recorded in either account.

(iii)(A) For every control period during which the NOBudget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is in effect, the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be treated, solely for purposes of NOallowance allocations under § 97.42, as a unit that commenced operation on the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated NOallowances under § 97.42. The unit's deadline under § 97.84(b) for meeting monitoring requirements in accordance with subpart H of this part shall not be changed by the change in the unit's regulatory status or by the revision of the NOBudget permit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the following number of NOallowances will be allocated to the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section under § 97.42 for the control period: the number of NOallowances otherwise allocated to the NOBudget unit under § 97.42 for the control period multiplied by the number of days in the control period starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period, and rounded to the nearest whole number of NOallowances as appropriate.

(2)(i) When the NOauthorized account representative of a NOBudget opt-in unit does not renew its NOBudget opt-in permit under § 97.83(b), the Administrator will deduct from the NOBudget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the NOBudget opt-in unit is located, NOallowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any NOallowances allocated to the NOBudget opt-in unit under § 97.88 for any control period after the last control period for which the NOBudget opt-in permit is effective. The NOauthorized account representative shall ensure that the NOBudget opt-in unit's compliance account or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the NOBudget opt-in unit is located contains the NOallowances necessary for completion of such deduction. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain the necessary NOallowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOallowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOallowances are recorded in either account.

(ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is completed, the Administrator will close the NOBudget opt-in unit's compliance account. If any NOallowances remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and any deduction under § 97.54, the Administrator will close the NOBudget opt-in unit's compliance account and transfer any remaining allowances to a general account specified by the owners and operators of the NOBudget opt-in unit.
