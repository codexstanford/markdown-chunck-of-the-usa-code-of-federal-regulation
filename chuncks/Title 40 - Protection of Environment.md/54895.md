####### Adjustment of effluent standard for presence of PCBs in intake water.

(e)Whenever a facility which is subject to these standards has PCBs in its effluent which result from the presence of PCBs in its intake waters, the owner may apply to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate), for a credit pursuant to the provisions of ยง 129.6, where the source of the water supply is the same body of water into which the discharge is made. The requirement of paragraph (1) of ยง 129.6(a), relating to the source of the water supply, shall be waived, and such facility shall be eligible to apply for a credit under ยง 129.6, upon a showing by the owner or operator of such facility to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) that the concentration of PCBs in the intake water supply of such facility does not exceed the concentration of PCBs in the receiving water body to which the plant discharges its effluent.
