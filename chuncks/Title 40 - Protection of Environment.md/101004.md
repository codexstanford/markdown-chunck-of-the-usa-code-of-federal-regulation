###### ยง 1042.505 Testing engines using discrete-mode or ramped-modal duty cycles.
####### Variable-speed auxiliary engines.

(5)(i) Use the duty cycle specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for propeller-law auxiliary engines.

(ii) Use the 6-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (b) for variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power below 19 kW that are not propeller-law engines.

(iii) Use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (c) for variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power at or above 19 kW that are not propeller-law engines.

(c) For constant-speed engines whose design prevents full-load operation for extended periods, you may ask for approval under 40 CFR 1065.10(c) to replace full-load operation with the maximum load for which the engine is designed to operate for extended periods.
