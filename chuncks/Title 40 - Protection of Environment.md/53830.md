####### Benefits Valuation Study.

(11)The owner or operator of an existing facility that withdraws greater than 125 mgd AIF must develop for submission to the Director an evaluation of the benefits of the candidate entrainment reduction technologies and operational measures evaluated in paragraph (r)(10) of this section including using the Entrainment Characterization Study completed in paragraph (r)(9) of this section. Each category of benefits must be described narratively, and when possible, benefits should be quantified in physical or biological units and monetized using appropriate economic valuation methods. The benefits valuation study must include, but is not limited to, the following elements:

(i) Incremental changes in the numbers of individual fish and shellfish lost due to impingement mortality and entrainment as defined in 40 CFR 125.92, for all life stages of each exposed species;

(ii) Description of basis for any estimates of changes in the stock sizes or harvest levels of commercial and recreational fish or shellfish species or forage fish species;

(iii) Description of basis for any monetized values assigned to changes in the stock size or harvest levels of commercial and recreational fish or shellfish species, forage fish, and to any other ecosystem or non use benefits;

(iv) A discussion of mitigation efforts completed prior to October 14, 2014 including how long they have been in effect and how effective they have been;

(v) Discussion, with quantification and monetization, where possible, of any other benefits expected to accrue to the environment and local communities, including but not limited to improvements for mammals, birds, and other organisms and aquatic habitats;

(vi) Discussion, with quantification and monetization, where possible, of any benefits expected to result from any reductions in thermal discharges from entrainment technologies.
