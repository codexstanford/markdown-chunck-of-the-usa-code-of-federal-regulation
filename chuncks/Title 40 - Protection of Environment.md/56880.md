(b) EPA has stayed this section as it relates to the total coliform MCL of ยง 141.63(a) of this chapter for systems that demonstrate to the State that the violation of the total coliform MCL is due to a persistent growth of total coliforms in the distribution system rather than fecal or pathogenic contamination, a treatment lapse or deficiency, or a problem in the operation or maintenance of the distribution system. This stay is applicable until March 31, 2016, at which time the total coliform MCL is no longer applicable.
