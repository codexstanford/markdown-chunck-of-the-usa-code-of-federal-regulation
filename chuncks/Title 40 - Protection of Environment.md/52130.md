####### Sample each process.

(4)If process vents from separate processes are manifolded together to a common vent or to a common destruction device, you must follow paragraph (c)(4)(i), (c)(4)(ii), or (c)(4)(iii) of this section.

(i) You may sample emissions from each process in the ducts before the emissions are combined.

(ii) You may sample in the common duct or at the outlet of the destruction device when only one process is operating.

(iii) You may sample the combined emissions and use engineering calculations and assessments as specified in ยง 98.123(c)(4) to allocate the emissions to each manifolded process vent, provided the sum of the calculated fluorinated GHG emissions across the individual process vents is within 20 percent of the total fluorinated GHG emissions measured during the manifolded testing.
