######## Additional credits for vehicles certified to 150,000 mile useful lives.

(g)(1) A manufacturer may certify any test group to an optional useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

(2)(i) For any test group certified to the optional 15 year/150,000 mile useful life, the manufacturer may generate additional NOcredits, except as prohibited in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

(ii) The manufacturer must calculate these extra NOcredits, where permitted, by substituting an adjusted NOstandard for the applicable NOstandard from the full useful life certification bin when it calculates the applicable fleet average NOemissions by the procedure in paragraph (f) of this section. The adjusted standard must be equal to the applicable full useful life NOstandard multiplied by 0.85 and rounded to one more decimal place than the number of decimal places as the applicable full useful life NOstandard.

(3) A manufacturer electing not to comply with applicable intermediate life standards as permitted under § 86.1811-04(c)(4) may not generate additional credits from vehicles certified to a useful life of 15 years/150,000 miles; except that, for bins where such intermediate life standards do not exist or are specifically deemed to be optional in § 86.1811-04(c)(4), the manufacturer may generate additional NOcredits from vehicles certified to a useful life of 15 years/150,000 miles.
