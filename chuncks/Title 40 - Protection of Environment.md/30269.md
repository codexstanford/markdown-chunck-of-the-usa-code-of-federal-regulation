######## Cl,HCl ratios,Ratio for calculating annual average HCl-equivalent emission rates.

(6)-(i)(A) To calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) for each combustor, you must apportion the total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride (Cl) equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the historical average Cl/HCl volumetric ratio for all regulatory compliance tests.

(B) You must calculate HCl and Clemission rates (lb/hr) using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.

(C) You must calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate using these HCl and Clemission rates and the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
