######## i.e.,

(b) If you are subject to an operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart, you demonstrate initial compliance with HAP metals or filterable PM emission limit(s) through performance stack tests and you elect to use a PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous performance, or if, for a liquid oil-fired EGU, and you use quarterly stack testing for HCl and HF plus site-specific parameter monitoring to demonstrate continuous performance, you must also establish a site-specific operating limit, in accordance with ยง 63.10007 and Table 6 to this subpart. You may use only the parametric data recorded during successful performance tests (tests that demonstrate compliance with the applicable emissions limits) to establish an operating limit.
