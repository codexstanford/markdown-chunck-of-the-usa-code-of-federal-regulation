###### ยง 98.325 Procedures for estimating missing data.
####### e.g.,

(a) A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (if a meter malfunctions during unit operation or if a required fuel sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall be used in the calculations, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) For each missing value of CHconcentration, flow rate, temperature, pressure, and moisture content for ventilation and degasification systems, the substitute data value shall be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident. If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value shall be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period.
