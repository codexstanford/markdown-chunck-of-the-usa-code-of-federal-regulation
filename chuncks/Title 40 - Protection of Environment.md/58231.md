(b)Each registration issued under ยง 152.114 shall be conditioned upon the applicant's agreement to each of the following conditions:

(1) The applicant will submit remaining required data (and interim reports if required) in accordance with a schedule approved by the Agency.

(2) The registration will expire upon a date established by the Agency, if the registrant fails to submit data as required by the Agency.

(3) The applicant will submit an annual report of the production of the product.
