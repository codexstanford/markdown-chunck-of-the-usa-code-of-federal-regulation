####### ยง 60.2145 How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
######## i.e.,

(ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and

(iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentrations increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.

(2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in ยง 60.2110.

(3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps.

(4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or their digital equivalent).

(5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (x)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.

(6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:

(i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);

(ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report);

(iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.

(7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.

(8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:

(i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;

(ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;

(iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit. Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under paragraph (x) of this section; and

(iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.

(y) When there is an alkali bypass and/or an in-line coal mill that exhaust emissions through a separate stack(s), the combined emissions are subject to the emission limits applicable to waste-burning kilns. To determine the kiln-specific emission limit for demonstrating compliance, you must:

(1) Calculate a kiln-specific emission limit using equation 7:

(2) Particulate matter concentration must be measured downstream of the in-line coal mill. All other pollutant concentrations must be measured either upstream or downstream of the in-line coal mill; and

(3) For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS or PM CPMS on the alkali bypass stack or in-line coal mill stack, the results of the initial and subsequent performance test can be used to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit. A performance test must be conducted on an annual basis (no later than 13 calendar months following the previous performance test).
