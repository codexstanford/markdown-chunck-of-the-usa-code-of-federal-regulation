####### Initial certification and recertification procedures.

(c)Prior to the deadline in ยง 75.4, the owner or operator shall conduct initial certification tests and in accordance with ยง 75.63, the designated representative shall submit an application to demonstrate that the continuous emission or opacity monitoring system and components thereof meet the specifications in appendix A to this part. The owner or operator shall compare reference method values with output from the automated data acquisition and handling system that is part of the continuous emission monitoring system being tested. Except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (d), and (e) of this section, and in sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 of appendix A to this part, the owner or operator shall perform the following tests for initial certification or recertification of continuous emission or opacity monitoring systems or components according to the requirements of appendix A to this part:

(1) For each SOpollutant concentration monitor, each NOconcentration monitoring system used to determine NOmass emissions, as defined under ยง 75.71(a)(2), and each NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system:

(i) A 7-day calibration error test, where, for the NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, the test is performed separately on the NOpollutant concentration monitor and the diluent gas monitor;

(ii) A linearity check, where, for the NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, the test is performed separately on the NOpollutant concentration monitor and the diluent gas monitor;

(iii) A relative accuracy test audit. For the NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, the RATA shall be done on a system basis, in units of lb/mmBtu. For the NOconcentration monitoring system, the RATA shall be done on a ppm basis;

(iv) A bias test;

(v) A cycle time test, (where, for the NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, the test is performed separately on the NOpollutant concentration monitor and the diluent gas monitor); and

(2) For each flow monitor:

(i) A 7-day calibration error test;

(ii) Relative accuracy test audits, as follows:

(A) A single-load (or single-level) RATA at the normal load (or level), as defined in section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part, for a flow monitor installed on a peaking unit or bypass stack, or for a flow monitor exempted from multiple-level RATA testing under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part;

(B) For all other flow monitors, a RATA at each of the three load levels (or operating levels) corresponding to the three flue gas velocities described in section 6.5.2(a) of appendix A to this part;

(iii) A bias test for the single-load (or single-level) flow RATA described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section; and

(iv) A bias test (or bias tests) for the 3-level flow RATA described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, at the following load or operational level(s):

(A) At each load level designated as normal under section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part, for units that produce electrical or thermal output, or

(B) At the operational level identified as normal in section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part, for units that do not produce electrical or thermal output.

(3) The initial certification test data from an Oor a COdiluent gas monitor certified for use in a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system may be submitted to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Also, for a diluent monitor that is used both as a COmonitoring system and to determine heat input, only one set of diluent monitor certification data need be submitted (under the component and system identification numbers of the COmonitoring system).

(4) For each COpollutant concentration monitor, each COmonitoring system that uses an Omonitor to determine COconcentration, and each diluent gas monitor used only to monitor heat input rate:

(i) A 7-day calibration error test;

(ii) A linearity check;

(iii) A relative accuracy test audit, where, for an Omonitor used to determine COconcentration, the COreference method shall be used for the RATA; and

(iv) A cycle-time test.

(5) For each continuous moisture monitoring system consisting of wet- and dry-basis Oanalyzers:

(i) A 7-day calibration error test of each Oanalyzer;

(ii) A cycle time test of each Oanalyzer;

(iii) A linearity test of each Oanalyzer; and

(iv) A RATA, directly comparing the percent moisture measured by the monitoring system to a reference method.

(6) For each continuous moisture sensor: A RATA, directly comparing the percent moisture measured by the monitor sensor to a reference method.

(7) For a continuous moisture monitoring system consisting of a temperature sensor and a data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) software component programmed with a moisture lookup table:

(i) A demonstration that the correct moisture value for each hour is being taken from the moisture lookup tables and applied to the emission calculations. At a minimum, the demonstration shall be made at three different temperatures covering the normal range of stack temperatures from low to high.

(ii) [Reserved]

(8) The owner or operator shall ensure that initial certification or recertification of a continuous opacity monitor for use under the Acid Rain Program is conducted according to one of the following procedures:

(i) Performance of the tests for initial certification or recertification, according to the requirements of Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter; or

(ii) A continuous opacity monitoring system tested and certified previously under State or other Federal requirements to meet the requirements of Performance Specification 1 shall be deemed certified for the purposes of this part.

(9) [Reserved]

(10) For the automated data acquisition and handling system, tests designed to verify:

(i) Proper computation of hourly averages for pollutant concentrations, flow rate, pollutant emission rates, and pollutant mass emissions; and

(ii) Proper computation and application of the missing data substitution procedures in subpart D of this part and the bias adjustment factors in section 7 of appendix A to this part.

(11) The owner or operator shall provide adequate facilities for initial certification or recertification testing that include:

(i) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such facility, such that:

(A) Volumetric flow rate, pollutant concentration, and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures; and

(B) A stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests is available, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.

(ii) Basic facilities (e.g., electricity) for sampling and testing equipment.
