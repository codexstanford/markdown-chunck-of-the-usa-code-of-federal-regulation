####### Sampling and mass measurement for emission testing.

(1)For emission testing in process vents or at the stack, use methods for sampling, measuring volumetric flow rates, non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis, and measuring stack gas moisture that have been validated using a scientifically sound validation protocol.

(i) Sample and velocity traverses. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to EPA Method 1 or 1A in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.

(ii) Velocity and volumetric flow rates. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to EPA Method 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60. Alternatives that may be used for determining flow rates include OTM-24 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7) and ALT-012 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7).

(iii) Non-fluorinated-GHG gas analysis. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.

(iv) Stack gas moisture. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to EPA Method 4 in Appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.
