####### Approval of site-specific test plan.

(3)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original plan and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Before disapproving any site-specific test plan, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the plan together with-

(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and

(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended disapproval, additional information to the Administrator before final action on the plan.

(ii) In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific test plan within the time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following conditions shall apply:

(A) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the test method(s) specified in the relevant standard or with only minor changes to those tests methods (see paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), the owner or operator must conduct the performance test within the time specified in this section using the specified method(s);

(B) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method when the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) or after the alternative method is approved (see paragraph (f) of this section). However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval 45 days after submission of the site-specific test plan or request to use an alternative method. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.

(iii) Neither the submission of a site-specific test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall-

(A) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or

(B) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
