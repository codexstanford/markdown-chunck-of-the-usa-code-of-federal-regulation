###### General.

Use Schedule D.5 to calculate cash proceeds from liquidation. Applicants should determine the current salvage value of their existing investment in the smelter as the net proceeds that could be derived through an orderly liquidation of the smelter's assets. The net cash proceeds should be reported after an appropriate allowance for disposal costs, contractual claims against the smelter (e.g., labor termination penalties), and income tax effects on the corporation of such liquidation costs.

The applicant must stipulate the most advantageous alternative market (use) for the smelter's facilities. Generally, this market will be:

Secondary market for used plant and equipment.

Sale for scrap.

Abandonment where the disposal cost exceeds scrap value.

The current net salvage value should be disaggregated into the same property, plant and equipment asset groups reported under the historical capital investment summary, Schedule A.4. The line items in Schedule D.5 are explained in the following instructions.
