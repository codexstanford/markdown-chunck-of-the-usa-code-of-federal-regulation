######## Higher ranges.,i.e.,

(i)The tests may be repeated for one or more higher (broader) ranges (ranges extending to higher concentrations) than the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, provided that the range does not extend to concentrations more than four times the upper range limit of the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. For such higher ranges, only the tests for range (calibration), noise at 80% of the upper range limit, and lag, rise and fall time are required to be repeated. For the purpose of testing a higher range, the test procedure of ยง 53.23(e) may be abridged to include only those components needed to test lag, rise and fall time.
