####### Performance test.

(ii)An owner or operator shall conduct performance tests following the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, or a combination of the two procedures. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, a performance test is conducted for each batch emission episode selected for control. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, an owner or operator groups together several batch emission episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch emission episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving emission reductions, for the control device or control technology; thereby demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the tested batch emission episode is the minimum control device or control technology performance expected for each batch emission episode in the group. An owner or operator may use the concept provided by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for several different groups of batch emission episodes.
