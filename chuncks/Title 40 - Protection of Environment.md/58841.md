###### ยง 158.2010 Biochemical pesticides data requirements.

(a) Sections 158.2030 through 158.2070 identify the data requirements that are required to support registration of biochemical pesticides. Sections 158.2080 through 158.2084 identify the data requirements that are required to support Experimental Use Permits (EUPs). Variations in the test conditions are identified within the test notes. Definitions that apply to all biochemical data requirements can be found in ยง 158.2000.

(b) Each data table includes "use patterns" under which the individual data are required, with variations including food and nonfood uses for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, forestry, and residential outdoor applications under certain circumstances.

(c) The categories for each data requirement are "R", which stands for required, and "CR" which stands for conditionally required. Generally, "R" indicates that the data are more likely required than for those data requirements with "CR." However, in each case, the regulatory text preceding the data table and the test notes following the data table must be used to determine whether the data requirement must be satisfied.
