(7) ASME MFC-18M-2001 Measurement of Fluid Flow using Variable Area Meters (incorporated by reference,ยง 98.7).

(8) Method 2A or 2D at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1.

(i) All temperature, pressure, and, moisture content monitors required as specified in paragraph (f) of this section must be calibrated using the procedures and frequencies where specified by the device manufacturer, if not specified use an industry accepted or industry standard practice.

(j) All equipment (temperature, pressure, and moisture content monitors and gas flow meters and gas composition monitors) must be maintained as specified by the manufacturer.

(k) If applicable, the owner or operator must document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of measurements of COD or BODconcentration, wastewater flow rate, biogas flow rate, biogas composition, temperature, pressure, and moisture content. These procedures include, but are not limited to, calibration of gas flow meters, and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices must also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates must be documented.
