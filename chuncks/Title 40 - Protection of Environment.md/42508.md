######## Unit utilizing common stack with other affected unit(s).

(a)When an affected unit utilizes a common stack with one or more affected units, but no nonaffected units, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each affected unit; or

(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system in the common stack and follow the appropriate procedure in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, depending on whether or not the units are required to comply with a NOemission limitation (in lb/mmBtu, annual average basis) pursuant to section 407(b) of the Act (referred to hereafter as "NOemission limitation").

(i) When each of the affected units has a NOemission limitation, the designated representative shall submit a compliance plan to the Administrator that indicates:

(A) Each unit will comply with the most stringent NOemission limitation of any unit utilizing the common stack; or

(B) Each unit will comply with the applicable NOemission limitation by averaging its emissions with the other unit(s) utilizing the common stack, pursuant to the emissions averaging plan submitted under part 76 of this chapter; or

(C) Each unit's compliance with the applicable NOemission limit will be determined by a method satisfactory to the Administrator for apportioning to each of the units the combined NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured in the common stack and for reporting the NOemission rate, as provided in a petition submitted by the designated representative. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning and reporting NOemission rate measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures that there is a complete and accurate estimation of all emissions regulated under this part and, in particular, that the emissions from any unit with a NOemission limitation are not underestimated.

(ii) When none of the affected units has a NOemission limitation, the owner or operator and the designated representative have no additional obligations pursuant to section 407 of the Act and may record and report a combined NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the affected units utilizing the common stack.

(iii) When at least one of the affected units has a NOemission limitation and at least one of the affected units does not have a NOemission limitation, the owner or operator shall either:

(A) Install, certify, operate, and maintain NOand diluent monitors in the ducts from the affected units; or

(B) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured in the common stack on each of the units. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning the combined NOemission rate measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures complete and accurate estimation of all emissions regulated under this part.
