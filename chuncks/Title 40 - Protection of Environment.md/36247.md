###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements for Puncture Sealant Application Affected Sources
####### ยง 63.6000 How do I conduct tests and procedures for puncture sealant application affected sources?
######## Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2.

(d)Use the equations in this paragraph (d) to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the HAP constituent emission limits for puncture sealant application affected sources using the compliance alternatives described in ยง 63.5989(c) and (d).

(1) Use Equation 2 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using puncture sealants without using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 2 follows:

(2) Use Equation 3 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using puncture sealants by using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 3 follows:

(3) Each monthly calculation is a compliance demonstration for the purpose of this subpart.
