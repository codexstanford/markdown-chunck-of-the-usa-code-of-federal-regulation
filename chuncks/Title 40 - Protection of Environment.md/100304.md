(2) Declare fuel masses,and. Determineusing the calculated fuel mass consumption values described in 40 CFR 1036.540(d)(12). In addition, declare mean fuel mass flow rate for each applicable idle duty cycle,. These declared values may not be lower than any corresponding measured values determined in this section. If you use both direct and indirect measurement of fuel flow, determine the corresponding declared values as described in 40 CFR 1036.535(g)(2) and (3).
