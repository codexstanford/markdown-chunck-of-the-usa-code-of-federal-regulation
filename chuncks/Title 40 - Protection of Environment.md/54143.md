##### Subpart C - Permit Conditions
###### ยง 122.45 Calculating NPDES permit conditions (applicable to State NPDES programs, see ยง 123.25).
####### Mass limitations.

(f)(1) All pollutants limited in permits shall have limitations, standards or prohibitions expressed in terms of mass except:

(i) For pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed by mass;

(ii) When applicable standards and limitations are expressed in terms of other units of measurement; or

(iii) If in establishing permit limitations on a case-by-case basis under ยง 125.3, limitations expressed in terms of mass are infeasible because the mass of the pollutant discharged cannot be related to a measure of operation (for example, discharges of TSS from certain mining operations), and permit conditions ensure that dilution will not be used as a substitute for treatment.

(2) Pollutants limited in terms of mass additionally may be limited in terms of other units of measurement, and the permit shall require the permittee to comply with both limitations.
