###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from continuous monitoring of manifolded group of centrifugal compressor sources.

(9)For a manifolded group of compressor sources measured according to paragraph (o)(1)(iv) of this section, you must use the continuous volumetric emission measurements taken as specified in paragraph (o)(5) of this section and calculate annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources using Equation W-24C of this section. If the centrifugal compressors included in the manifolded group of compressor sources share the manifold with reciprocating compressors, you must follow the procedures in either this paragraph (o)(9) or paragraph (p)(9) of this section to calculate emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources.
