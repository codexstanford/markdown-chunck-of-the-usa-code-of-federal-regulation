####### Dilution water,General.,1

(vii)-(A)() A constant supply of acceptable dilution water should be available for use throughout the test. Dilution water shall be of a minimum quality such that the test species selected will survive in it for the duration of testing without showing signs of stress (e.g., loss of pigmentation, disorientation, poor response to external stimuli, excessive mucous secretion, lethargy, lack of feeding, or other unusual behavior). A better criterion for an acceptable dilution water for tests on early life stages should be such that the species selected for testing will survive, grow, and reproduce satisfactorily in it.
