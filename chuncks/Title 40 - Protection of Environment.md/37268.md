(2) Sum the actual emissions for all of the process vessels in the emissions averaging group every three months, with the first 3-month period beginning on the compliance date, and compare the resulting total with the total emissions for the vessels calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance is demonstrated if the sum of the actual emissions is less than the emissions estimated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
