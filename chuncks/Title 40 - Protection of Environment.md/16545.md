Enter any adjustments to net income not included in Schedule D.3. When assuming closure after January 1, 1988, the applicant must include the proceeds from liquidation in 1988. The applicant must estimate liquidation value as of 1988 using one of two methods: (1) the applicant may complete Schedule D.5 assuming liquidation in 1988 and report the value of after-tax cash proceeds in Line 17; or (2) the applicant may use the value of after-tax cash proceeds in Line 17 of Schedule D.5, as already completed, assuming liquidation in the current (application) year, and expressing values in 1988 dollars. The current liquidation value must be inflated to 1988 dollars by applying the appropriate forecast percentage rate changes in the GNP price deflator. Attach explanatory supporting schedules in Exhibit B.
