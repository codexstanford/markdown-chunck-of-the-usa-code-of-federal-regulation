####### i.e.,
######## Volumetric flow rate, NO,emission rate and NO,concentration data.,i.e.

(c)Use the procedures in this paragraph to provide substitute NOand flow rate data for all affected units for which load-based ranges have been defined in accordance with section 2 of appendix C to this part. For units that do not produce electrical or thermal output (, non-load-based units), use the procedures in this paragraph only to provide substitute data for volumetric flow rate, and only if operational bins have been defined for the unit, as described in section 3 of appendix C to this part. Otherwise, use the applicable missing data procedures in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section for non-load-based units. For each hour of missing volumetric flow rate data, NOemission rate data, or NOconcentration data used to determine NOmass emissions:

(1) If the monitor data availability is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:

(i) For a missing data period less than or equal to 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the arithmetic average of the flow rates or NOemission rates or NOconcentrations recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.

(ii) For a missing data period greater than 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the greater of:

(A) The 90th percentile hourly flow rate or the 90th percentile NOemission rate or the 90th percentile NOconcentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part; or

(B) The average of the recorded hourly flow rates, NOemission rates or NOconcentrations recorded by a monitoring system for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.

(2) If the monitor data availability is at least 90.0 percent but less than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:

(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to 8 hours, substitute, as applicable, the arithmetic average hourly flow rate or NOemission rate or NOconcentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.

(ii) For a missing data period greater than 8 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the greater of:

(A) The 95th percentile hourly flow rate or the 95th percentile NOemission rate or the 95th percentile NOconcentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part; or

(B) The average of the hourly flow rates, NOemission rates or NOconcentrations recorded by a monitoring system for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.

(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NOemission rate or the maximum hourly NOconcentration recorded during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.

(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum NOemission rate, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum potential NOconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. In addition, when non-load-based operational bins are used, the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential flow rate for any hour in the missing data period in which essential operating or parametric data are unavailable and the operational bin cannot be determined.

(5) This paragraph, (c)(5), does not apply to non-load-based, affected units using operational bins. Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NOconcentration data or NOemission rate data exist for the corresponding load range, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for each hour of missing data, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NOconcentration or maximum hourly NOemission rate at the next higher level load range for which quality-assured data are available.

(6) Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NOconcentration data or NOemission rate data exist at either the corresponding load range (or a higher load range) or at the corresponding operational bin, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, either the maximum potential NOemission rate or the maximum potential NOconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part or the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part.

(7) This paragraph (c)(7) does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. For units that combust more than one type of fuel, the owner or operator may opt to implement the missing data routines in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis. If this option is selected, the owner or operator shall document this in the monitoring plan required under ยง 75.53.

(8) This paragraph, (c)(8), does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. Use the following guidelines to implement paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis:

(i) Separate the historical, quality-assured NOemission rate, NOconcentration, or flow rate data according to the type of fuel combusted;

(ii) For units that co-fire different types of fuel, either group the co-fired hours with the historical data for the fuel with the highest NOemission rate, NOconcentration or flow rate, or separate the co-fired hours from the single-fuel hours;

(iii) For the purposes of providing substitute data under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a separate, fuel-specific maximum potential concentration (MPC), maximum potential NOemission rate (MER), or maximum potential flow rate (MPF) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, in a manner consistent with ยง 72.2 of this chapter and with section 2.1.2.1 or 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part. For co-firing, the MPC, MER or MPF value shall be based on the fuel with the highest emission rate or flow rate (as applicable). Furthermore, for a unit with add-on NOemission controls, a separate fuel-specific maximum controlled NOemission rate (MCR) or maximum expected NOconcentration (MEC) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit. The exact methodology used to determine each fuel-specific MPC, MER, MEC, MCR or MPF value shall be documented in the monitoring plan for the unit or stack.

(iv) For missing data periods that require 2,160-hour (or, if applicable, 3-year) lookbacks, use historical data for the type of fuel combusted during each hour of the missing data period to determine the appropriate substitute data value for that hour. For co-fired missing data hours, if the historical data are separated into single-fuel and co-fired hours, use co-fired data to provide the substitute data values. Otherwise, use data for the fuel with the highest NOemission rate, NOconcentration or flow rate (as applicable) to provide substitute data values for co-fired missing data hours. Tables 1 and 2 follow.

(9) The load-based provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section are summarized in Table 2 of this section. The non-load-based provisions for volumetric flow rate, found in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4), and (c)(6) of this section, are presented in Table 4 of this section.
