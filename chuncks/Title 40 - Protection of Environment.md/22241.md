Figure 7E-1 of Method 7E is a schematic diagram of an acceptable measurement system. The components are the same as those in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Method 7E, except that the CO analyzer described in section 6.2 of this method must be used instead of the analyzer described in section 6.2 of Method 7E. You must follow the noted specifications in section 6.1 of Method 7E except that the requirements to use stainless steel, Teflon, or non-reactive glass filters do not apply. Also, a heated sample line is not required to transport dry gases or for systems that measure the CO concentration on a dry basis.
