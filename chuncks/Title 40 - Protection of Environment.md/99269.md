###### ยง 1033.135 Labeling.

As described in this section, each locomotive must have a label on the locomotive and a separate label on the engine. The label on the locomotive stays on the locomotive throughout its service life. It generally identifies the original certification of the locomotive, which is when it was originally manufactured for Tier 1 and later locomotives. The label on the engine is replaced each time the locomotive is remanufactured and identifies the most recent certification.
