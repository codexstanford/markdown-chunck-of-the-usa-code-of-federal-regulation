###### ยง 1065.645 Amount of water in an ideal gas.
####### Vapor pressure of water.,T

(a)Calculate the vapor pressure of water for a given saturation temperature condition,, as follows, or use good engineering judgment to use a different relationship of the vapor pressure of water to a given saturation temperature condition:

(1) For humidity measurements made at ambient temperatures from (0 to 100) &#xB0;C, or for humidity measurements made over super-cooled water at ambient temperatures from (-50 to 0) &#xB0;C, use the following equation:

(2) For humidity measurements over ice at ambient temperatures from (-100 to 0) &#xB0;C, use the following equation:
