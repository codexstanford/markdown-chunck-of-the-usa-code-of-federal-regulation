####### ยง 1065.266 Fourier transform infrared analyzer.
######## Interference verification.

(e)Perform interference verification for FTIR analyzers using the procedures of ยง 1065.366. Certain interference gases can interfere with FTIR analyzers by causing a response similar to the hydrocarbon species of interest. When running the interference verification for these analyzers, use interference gases as follows:

(1) The interference gases for CHare CO, HO, and CH.

(2) The interference gases for CHare CO, HO, and CH.

(3) The interference gases for other measured hydrocarbon species are CO, HO, CH, and CH.
