() You maintain records of all information regarding your choice of emission limits.

(B) You must begin to use the revised emission limits starting in the next reporting period, after receipt of written acknowledgement from the Administrator of the switch.

(C) From submission of your request until start of the next reporting period after receipt of written acknowledgement from the Administrator of the switch, you must demonstrate compliance with both the mass per heat input and mass per gross output emission limits for each pollutant for each EGU or EGU emissions averaging group.

(8) Identification of whether you plan to rely on paragraph (1) or (2) of the definition of "startup" in ยง 63.10042.

(i) Should you choose to rely on paragraph (2) of the definition of "startup" in ยง 63.10042 for your EGU, you shall include a report that identifies:

(A) The original EGU installation date;

(B) The original EGU design characteristics, including, but not limited to, fuel mix and PM controls;

(C) Each design PM control device efficiency established during performance testing or while operating in periods other than startup and shutdown periods;

(D) The design PM emission rate from the EGU in terms of pounds PM per MMBtu and pounds PM per hour established during performance testing or while operating in periods other than startup and shutdown periods;

(E) The design time from start of fuel combustion to necessary conditions for each PM control device startup;

(F) Each design PM control device efficiency upon startup of the PM control device, if different from the efficiency provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(C) of this section;

(G) Current EGU PM producing characteristics, including, but not limited to, fuel mix and PM controls, if different from the characteristics provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(B) of this section;

(H) Current PM control device efficiency from each PM control device, if different from the efficiency provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(C) of this section;

(I) Current PM emission rate from the EGU in terms of pounds PM per MMBtu and pounds per hour, if different from the rate provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(D) of this section;

(J) Current time from start of fuel combustion to conditions necessary for each PM control device startup, if different from the time provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(E) of this section; and

(K) Current PM control device efficiency upon startup of each PM control device, if different from the efficiency provided in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(H) of this section.

(ii) The report shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the state where your EGU is located.

(iii) You may switch from paragraph (1) of the definition of "startup" in ยง 63.10042 to paragraph (2) of the definition of "startup" (or vice-versa), provided that:

(A) You submit a request that identifies for each EGU or EGU emissions averaging group involved in the proposed switch both the current definition of "startup" relied on and the proposed definition you plan to rely on;

(B) Your request arrives to the Administrator at least 30 calendar days prior to the date that the switch is proposed to occur;
