###### ยง 80.1426 How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel?
####### Standardization of volumes.

(8)In determining the standardized volume of a batch of renewable fuel for purposes of generating RINs under this paragraph (f), the batch volumes shall be adjusted to a standard temperature of 60 &#xB0;F.

(i) For ethanol, the following formula shall be used:

(ii) For biodiesel (mono-alkyl esters), one of the following two methods for biodiesel temperature standardization to 60 &#xB0;Fahrenheit (&#xB0;F) shall be used

(B) The standardized volume of biodiesel at 60 &#xB0;F, in gallons, as calculated from the use of the American Petroleum Institute Refined Products Table 6B, as referenced in ASTM D1250 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 80.1468).

(iii) For other renewable fuels, an appropriate formula commonly accepted by the industry shall be used to standardize the actual volume to 60 &#xB0;F. Formulas used must be reported to EPA, and may be determined to be inappropriate.
