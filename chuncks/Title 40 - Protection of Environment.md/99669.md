####### Fuel maps for the transition to updated GEM.

(r)(1) You may use fuel maps from model year 2023 and earlier engines for certifying model year 2024 and later engines using carryover provisions in ยง 1036.235(d).

(2) Compliance testing will be based on the GEM version you used to generate fuel maps for certification. For example, if you perform a selective enforcement audit with respect to fuel maps, use the same GEM version that you used to generate fuel maps for certification. Similarly, we will use the same GEM version that you used to generate fuel maps for certification if we perform confirmatory testing with one of your engine families.
