####### Concentration levels and concentration selection.

(5)(i) In subchronic toxicity tests, it is desirable to have a concentration-response relationship as well as a NOEL. Therefore, at least three concentration levels plus a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest exposure level) shall be used. Concentrations should be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a concentration-response curve.

(ii) The highest concentration should result in toxic effects but not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful evaluation.

(iii) The intermediate concentrations should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.

(iv) The lowest concentration should produce no evidence of toxicity.

(v) In the case of potentially explosive test substances, care should be taken to avoid generating explosive concentrations.
