####### Electrodeposition of paint

means the application of a coating using a water-based electrochemical bath process. The component being coated is immersed in a bath of the coating. An electric potential is applied between the component and an oppositely charged electrode hanging in the bath. The electric potential causes the ionized coating to be electrically attracted, migrated, and deposited on the component being coated.
