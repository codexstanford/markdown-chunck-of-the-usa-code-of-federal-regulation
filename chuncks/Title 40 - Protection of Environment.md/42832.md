######### Unit utilizing common stack with nonaffected unit(s).

(b)When one or more affected units utilizes a common stack with one or more nonaffected units, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each affected unit and, for purposes of heat input determination,

(i) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each affected unit; or

(ii) For any affected unit using the common stack and eligible to use the procedures in appendix D to this part,

(A) Use the procedures in appendix D to determine heat input for that unit; however, for a common pipe configuration, the heat input apportionment provisions in section 2.1.2 of appendix D to this part shall not be used to meet the NOmass reporting provisions of this subpart unless all of the units served by the common pipe are affected units and have similar efficiencies; and

(B) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct to the common stack for each remaining affected unit that exhausts to the common stack; or

(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system in the common stack; and

(i) Designate the nonaffected units as affected units in accordance with the applicable State or federal NOmass emissions reduction program and meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

(ii) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the common stack and a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each nonaffected unit. The designated representative shall submit a petition to the permitting authority and the Administrator to allow a method of calculating and reporting the NOmass emissions from the affected units as the difference between NOmass emissions measured in the common stack and NOmass emissions measured in the ducts of the nonaffected units, not to be reported as an hourly value less than zero. The permitting authority and the Administrator may approve such a method whenever the designated representative demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the permitting authority and the Administrator, that the method ensures that the NOmass emissions from the affected units are not underestimated. In addition, the owner or operator shall also either:

(A) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct from each nonaffected unit or,

(B) For any nonaffected unit exhausting to the common stack and otherwise eligible to use the procedures in appendix D to this part, determine heat input rate using the procedures in appendix D for that unit. However, for a common pipe serving both affected and non-affected units, the heat input rate apportionment provisions in section 2.1.2 of appendix D to this part shall not be used to meet the NOmass reporting provisions of this subpart. For any remaining nonaffected unit that exhausts to the common stack, install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct to the common stack; or

(iii) Install a flow monitoring system in the common stack and record the combined emissions from all units as the combined NOmass emissions for the affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or

(iv) Submit a petition to the permitting authority and the Administrator to allow use of a method for apportioning NOmass emissions measured in the common stack to each of the units using the common stack and for reporting the NOmass emissions. The permitting authority and the Administrator may approve such a method whenever the designated representative demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the permitting authority and the Administrator, that the method ensures that the NOmass emissions from the affected units are not underestimated.
