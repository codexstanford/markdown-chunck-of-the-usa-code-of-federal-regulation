() For purposes of the calculated load and torque parameters in paragraph (k)(4)(ii)(B)() of this section, manufacturers must report the most accurate values that are calculated within the applicable electronic control unit (e.g., the engine control module). Most accurate, in this context, must be of sufficient accuracy, resolution, and filtering to be used for the purposes of in-use emission testing with the engine still in a vehicle (e.g., using portable emission measurement equipment).
