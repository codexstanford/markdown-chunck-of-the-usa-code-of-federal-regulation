(a) Choose an optimum nozzle that provides for isokinetic sampling conditions as close to 100 percent as possible. This is prudent because even if there are slight variations in the gas flow rate, gas temperature, or gas composition during the actual test, you have the maximum assurance of satisfying the isokinetic criteria. Generally, one of the two candidate nozzles selected will be closer to optimum (Section 8.5.4).

(b) When testing is for PMonly, you are allowed a 16 percent failure rate, rounded to the nearest whole number, of sampling points that are outside the range of the Δpand Δp. If the coarse fraction for PMdetermination is included, you are allowed only an eight percent failure rate of the sampling points, rounded to the nearest whole number, outside the Δpand Δp.
