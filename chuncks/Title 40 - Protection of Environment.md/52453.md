####### Calculation Method 3.

(3)Calculate CHand COemissions using Equation W-15 of this section:

(4) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil has a vapor recovery system.

(i) Adjust the emissions estimated in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section downward by the magnitude of emissions recovered using a vapor recovery system as determined by engineering estimate based on best available data.

(ii) [Reserved]

(5) Determine if the storage tank receiving your separator oil is sent to flare(s).

(i) Use your separator flash gas volume and gas composition as determined in this section.

(ii) Use the calculation method of flare stacks in paragraph (n) of this section to determine storage tank emissions from the flare.

(6) If you use Calculation Method 1 or Calculation Method 2 in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, calculate emissions from occurrences of gas-liquid separator liquid dump valves not closing during the calendar year by using Equation W-16 of this section.

(7) Calculate both CHand COmass emissions from natural gas volumetric emissions using calculations in paragraph (v) of this section.
