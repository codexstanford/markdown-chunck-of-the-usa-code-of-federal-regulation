####### Annual compliance certification.

(c)In the annual compliance certification report under paragraph (a) of this section, the designated representative shall certify, based on reasonable inquiry of those persons with primary responsibility for operating the opt-in source in compliance with the Acid Rain Program, whether the opt-in source was operated during the calendar year covered by the report in compliance with the requirements of the Acid Rain Program applicable to the opt-in source, including:

(1) Whether the opt-in source was operated in compliance with applicable Acid Rain emissions limitations, including whether the opt-in source held allowances, as of the allowance transfer deadline, in its compliance subaccount (after accounting for any allowance deductions or other adjustments under ยง 73.34(c) of this chapter) not less than the opt-in source's total sulfur dioxide emissions during the calendar year covered by the annual report;

(2) Whether the monitoring plan that governs the opt-in source has been maintained to reflect the actual operation and monitoring of the opt-in source and contains all information necessary to attribute monitored emissions to the opt-in source;

(3) Whether all the emissions from the opt-in source or group of affected units (including the opt-in source) using a common stack were monitored or accounted for through the missing data procedures and reported in the quarterly monitoring reports in accordance with part 75 of this chapter;

(4) Whether the facts that form the basis for certification of each monitor at the opt-in source or group of affected units (including the opt-in source) using a common stack or of an opt-in source's qualifications for using an Acid Rain Program excepted monitoring method or approved alternative monitoring method, if any, have changed;

(5) If a change is required to be reported under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, specify the nature of the change, the reason for the change, when the change occurred, and how the unit's compliance status was determined subsequent to the change, including what method was used to determine emissions when a change mandated the need for monitoring recertification; and

(6) When applicable, whether the opt-in source was operating in compliance with its thermal energy plan as provided in ยง 74.47 for combustion sources and ยง 74.48 for process sources.
