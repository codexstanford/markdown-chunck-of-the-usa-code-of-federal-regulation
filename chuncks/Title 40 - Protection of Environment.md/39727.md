###### Testing and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.11945 What performance testing requirements must I meet for process vents?
######## Continuous process vents.,i.e.,

(1)For continuous process vents, you must conduct all performance tests at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. For continuous compliance, you must conduct subsequent performance tests within the range of operating limit(s) that were established for the control device during the initial or subsequent performance tests specified in ยง 63.11925(d) and (e). If an operating limit is a range, then you must conduct subsequent performance tests within the range of maximum or minimum operating limits for the control device, which result in highest emissions (lowest emission reduction).
