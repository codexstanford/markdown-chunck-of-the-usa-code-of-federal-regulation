####### Calculations.

(3)The average VOHAP concentration (C) a mass-weighted basis shall be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the following equation. An owner or operator using a test method that provides species-specific chemical concentrations may adjust the measured concentrations to the corresponding concentration values which would be obtained had the off-site material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the off-site material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (f) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
