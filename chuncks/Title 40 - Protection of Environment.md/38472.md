####### i.e.,

7.1.7.3 An identification code for the formula used to derive the hourly PM emission rate from measurements of the PM concentration and other necessary parameters (Equation C-3 or C-4 in section 6.2.3 of this appendix or the applicable EPA test Method 19 equation);

7.1.7.4 If applicable, indicate that the diluent cap has been used to calculate the PM emission rate; and

7.1.7.5 If applicable, indicate that the default electrical load (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) has been used to calculate the hourly PM emission rate.

7.1.7.6 Indicate that the PM emission rate was not calculated for the hour, if valid data are not obtained for PM concentration and/or any of the other parameters in the PM emission rate equation. For the purposes of this appendix, substitute data values for stack gas flow rate, COconcentration, Oconcentration, and moisture content reported under part 75 of this chapter are not considered to be valid data. However, when the gross output (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042) is reported for an operating hour with zero output, the default electrical load value is treated as quality-assured data.

7.1.8 Other Parametric Data. If your PM CEMS measures PM concentrations at actual conditions, you must keep records of the temperatures and pressures used in Equation C-1 or C-2 to convert the measured hourly PM concentrations to standard conditions.

7.1.9 Certification, Recertification, and Quality Assurance Test Records. For any PM CEMS used to provide data under this subpart, you must record the following certification, recertification, and quality assurance information:

7.1.9.1 The test dates and times, reference values, monitor responses, monitor full scale value, and calculated results for the required 7-day drift tests and for the required daily zero and upscale calibration drift tests;

7.1.9.2 The test dates and times and results (pass or fail) of all daily system optics checks and daily sample volume checks of the PM CEMS (as applicable);

7.1.9.3 The test dates and times, reference values, monitor responses, and calculated results for all required quarterly ACAs;

7.1.9.4 The test dates and times, reference values, monitor responses, and calculated results for all required quarterly SVAs of extractive PM CEMS;
