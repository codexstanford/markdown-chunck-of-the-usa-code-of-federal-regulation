####### Closure cost estimate.

(f)(1) A commercial storer of PCB wastes shall have a detailed estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with its approved closure plan. The closure cost estimate shall be in writing, be certified by the person preparing it (using the certification defined in ยง 761.3) and comply with all of the following criteria:

(i) The closure cost estimate shall equal the cost of final closure at the point in the PCB storage facility's active life when the extent and manner of PCB storage operations would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by the facility's closure plan.

(ii) The closure cost estimate shall be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to close the facility, and the third party shall not be either a corporate parent or subsidiary of the owner or operator, or member in joint ownership of the facility.

(iii) The owner or operator shall include in the estimate the current market costs for off-site commercial disposal of the facility's maximum estimated inventory of PCB wastes, except that on-site disposal costs may be used if on-site disposal capacity will exist at the facility at all times over the life of the PCB storage facility.

(iv) The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of wastes, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of closure.
