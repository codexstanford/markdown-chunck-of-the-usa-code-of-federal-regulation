####### Determination of attainment for the eight-hour ozone standard.

(k)Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012 to 2014 show the Dukes County, Massachusetts eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by its July 20, 2015 attainment deadline. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Dukes County nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

(l) On February 9, 2018, Massachusetts submitted a certification that its air emissions reporting requirements applicable to stationary sources meet the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act. The certification was submitted as a SIP revision in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 2008 8-hour ozone standard.
