####### Redundant Backup Systems.

2.2.1A redundant backup monitoring system may be either a separate Hg CEMS with its own probe, sample interface, and analyzer, or a separate sorbent trap monitoring system. A redundant backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack location, and is kept on "hot standby" in case the primary monitoring system is unable to provide quality-assured data. A redundant backup system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Each redundant backup monitoring system must be certified according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this appendix and must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in section 5 of this appendix.
