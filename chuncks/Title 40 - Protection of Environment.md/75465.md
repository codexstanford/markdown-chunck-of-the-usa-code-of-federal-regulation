####### Surrogate pollutant

(o)means a regulated parameter that, for the purpose of compliance monitoring, is allowed to serve as a surrogate for a group of specific regulated parameters. Plants would be allowed to monitor for a surrogate pollutant(s), when the other parameters for which it stands are receiving the same degree of treatment as the surrogate pollutant(s) and all of the parameters discharged are in the same treatability class(es) as their respective surrogate pollutant(s). Treatability classes have been identified in appendix A of this part for both steam stripping and biological treatment technologies, which are the respective technology bases for PSES/PSNS and BAT/NSPS limitations controlling the discharge of regulated organic parameters.
