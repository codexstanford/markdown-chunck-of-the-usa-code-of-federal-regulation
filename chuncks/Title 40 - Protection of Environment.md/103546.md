######## Peak.

(3)Determine the percent opacity for the peaks in either acceleration or lugging mode by calculating the average of the 9 readings from paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section.

(g) Submit the following information in addition to what is required by ยง 1065.695:

(1) Exhaust pipe diameter(s).

(2) Measured maximum exhaust system backpressure over the entire test.

(3) Most recent date for establishing that each of the reference filters from paragraph (b) of this section are NIST-traceable.

(4) Measured smokemeter zero and linearity values after testing.

(5) 10 Hz data from all valid test runs.

(h) The following figure illustrates the dynamometer controls and engine speeds for exhaust opacity testing:
