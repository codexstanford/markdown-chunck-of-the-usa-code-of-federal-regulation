###### Travel time.

3.1.2.4Evaluate the travel time factor based on the geologic materials in the interval between the lowest known point of hazardous substances at the site and the top of the aquifer being evaluated. Assign a value to the travel time factor as follows:

- If the depth to aquifer (see section 3.1.2.3) is 10 feet or less, assign a value of 35.

- If, for the interval being evaluated, all layers that underlie a portion of the sources at the site are karst, assign a value of 35.

- Otherwise:

Determine travel time only at locations within 2 miles of the sources at the site, except: if observed ground water contamination attributable to sources at the site extends more than 2 miles beyond these sources, use any location within the limits of this observed ground water contamination when evaluating the travel time factor for any aquifer that does not have an observed release. If the necessary subsurface geologic information is available at multiple locations, evaluate the travel time factor at each location. Use the location having the highest travel time factor value to assign the factor value for the aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
