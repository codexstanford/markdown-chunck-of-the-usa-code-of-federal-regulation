###### Principle.

4.1The calibration procedure is based on the photometric assay of Oconcentrations in a dynamic flow system. The concentration of Oin an absorption cell is determined from a measurement of the amount of 254 nm light absorbed by the sample. This determination requires knowledge of (1) the absorption coefficient (&#x3B1;) of Oat 254 nm, (2) the optical path length (l) through the sample, (3) the transmittance of the sample at a nominal wavelength of 254 nm, and (4) the temperature (T) and pressure (P) of the sample. The transmittance is defined as the ratio I/Iwhere I is the intensity of light which passes through the cell and is sensed by the detector when the cell contains an Osample, and Iis the intensity of light which passes through the cell and is sensed by the detector when the cell contains zero air. It is assumed that all conditions of the system, except for the contents of the absorption cell, are identical during measurement of I and I. The quantities defined above are related by the Beer-Lambert absorption law,

A stable Ogenerator is used to produce Oconcentrations over the required calibration concentration range. Each Oconcentration is determined from the measurement of the transmittance (I/I) of the sample at 254 nm with a photometer of path length l and calculated from the equation,

The calculated Oconcentrations must be corrected for Olosses, which may occur in the photometer, and for the temperature and pressure of the sample.
