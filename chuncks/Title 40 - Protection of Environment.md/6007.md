####### First-chance test.

(c)The test timer shall start (tt = 0) when the conditions specified in paragraph (V)(b)(2) of this appendix are met. The test shall have an overall maximum test time of 155 seconds (tt = 155). The first-chance test shall consist of an idle mode only.

(1) The mode timer shall start (mt = 0) when the vehicle engine speed is between 350 and 1100 rpm. If the engine speed exceeds 1100 rpm or falls below 350 rpm, the mode timer shall reset to zero and resume timing. The minimum mode length shall be determined as described in paragraph (V)(c)(2) of this appendix. The maximum mode length shall be 90 seconds elapsed time (mt = 90).

(2) The pass/fail analysis shall begin after an elapsed time of 10 seconds (mt = 10). A pass or fail determination shall be made for the vehicle and the mode shall be terminated as follows:

(i) The vehicle shall pass the idle mode and the test shall be immediately terminated if, prior to an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt = 30), measured values are less than or equal to 100 ppm HC and 0.5 percent CO.

(ii) The vehicle shall pass the idle mode and the test shall be terminated at the end of an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt = 30) if, prior to that time, the criteria of paragraph (V)(c)(2)(i) of this appendix are not satisfied, and the measured values are less than or equal to the applicable short test standards as described in paragraph (V)(a)(2) of this appendix.

(iii) The vehicle shall pass the idle mode and the test shall be immediately terminated if, at any point between an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt = 30) and 90 seconds (mt = 90), the measured values are less than or equal to the applicable short test standards as described in paragraph (V)(a)(2) of this appendix.

(iv) The vehicle shall fail the idle mode and the test shall be terminated if none of the provisions of paragraphs (V)(c)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this appendix is satisfied by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt = 90). Alternatively, the vehicle may be failed if the provisions of paragraphs (V)(c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this appendix are not met within an elapsed time of 30 seconds.
