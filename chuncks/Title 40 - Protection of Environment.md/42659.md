###### § 75.34 Units with add-on emission controls.
####### i.e.

(5) For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data availability for SOor NO, calculated in accordance with § 75.32, is below 80.0 percent and parametric data establish that the add-on emission controls were operating properly (within the range of operating parameters provided in the quality assurance/quality control program),in lieu of reporting the maximum potential value, the owner or operator may substitute, as applicable, the greater of:

(i) The maximum expected SOconcentration or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled SOconcentration recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours;

(ii) The maximum expected NOconcentration or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled NOconcentration recorded in the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin;

(iii) The maximum controlled hourly NOemission rate (MCR) or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled NOemission rate recorded in the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin;

(iv) For the purposes of implementing the missing data options in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, the maximum expected SOand NOconcentrations shall be determined, respectively, according to sections 2.1.1.2 and 2.1.2.2 of appendix A to this part. The MCR shall be calculated according to the basic procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part, except that the words "maximum potential NOemission rate (MER)" shall be replaced with the words "maximum controlled NOemission rate (MCR)" and the NOMEC shall be used instead of the NOMPC.

(b) For an affected unit equipped with add-on SOemission controls, the designated representative may petition the Administrator to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described in appendix C of this part, for calculating substitute SOconcentration data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall use the procedures in §§ 75.31, 75.33, or 75.34(a) for providing substitute data for missing SOconcentration data unless a parametric monitoring procedure has been approved by the Administrator.

(1) Where the monitor data availability is 90.0 percent or more for an outlet SOpollutant concentration monitor, the owner or operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric monitoring procedure.

(2) Where the monitor data availability for an outlet SOpollutant concentration monitor is less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data using the procedures in § 75.34(a) (1) or (2), even if the Administrator has approved a parametric monitoring procedure.

(c) For an affected unit with NOadd-on emission controls, the designated representative may petition the Administrator to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described in appendix C of this part, in order to calculate substitute NOemission rate data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall use the procedures in § 75.31 or 75.33 for providing substitute data for missing NOemission rate data prior to receiving the Administrator's approval for a parametric monitoring procedure.

(1) Where monitor data availability for a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system is 90.0 percent or more, the owner or operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric monitoring procedure.

(2) Where monitor data availability for a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system is less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data using the procedure in § 75.34(a) (1) or (2), even if the Administrator has approved a parametric monitoring procedure.

(d) In order to implement the options in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section; and §§ 75.31(c)(3) and 75.72(c)(3), the owner or operator shall keep records of information as described in § 75.58(b)(3) to verify the proper operation of all add-on SOor NOemission controls, during all periods of SOor NOemission missing data. If the owner or operator elects to implement the missing data option in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the records in § 75.58(b)(3) are required to be kept only for the ozone season. The owner or operator shall document in the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program required by section 1 of appendix B to this part, the parameters monitored and (as applicable) the ranges and combinations of parameters that indicate proper operation of the controls. The owner or operator shall provide the information recorded under § 75.58(b)(3) and the related QA/QC program information to the Administrator, to the EPA Regional Office, or to the appropriate State or local agency, upon request.
