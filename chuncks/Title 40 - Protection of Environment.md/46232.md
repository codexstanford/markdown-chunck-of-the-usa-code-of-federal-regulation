####### Monitoring conditions for input components.

(iv)(A) The OBD system must monitor input components continuously for out-of-range values and circuit continuity. The manufacturer may disable continuous monitoring for circuit continuity and out-of-range values when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that a properly functioning input component cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning input component and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false malfunction detection.

(B) For input component rationality checks (where applicable), the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that rationality checks must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
