###### ยง 98.127 Records that must be retained.
####### Mass balance method.

(c)Retain the following records for each process for which the mass balance method was used to estimate emissions in reporting years 2011, 2012, 2013, or 2014. If you used an element other than fluorine in the mass balance equation pursuant to the former ยง 98.123(b)(3) as included in paragraph 1 of Appendix A of this subpart for the former mass balance method, substitute that element for fluorine in the recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph.

(1) The data and calculations used to estimate the absolute and relative errors associated with use of the mass-balance approach.

(2) The data and calculations used to estimate the mass of fluorine emitted from the process.

(3) The data and calculations used to determine the fractions of the mass emitted consisting of each reactant (FER), product (FEP), and by-product (FEB), including the preliminary calculations in the former ยง 98.123(b)(8)(i).
