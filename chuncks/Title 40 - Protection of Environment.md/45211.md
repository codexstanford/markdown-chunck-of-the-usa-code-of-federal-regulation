###### Appendix B3 to Subpart F of Part 82 - Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling, and/or Reclaim Equipment
####### Performance Rating of Refrigerant Recovery Equipment and Recovery/Recycling Equipment.

This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute Standard 740-2016,

1.1 The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of testing for rating and evaluating the performance of refrigerant recovery, and/or recycling equipment and general equipment requirements (herein referred to as "equipment") for contaminant or purity levels, capacity, speed and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere of designated refrigerants.

2.1 This standard applies to equipment for recovering and/or recycling single refrigerants, azeotropes, zeotropic blends, and their normal contaminants from refrigerant systems. This standard defines the test apparatus, test gas mixtures, sampling procedures and analytical techniques that will be used to determine the performance of refrigerant recovery and/or recycling equipment (hereinafter, "equipment"). Appendix B4 of this subpart establishes standards for recovery/recycling equipment used with flammable refrigerants.
