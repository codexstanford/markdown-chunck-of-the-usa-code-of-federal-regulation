(3) Conduct a performance evaluation of the bag leak detection system in accordance with your monitoring plan and consistent with the guidance provided in EPA-454/R-98-015 (incorporated by reference,§ 60.17);

(4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor; and

(5) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will sound an alarm when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed readily by plant operating personnel.

(s) For facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit, compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit may be demonstrated by using the CEMS specified in § 60.2730(l) to measure sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in paragraph (s) of this section. For sources that have actual inlet emissions less than 100 parts per million dry volume, the relative accuracy criterion for inlet sulfur dioxide CEMS should be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the reference method test data in terms of the units of the emission standard, or 5 parts per million dry volume absolute value of the mean difference between the reference method and the CEMS, whichever is greater:

(1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by performance specification 2 in appendix B of this part, collect sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (s)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(i) For sulfur dioxide, EPA Reference Method 6 or 6C, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) must be used; and

(ii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide), EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used.

(2) The span value of the CEMS at the inlet to the sulfur dioxide control device must be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential sulfur dioxide emissions of the unit subject to this subpart. The span value of the CEMS at the outlet of the sulfur dioxide control device must be 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential sulfur dioxide emissions of the unit subject to this subpart.

(3) Conduct accuracy determinations quarterly and calibration drift tests daily in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.

(t) For facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit, compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit may be demonstrated by using the CEMS specified in § 60.2730 to measure nitrogen oxides. The nitrogen oxides CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(1) through (4) of this section:

(1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, collect nitrogen oxides and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (t)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(i) For nitrogen oxides, EPA Reference Method 7 or 7E at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4 must be used; and

(ii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide), EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used.

(2) The span value of the CEMS must be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential nitrogen oxide emissions of unit.

(3) Conduct accuracy determinations quarterly and calibration drift tests daily in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.

(4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be reestablished during performance compliance tests:

(i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A, 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor;

(ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour;

(iii) Each sample must represent a 1-hour average; and

(iv) A minimum of 3 runs must be performed.

(u) For facilities using a CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for mercury to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with any of the emission limits of this subpart, you must complete the following:

(1) Demonstrate compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) using a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at appendix A-7 of this part. The 1-hour arithmetic averages for CEMS must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2). Except for CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, the 1-hour arithmetic averages used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations must be corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). Integrated sorbent trap monitoring system or CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content; and

(2) Operate all CEMS and integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part.

(v) Use of the bypass stack at any time is an emissions standards deviation for PM, HCl, lead, cadmium, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dioxin/furans.

(w) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain an oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 60.2875 according to the procedures in paragraphs (w)(1) through (4) of this section:

(1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2675;

(2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (w)(3) of this section at all times;

(3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and

(4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.
