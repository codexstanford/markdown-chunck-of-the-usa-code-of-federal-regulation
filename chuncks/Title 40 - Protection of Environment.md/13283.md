(g)-The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) submitted to the EPA a request on December 4, 2000, to revise the Louisiana SIP for Beauregard, St. Mary, Lafayette, and Grant Parishes and the New Orleans Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area ozone maintenance area. The revision involves changes to the approved contingency plans. The contingency measures and the schedule for implementation satisfy the requirements of section 175A(d) of the Act. The EPA therefore approved this request on June 20, 2003.
