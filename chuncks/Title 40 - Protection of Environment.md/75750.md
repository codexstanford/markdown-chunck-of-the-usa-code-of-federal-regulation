(a)The permittee must:

(1) Employ efficient feed management and feeding strategies that limit feed input to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to achieve production goals and sustain targeted rates of aquatic animal growth in order to minimize potential discharges of uneaten feed and waste products to waters of the U.S.

(2) In order to minimize the discharge of accumulated solids from settling ponds and basins and production systems, identify and implement procedures for routine cleaning of rearing units and off-line settling basins, and procedures to minimize any discharge of accumulated solids during the inventorying, grading and harvesting aquatic animals in the production system.

(3) Remove and dispose of aquatic animal mortalities properly on a regular basis to prevent discharge to waters of the U.S., except in cases where the permitting authority authorizes such discharge in order to benefit the aquatic environment.
