####### GHG-only source

(xii)means any existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs in the amount equal to or greater than the amount of GHGs on a mass basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the amount of GHGs on a COe basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(49) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued, but does not emit or have the potential to emit any other non-GHG regulated NSR pollutant at or above the applicable major source threshold. A GHG-only source may only obtain a PAL for GHG emissions under paragraph (aa) of this section.
