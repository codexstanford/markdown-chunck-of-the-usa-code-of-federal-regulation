###### § 600.510-12 Calculation of average fuel economy and average carbon-related exhaust emissions.
####### Fuel consumption improvement.

(3)Calculate the separate air conditioning, off-cycle, and pickup truck fuel consumption improvement as follows:

(i) Air conditioning fuel consumption improvement values are calculated separately for each category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the following equation:

(ii) Off-cycle technology fuel consumption improvement values are calculated separately for each category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the following equation:

(iii) Full size pickup truck fuel consumption improvement values are calculated for the light truck category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the following equation:

(d) The Administrator may approve alternative calculation methods if they are part of an approved credit plan under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 2003.

(e) For passenger automobile categories identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the average fuel economy calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall be adjusted using the following equation:

(f) The Administrator shall calculate and apply additional average fuel economy adjustments if, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Administrator determines that, as a result of test procedure changes not previously considered, such correction is necessary to yield fuel economy test results that are comparable to those obtained under the 1975 test procedures. In making such determinations, the Administrator must find that:

(1) A directional change in measured fuel economy of an average vehicle can be predicted from a revision to the test procedures;

(2) The magnitude of the change in measured fuel economy for any vehicle or fleet of vehicles caused by a revision to the test procedures is quantifiable from theoretical calculations or best available test data;

(3) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not due to eliminating the ability of manufacturers to take advantage of flexibility within the existing test procedures to gain measured improvements in fuel economy which are not the result of actual improvements in the fuel economy of production vehicles;

(4) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not solely due to a greater ability of manufacturers to reflect in average fuel economy those design changes expected to have comparable effects on in-use fuel economy;

(5) The test procedure change is required by EPA or is a change initiated by EPA in its laboratory and is not a change implemented solely by a manufacturer in its own laboratory.

(g)(1) Dual fuel automobiles must provide equal or greater energy efficiency while operating on the alternative fuel as while operating on gasoline or diesel fuel to obtain the CAFE credit determined in paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section or to obtain the carbon-related exhaust emissions credit determined in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The following equation must hold true:

(i) The equation must hold true for both the FTP city and HFET highway fuel economy values for each test of each test vehicle.

(ii)(A) The net heating value for alcohol fuels shall be premeasured using a test method which has been approved in advance by the Administrator.

(B) The density for alcohol fuels shall be premeasured using ASTM D 1298 (incorporated by reference at § 600.011).

(iii) The net heating value and density of gasoline are to be determined by the manufacturer in accordance with § 600.113.

(2) [Reserved]

(3) Dual fuel passenger automobiles manufactured during model years 1993 through 2019 must meet the minimum driving range requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR part 538) to obtain the CAFE credit determined in paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section.

(h) The increase in average fuel economy determined in paragraph (c) of this section attributable to dual fueled automobiles is subject to a maximum value through model year 2019 that applies separately to each category of automobile specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The increase in average fuel economy attributable to vehicles fueled by electricity or, for model years 2016 and later, by compressed natural gas, is not subject to a maximum value. The increase in average fuel economy attributable to alcohol dual fuel model types calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section is also not subject to a maximum value. The following maximum values apply under this paragraph (h):

(1) The Administrator shall calculate the increase in average fuel economy to determine if the maximum increase provided in this paragraph (h) has been reached. The Administrator shall calculate the increase in average fuel economy for each category of automobiles specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by subtracting the average fuel economy values calculated in accordance with this section, assuming all alcohol dual fueled automobiles subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are operated exclusively on gasoline (or diesel fuel), from the average fuel economy values determined in paragraph (c) of this section. The difference is limited to the maximum increase specified in this paragraph (h).

(2) [Reserved]

(i) For model years 2012 through 2015, and for each category of automobile identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the maximum decrease in average carbon-related exhaust emissions determined in paragraph (j) of this section attributable to alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles shall be calculated using the following formula, and rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile:

(1) The Administrator shall calculate the decrease in average carbon-related exhaust emissions to determine if the maximum decrease provided in this paragraph (i) has been reached. The Administrator shall calculate the average carbon-related exhaust emissions for each category of automobiles specified in paragraph (a) of this section by subtracting the average carbon-related exhaust emission values determined in paragraph (j) of this section from the average carbon-related exhaust emission values calculated in accordance with this section by assuming all alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles are operated exclusively on gasoline (or diesel) fuel. For the purposes of these calculations, the values for natural gas dual fuel automobiles using the optional Utility Factor approach in paragraph (j)(2)(vii) of this section shall not be the gasoline CREE values, but the CREE values determined in paragraph (j)(2)(vii) of this section. The difference is limited to the maximum decrease specified in paragraph (i) of this section.

(2) [Reserved]

(j) The average carbon-related exhaust emissions will be calculated individually for each category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section as follows:

(1) Divide the total production volume of that category of automobiles into:

(2) A sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a model type within that category of automobiles and is a product determined by multiplying the number of automobiles of that model type produced by the manufacturer in the model year by:

(i) For gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled model types, the carbon-related exhaust emissions value calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

(ii)(A) For alcohol-fueled model types, for model years 2012 through 2015, the carbon-related exhaust emissions value calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section multiplied by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest gram per mile, except that manufacturers complying with the fleet averaging option for NO and CHas allowed under § 86.1818 of this chapter must perform this calculation such that NO and CHvalues are not multiplied by 0.15; or
