####### Monitoring a different parameter than those listed.

(e)The owner or operator who has been directed by § 65.154(c)(2) or § 65.155(c)(1) to set monitoring parameters, or who requests as allowed by § 65.156(e) approval to monitor a different parameter than those listed in § 65.148(c), § 65.149(c), § 65.150(c), § 65.151(c), § 65.152(c), § 65.153(c), § 65.154(c), § 65.160, or paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, shall submit the following information with the operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority:

(1) A description of the parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the process, control technology, or pollution prevention measure is operated in conformance with its design and achieves the specified emission limit, percent reduction, or nominal efficiency, and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).

(2) A description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation of the control device, the schedule for this demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish a range for the monitored parameter as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report required in § 65.5(d) unless this information has already been included in the operating permit application or previously established under a referencing subpart.

(3) The frequency and content of monitoring, recording, and reporting if monitoring and recording is not continuous, or if reports of daily average values when the monitored parameter value is outside the range established in the operating permit or Initial Compliance Status Report will not be included in Periodic Reports as specified in § 65.166(e). The rationale for the proposed monitoring, recording, and reporting system shall be included.
