######## Scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln: alternative limits.

(e)The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/ delacquering kiln/decoating kiln may choose to comply with the emission limits in this paragraph (e) as an alternative to the limits in paragraph (d) of this section if the scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln is equipped with an afterburner having a design residence time of at least 1 second and the afterburner is operated at a temperature of at least 760 &#xB0;C (1400 &#xB0;F) at all times. On and after the compliance date established by § 63.1501:

(1) The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere emissions in excess of:

(i) 0.10 kg of THC, as propane, per Mg (0.20 lb of THC, as propane, per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(ii) 0.15 kg of PM per Mg (0.30 lb per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(iii) 5.0 µg of D/F TEQ per Mg (7.0 x 10gr of D/F TEQ per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major or area source; and

(iv) 0.75 kg of HCl per Mg (1.50 lb per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source.

(2) The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/ delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere visible emissions in excess of 10 percent opacity from any PM add-on air pollution control device if a COM is chosen as the monitoring option.
