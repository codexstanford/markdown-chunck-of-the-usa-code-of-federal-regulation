###### Line 06-Pollution Controls Capital Investment.,General

Enter the estimated pollution control capital outlays projected to be made under the two alternative sets of assumptions described in thesection of this schedule. These controls shall include only interim control equipment for the first set of assumptions and both interim control equipment and any additional SOcontrols required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, for the second set of assumptions. The values assumed in this schedule shall correspond to the investment estimates shown in each set of supporting schedules for Line 17 of Schedule D.3. For purposes of allocating costs of the additional SOcontrols under the second set of assumptions, applicants must provide information establishing the period over which capital outlays for such controls would be made if installation of the controls begins the latest date that would still allow compliance to be achieved by January 2, 1988. Changes in working capital investment due to investment in control facilities may be added to the capital investment estimates shown in the corresponding supporting schedules for Schedule D.3.
