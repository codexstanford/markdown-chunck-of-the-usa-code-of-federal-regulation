####### e.g.,

(3) An up-to-date analysis and the supporting information and data used to determine whether or not equipment is subject to the requirements in §§ 261.1052 through 261.1060. The record shall include supporting documentation as required by § 261.1063(d)(3) when application of the knowledge of the nature of the hazardous secondary material stream or the process by which it was produced is used. If the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material takes any action (changing the process that produced the material) that could result in an increase in the total organic content of the material contained in or contacted by equipment determined not to be subject to the requirements in §§ 261.1052 through 261.1060, then a new determination is required.

(l) Records of the equipment leak information required by paragraph (d) of this section and the operating information required by paragraph (e) of this section need be kept only three years.

(m) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material at a facility with equipment that is subject to this subpart and to regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 may elect to determine compliance with this subpart either by documentation pursuant to § 261.1064 of this subpart, or by documentation of compliance with the regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 pursuant to the relevant provisions of the regulations at 40 part 60, part 61, or part 63. The documentation of compliance under regulations at 40 CFR part 60, part 61, or part 63 shall be kept with or made readily available at the facility.
