###### Determine the Fractional Calibration Uncertainty.

4.11Calculate the fractional calibration uncertainty for each analyte (FCUi) according to appendix F of this addendum, and compare these values to the fractional uncertainty limits (AU; see section 4.1.2 of this addendum). If FCU>AU, either the reference spectra or analytical programs for that analyte are unsuitable.
