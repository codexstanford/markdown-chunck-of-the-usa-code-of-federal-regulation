######## Unit with multiple stacks or ducts.

(d)When the flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into two or more stacks (that may include flue gases from other affected or nonaffected units), or when the flue gases utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than the stack, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in each duct feeding into the stack or stacks and determine SOmass emissions from each affected unit as the sum of the SOmass emissions recorded for each duct; or

(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in each stack. Determine SOmass emissions from each affected unit as the sum of the SOmass emissions recorded for each stack. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if another unit also exhausts flue gases to one or more of the stacks, the owner or operator shall also comply with the applicable common stack requirements of this section to determine and record SOmass emissions from the units using that stack and shall calculate and report SOmass emissions from the affected units and stacks, pursuant to an approach approved by the Administrator, such that these emissions are not underestimated.
