####### Vapor collection system of the terminal.

(f)Each owner or operator of an affected source shall submit with the initial performance test and maintain in an accessible location on site an engineering report describing in detail the vent system, or vapor collection system, used to vent each vent stream to a control device. This report shall include all valves and vent pipes that could vent the stream to the atmosphere, thereby bypassing the control device, and identify which valves are car-sealed opened and which valves are car-sealed closed.

(g) If a vent system, or vapor collection system, containing valves that could divert the emission stream away from the control device is used, each owner or operator of an affected source shall keep for at least 5 years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:

(1) All periods when flow bypassing the control device is indicated if flow indicators are installed under § 63.563(a)(1) and § 63.564(b), and

(2) All times when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car-seal is broken, and when the valve position is changed (i.e., from open to closed for valves in the vent piping to the control device and from closed to open for valves that vent the stream directly or indirectly to the atmosphere bypassing the control device) if valves are monitored under § 63.564(b).

(h) The owner or operator of an affected source shall keep the vapor-tightness documentation required under § 63.563(a)(4) on file at the source in a permanent form available for inspection.
