####### Mass of NMNEHC.

(6)Determine the mass of NMNEHC using one of the following methods:

(i) If the test fuel has less than 0.010 mol/mol of ethane and you omit the NMNEHC calculations as described in ยง 1065.660(c)(1), take the corrected mass of NMNEHC to be 0.95 times the corrected mass of NMHC.

(ii) If the test fuel has at least 0.010 mol/mol of ethane and you omit the NMNEHC calculations as described in ยง 1065.660(c)(1), take the corrected mass of NMNEHC to be 1.0 times the corrected mass of NMHC.
