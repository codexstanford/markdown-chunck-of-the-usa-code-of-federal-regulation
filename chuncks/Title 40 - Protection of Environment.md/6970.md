b. Many models use the standard hourly weather observations available from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).These observations are then preprocessed before they can be used in the models. Prior to the advent of ASOS in the early 1990's, the standard "hourly" weather observation was a human-based observation reflecting a single 2-minute average generally taken about 10 minutes before the hour. However, beginning in January 2000 for first-order stations and in March 2005 for all stations, the NCEI has archived the 1-minute ASOS wind data (the rolling 2-minute average winds) for the NWS ASOS sites. The AERMINUTE processorwas developed to reduce the number of calm and missing hours in AERMET processing by substituting standard hourly observations with full hourly average winds calculated from 1-minute ASOS wind data.
