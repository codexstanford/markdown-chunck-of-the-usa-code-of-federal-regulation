1.1 This method provides for the measurement of the mass concentration of fine particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM) in ambient air over a 24-hour period for purposes of determining whether the primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter specified in ยง 50.7 and ยง 50.13 of this part are met. The measurement process is considered to be nondestructive, and the PMsample obtained can be subjected to subsequent physical or chemical analyses. Quality assessment procedures are provided in part 58, appendix A of this chapter, and quality assurance guidance are provided in references 1, 2, and 3 in section 13.0 of this appendix.

1.2 This method will be considered a reference method for purposes of part 58 of this chapter only if:

(a) The associated sampler meets the requirements specified in this appendix and the applicable requirements in part 53 of this chapter, and

(b) The method and associated sampler have been designated as a reference method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.

1.3 PMsamplers that meet nearly all specifications set forth in this method but have minor deviations and/or modifications of the reference method sampler will be designated as "Class I" equivalent methods for PMin accordance with part 53 of this chapter.
