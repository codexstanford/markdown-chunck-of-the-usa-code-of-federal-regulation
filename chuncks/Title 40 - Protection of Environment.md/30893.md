####### Parameters for control devices controlling batch process vents.

(iii)For devices controlling batch process vents alone or in combination with other streams, the parameter level(s) shall be established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.

(A) If more than one batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single level for the batch process(es) shall be determined from the initial compliance demonstration.

(B) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch process(es), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, selected to be controlled. If separate monitoring levels are established, the owner or operator must provide a record indicating at what point in the daily schedule or log of processes required to be recorded per the requirements of ยง 63.1259(b)(9) the parameter being monitored changes levels and must record at least one reading of the new parameter level, even if the duration of monitoring for the new parameter is less than 15-minutes.
