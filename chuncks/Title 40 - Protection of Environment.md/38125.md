###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.10005 What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date must I conduct them?
######## i.e.

(ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section (with some modifications), are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds times the number of units sharing the common stack. Base your calculations on the combined heat input capacity of all units sharing the stack (, either the combined maximum rated value or, if applicable, a lower combined value restricted by permit conditions or operating hours).

(5) For an affected unit with a multiple stack or duct configuration in which the exhaust stacks or ducts are downstream of all emission control devices, you must perform a separate emission test in each stack or duct. The unit qualifies for LEE status if:

(i) The emission rate, based on all test runs performed at all of the stacks or ducts, is less than 50 percent (10 percent for Hg) of the applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart; or

(ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds. Use the average Hg emission rate from paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section in your calculations.
