###### ยง 98.466 Data reporting requirements.
####### e.g.,

(5) An indication of whether leachate recirculation is used during the reporting year and its typical frequency of use over the past 10 years (used several times a year for the past 10 years, used at least once a year for the past 10 years, used occasionally but not every year over the past 10 years, not used).

(b) Report the following waste characterization and modeling information:

(1) The number of waste steams (including "Other Industrial Solid Waste (not otherwise listed)" and "Inerts") for which Equation TT-1 of this subpart is used to calculate modeled CHgeneration.

(2) A description of each waste stream (including the types of materials in each waste stream) for which Equation TT-1 of this subpart is used to calculate modeled CHgeneration.

(3) The fraction of CHin the landfill gas, F, (volume fraction, dry basis, corrected to 0% oxygen) for the reporting year and an indication as to whether this was the default value or a value determined through measurement data.

(4) The methane correction factor (MCF) value used in the calculations. If an MCF value other than the default of 1 is used, provide a description of the aeration system, including aeration blower capacity, the fraction of the landfill containing waste affected by the aeration, the total number of hours during the year the aeration blower was operated, and other factors used as a basis for the selected MCF value.

(5) For each waste stream, the decay rate (k) value used in the calculations.

(c) Report the following historical waste information:

(1) [Reserved]

(2) For each waste stream identified in paragraph (b) of this section, the method(s) for estimating historical waste disposal quantities and the range of years for which each method applies.

(3) For each waste stream identified in paragraph (b) of this section for which Equation TT-2 of this subpart is used, provide:

(i) [Reserved]

(ii) The year of the data used in Equation TT-2 of ยง 98.463 for the waste disposal quantity and production quantity, for each year used in Equation TT-2 to calculate the average waste disposal factor (WDF).

(iii) [Reserved]

(4) If Equation TT-4a of this subpart is used, provide:

(i) The value of landfill capacity (LFC).

(ii) YrData.

(iii) YrOpen.

(5) If Equation TT-4b of this subpart is used, provide:

(i) WIP (i.e., the quantity of waste in-place at the start of the reporting year from design drawings or engineering estimates (metric tons) or, for closed landfills for which waste in-place quantities are not available, the landfill's design capacity).

(ii) The cumulative quantity of waste placed in the landfill for the years for which disposal quantities are available from company record or from Equation TT-3 of this part.

(iii) YrLast.

(iv) YrOpen.

(v) NYrData.

(d) For each year of landfilling starting with the "Start Year" (S) and each year thereafter up to the current reporting year, report the following information:

(1) The calendar year for which the following data elements apply.

(2) The quantity of waste (W) disposed of in the landfill (metric tons, wet weight) for the specified year for each waste stream identified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(3) For each waste stream, the degradable organic carbon (DOC) value (mass fraction) for the specified year and an indication as to whether this was the default value from Table TT-1 to this subpart, a measured value using a 60-day anaerobic biodegradation test as specified in ยง 98.464(b)(4)(i), or a value based on total and volatile solids measurements as specified in ยง 98.464(b)(4)(ii). If DOCwas determined by a 60-day anaerobic biodegradation test, specify the test method used.

(e) Report the following information describing the landfill cover material:

(1) The type of cover material used (as either organic cover, clay cover, sand cover, or other soil mixtures).

(2) For each type of cover material used, the surface area (in square meters) at the start of the reporting year for the landfill sections that contain waste and that are associated with the selected cover type.

(f) The modeled annual methane generation (G) for the reporting year (metric tons CH) calculated using Equation TT-1 of this subpart.

(g) For landfills without gas collection systems, provide:
