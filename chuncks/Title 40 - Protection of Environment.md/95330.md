() The rate constants (k)and (k)are calculated from equations 2 and 3 but the time of irradiation must be adjusted to reflect the fact that day-averaged rate constants are approximately one-third of rate constants averaged over only 8 daylight hours. For 1 hour of insolation enter t = 0.125 day into equation 2. For reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours enter 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 days, respectively. Proceed to Phase 3 testing.
