It is anticipated that EPA, TACB, the City of El Paso, and SEDUE will continue a cooperative effort to study the PM-10 air quality in the El Paso/Juarez air basin. Based on the availability of enhanced emissions and monitoring data, as well as more sophisticated modeling techniques (e.g., Urban Airshed Model), future studies will attempt to better define the relative contributions of El Paso and Juarez to the PM-10 problem in the basin. At that time, a contingency plan can more appropriately be developed in a cooperative effort with Mexico."
