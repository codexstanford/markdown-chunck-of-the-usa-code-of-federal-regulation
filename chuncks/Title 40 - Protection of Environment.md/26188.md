###### § 63.343 Compliance provisions.
####### Packed-bed scrubber systems.

(2)(i) During the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, complying with the emission limitations in § 63.342 through the use of a packed-bed scrubber system shall determine the outlet chromium concentration using the procedures in § 63.344(c), and shall establish as site-specific operating parameters the pressure drop across the system and the velocity pressure at the common inlet of the control device, setting the value that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation using the procedures in § 63.344(d) (4) and (5). An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant operating parameter values. Alternatively, the owner or operator may set as the compliant value the average pressure drop and inlet velocity pressure measured over the three test runs of one performance test, and accept +/-1 inch of water column from the pressure drop value and +/-10 percent from the velocity pressure value as the compliant range.

(ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, shall monitor and record the velocity pressure at the inlet to the packed-bed system and the pressure drop across the scrubber system once each day that any affected source is operating. To be in compliance with the standards, the scrubber system shall be operated within +/-10 percent of the velocity pressure value established during the initial performance test, and within +/-1 inch of water column of the pressure drop value established during the initial performance test, or within the range of compliant operating parameter values established during multiple performance tests.
