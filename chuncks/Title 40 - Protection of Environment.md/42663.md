###### § 75.36 Missing data procedures for heat input rate determinations.
####### i.e.,

(b) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification at a particular unit or stack location (the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by a CEMS at that location), or (when implementing these procedures for a previously certified COor Omonitor) during the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours preceding implementation of the standard missing data procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall provide substitute COor Odata, as applicable, for the calculation of heat input (under section 5.2 of appendix F to this part) according to § 75.31(b).

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Upon completion of 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours using the initial missing data procedures of § 75.31(b), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for COor Oconcentration to calculate heat input rate, as follows. Substitute COdata for heat input rate determinations shall be provided according to § 75.35(d). Substitute Odata for the heat input rate determinations shall be provided in accordance with the procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term "Oconcentration" shall apply rather than the term "SOconcentration" and the term "Odiluent monitor" shall apply rather than the term "SOpollutant concentration monitor." In addition, the term "substitute the lesser of" shall apply rather than "substitute the greater of;" the terms "minimum hourly Oconcentration" and "minimum potential Oconcentration, as determined under section 2.1.3.2 of appendix A to this part" shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms "maximum hourly SOconcentration" and "maximum potential SOconcentration, as determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part;" and the terms "10th percentile" and "5th percentile" shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms "90th percentile" and "95th percentile" (see Table 1 of § 75.33).
