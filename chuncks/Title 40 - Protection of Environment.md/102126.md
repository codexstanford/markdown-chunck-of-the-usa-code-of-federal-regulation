## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter U - Air Pollution Controls
#### PART 1054 - CONTROL OF EMISSIONS FROM NEW, SMALL NONROAD SPARK-IGNITION ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart B - Emission Standards and Related Requirements
###### ยง 1054.145 Are there interim provisions that apply only for a limited time?
####### Continued use of 40 CFR part 90 test data.

(j)You may continue to use data based on the test procedures that apply for engines built before the requirements of this part start to apply if we allow you to use carryover emission data under ยง 1054.235(d) for your emission family. You may also use those test procedures for measuring exhaust emissions for production-line testing with any engine family whose certification is based on testing with those procedures. For any EPA testing, we will rely on the procedures described in subpart F of this part, even if you used carryover data based on older test procedures as allowed under this paragraph (j).

(k)-(m) [Reserved]
