(c)Vehicles for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines and vehicles exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR part 1051. This applies to engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, and all other persons as if the highway motorcycles were recreational vehicles. The prohibited acts of 42 U.S.C. 7522 apply to these new highway motorcycles; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1051 for each recreational vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the highway motorcycle under this part 86 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines or vehicles do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR 1068.505.
