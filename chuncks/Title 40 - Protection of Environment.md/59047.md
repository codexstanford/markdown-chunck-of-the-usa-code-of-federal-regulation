####### Serious adverse effects.

(3)Any study in which testing or analysis of results is not yet complete but in which serious adverse effects have already been observed which may reasonably be attributed to exposure to the substances tested, because the effects observed in exposed organisms differ from effects observed in control organisms, are atypical in view of historical experience with the organism tested, or otherwise support a reasonable inference of causation, and 30 days have passed from the date the registrant first has the information.
