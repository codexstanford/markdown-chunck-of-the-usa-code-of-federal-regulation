(2) If an exemption from a prohibition has been granted in response to a petition filed under § 148.20 to allow injection of restricted wastes with respect to those wastes and wells covered by the exemption; or

(3) If the waste is generated by a conditionally exempt small quantity generator, as defined in § 261.5; or

(d) Wastes that are hazardous only because they exhibit a hazardous characteristic, and which are otherwise prohibited under this part, or part 268 of this chapter, are not prohibited if the wastes:
