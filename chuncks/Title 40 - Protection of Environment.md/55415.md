D.The permitting authority shall include a condition in the permit requiring the permittee to develop and conduct a pollutant minimization program for each pollutant with a WQBEL below the quantification level. The goal of the pollutant minimization program shall be to maintain the effluent at or below the WQBEL. In addition, States and Tribes may consider cost-effectiveness when evaluating the requirements of a PMP. The pollutant minimization program shall include, but is not limited to, the following:

1. An annual review and semi-annual monitoring of potential sources of the pollutant, which may include fish tissue monitoring and other bio-uptake sampling;

2. Quarterly monitoring for the pollutant in the influent to the wastewater treatment system;

3. Submittal of a control strategy designed to proceed toward the goal of maintaining the effluent below the WQBEL;

4. Implementation of appropriate, cost-effective control measures consistent with the control strategy; and

5. An annual status report that shall be sent to the permitting authority including:

a. All minimization program monitoring results for the previous year;

b. A list of potential sources of the pollutant; and

c. A summary of all action undertaken pursuant to the control strategy.

6. Any information generated as a result of procedure 8.D can be used to support a request for subsequent permit modifications, including revisions to (e.g., more or less frequent monitoring), or removal of the requirements of procedure 8.D, consistent with 40 CFR 122.44, 122.62 and 122.63.

The Great Lakes States and Tribes shall adopt provisions consistent with (as protective as) procedure 9 of appendix F of part 132.
