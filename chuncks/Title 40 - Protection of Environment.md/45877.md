####### Durability Procedure

2.

a. Set up a bench ignition system using an applicable distributor or an electro-mechanical equivalent.

b. Install the capacitor under test in the distributor adjusted to applicable vehicle manufacturer's specifications. Use applicable coil, primary resistor, breaker points, cap and rotor.

c. Connect the primary of the test system with a power supply regulated at 14 +/-0.5V DC for 12V system.

d. The secondary portion of the test system is to be connected to a 12 +/-2KV spark gap.

e. An external heat source shall generate an ambient temperature of 70 &#xB0;C (158 &#xB0;F) for the distributor.

f. Drive the distributor at 1750 +/-50 rpm for 200 hours. After each 50 hour interval, run the distributor for 5 minutes with one open circuit spark gap instead of a 12KV gap.

g. The replacement part must have the capability of performing throughout the duration of the test without evidence of any failure resulting in loss of spark in the 12KV spark gap.

h. After the 200 hours, the condenser shall be within 10 percent of the capacitance and voltage measured in 1.a. and b. respectively.
