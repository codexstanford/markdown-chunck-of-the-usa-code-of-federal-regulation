####### New affected source

means the collection of equipment, activities, or both, that if constructed after the issuance of a section 112(j) permit for the source pursuant to ยง 63.52, is subject to the applicable MACT emission limitation for new sources. Each permit must define the term "new affected source," which will be the same as the "affected source" unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:

(1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;

(2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;

(3) Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;

(4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;

(5) Incentives for pollution prevention;

(6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);

(7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and

(8) Other relevant factors.
