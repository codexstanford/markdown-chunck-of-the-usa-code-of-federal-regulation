######## Determine the effectiveness of the candidate sampler.

(6)(i) Determine the quantity of material collected on the candidate sampler's after filter using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for the candidate sampler as:

(ii) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as:

(iii) Repeat step in paragraph (f)(4) through (f)(6) of this section, as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.

(iv) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the test sampler as:

(v)(A) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the test sampler as:

(B) If the value of CVexceeds 10 percent, then the test run (steps in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(6) of this section) is unacceptable and must be repeated.

(7) Repeat steps in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(6) of this section for each particle size specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
