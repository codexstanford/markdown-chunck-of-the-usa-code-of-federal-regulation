####### Major change to monitoring

means a modification to federally required monitoring that uses "unproven technology or procedures" (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required monitoring is unsuitable). A major change to monitoring may be site-specific or may apply to one or more source categories and will almost always set a national precedent. Examples of major changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:

(1) Use of a new monitoring approach developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation;

(2) Use of a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) in place of a required continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS);

(3) Use of alternative calibration procedures that do not involve calibration gases or test cells;

(4) Use of an analytical technology that differs from that specified by a performance specification;

(5) Decreased monitoring frequency for a continuous emission monitoring system, continuous opacity monitoring system, predictive emission monitoring system, or continuous parameter monitoring system;

(6) Decreased monitoring frequency for a leak detection and repair program; and

(7) Use of alternative averaging times for reporting purposes.
