####### Calculation of SO,emissions from flares.

(4)Methods for calculating hourly and 3-hour SOemissions from flares shall be submitted to EPA as part of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Following approval by EPA, such methods shall be followed for calculating hourly and 3-hour SOemissions from a facility's flare(s).

(5) By October 20, 2008, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit a flare monitoring plan. Each flare monitoring plan shall include, at a minimum, the following:

(i) A facility plot plan showing the location of each flare in relation to the general plant layout;

(ii) Drawing(s) with dimensions, preferably to scale, and an as-built process flow diagram of the flare(s) identifying major components, such as flare header, flare stack, flare tip(s) or burner(s), purge gas system, pilot gas system, water seal, knockout drum, and molecular seal;

(iii) A representative flow diagram showing the interconnections of the flare system(s) with vapor recovery system(s), process units, and other equipment as applicable;

(iv) A complete description of the gas flaring process for an integrated gas flaring system that describes the method of operation of the flares;

(v) A complete description of the vapor recovery system(s) which have interconnection to a flare, such as compressor description(s); design capacities of each compressor and the vapor recovery system; and the method currently used to determine and record the amount of vapors recovered;

(vi) A complete description of the proposed method to monitor, determine, and record the total volume and total sulfur concentration of gases combusted in the flare, including drawing(s) with dimensions, preferably to scale, showing the following information for the proposed flare gas stream monitoring systems:

(A) The locations to be used for all monitoring and sampling, including, but not limited to: Flare flow monitors, total sulfur analyzers, concentration integrated sampling, concentration grab sampling, water seal monitoring devices, pilot and purge gas flow monitors, and pilot and purge gas concentration monitors;

(vii) A description of the method(s) used to determine, and reasoning behind, all monitoring and sampling locations;

(viii) The following information regarding pilot gas and purge gas for each flare:

(A) Type(s) of gas used;

(B) A complete description of the monitor(s) to be used, or the other parameters that will be used and monitored, to determine volumetric flows of the pilot gas and purge gas streams for which natural gas or inert gas is not used; and

(C) A complete description of the analyzer(s) to be used to determine, or other methods that will be used to estimate, the HS concentrations in the pilot gas and purge gas streams for which natural gas or inert gas is not used;

(ix) A detailed description of manufacturer's specifications, including, but not limited to, make, model, type, range, precision, accuracy, calibration, maintenance, quality assurance procedure, and any other relevant specifications and information referenced in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section for all existing and proposed flow monitoring devices and total sulfur analyzers;

(x) The following information if grab or integrated sampling is used:

(A) A complete description of proposed analytical and sampling methods if grab or integrated sampling methods will be used for determining the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream going to the flare;

(B) A detailed description of manufacturer's specifications, including, but not limited to, make, model, type, maintenance, and quality assurance procedures for the integrated sampling device, if used; and

(C) A complete description of the proposed method to alert personnel designated to collect samples that the trigger for collecting a sample has occurred;

(xi) A complete description of the methods to be used to estimate flare emissions when any flare, pilot gas, or purge gas volumetric flow monitoring devices, total sulfur analyzers, or grab or integrated sampling methods, or pilot gas or purge gas HS analyzers are not working or available, or the operating range of the monitors or analyzers is exceeded;

(xii) A complete description of the proposed data recording, collection, and management system and any other relevant specifications and information referenced in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section for each flare monitoring system;

(xiii) The following information for each flare using a water seal monitoring device:

(A) A detailed description of manufacturer's specifications, including, but not limited to, make, model, type, maintenance, and quality assurance procedures;

(B) A complete description of the proposed methods to determine that the water seal is no longer intact and flow is going to the flare, and the data used to establish, and reasoning behind, these methods;

(xiv) A schedule for the installation and operation of each flare monitoring system consistent with the deadline in paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) of this section; and

(xv) A complete description of the methods to be used for calculating hourly and 3-hour SOemissions from flares.

(6) Thirty (30) days prior to installing any continuous monitor or integrated sampler pursuant to paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit for EPA review a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plan for each monitor or sampler being installed.
