##### Appendix B to Part 72 - Methodology for Conversion of Emissions Limits

For the purposes of the Acid Rain Program, all emissions limits must be expressed in pounds of SOper million British Thermal Unit of heat input (lb/mmBtu).

The factor for converting pounds of sulfur to pounds of SOis based on the molecular weights of sulfur (32) and SO(64). Limits expressed as percentage of sulfur or parts per million (ppm) depend on the energy content of the fuel and thus may vary, depending on several factors such as fuel heat content and atmospheric conditions. Generic conversions for these limits are based on the assumed average energy contents listed in table A-2. In addition, limits in ppm vary with boiler operation (e.g., load and excess air); generic conversions for these limits assume, conservatively, very low excess air. The remaining factors are based on site-specific heat rates and capacities to develop conversions for Btu per hour. Standard conversion factors for residual oil are 42 gal/bbl and 7.88 lbs/gal.
