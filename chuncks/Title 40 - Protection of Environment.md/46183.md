####### EGR system malfunction criteria.

(ii)(A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes a decrease in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of EGR flow.

(B) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to an increase from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes an increase in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot reduce EGR flow.
