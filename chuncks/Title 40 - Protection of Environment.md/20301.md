###### Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
####### ยง 60.2110 What operating limits must I meet and by when?
######## e.g.,

(g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate for each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).

(h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to 10 percent opacity (1-hour block average).

(i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate continuing compliance, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:

(1) Determine your operating limit as the average PM CPMS output value recorded during the performance test or at a PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of the emission limit if your PM performance test demonstrates compliance below 75 percent of the emission limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test:

(i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output, or digital equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps;

(ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and
