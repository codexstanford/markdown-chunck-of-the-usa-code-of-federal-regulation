3.23A procedure in which a probe is rotated about its axis in a stack or duct until a zero differential pressure reading ("yaw null") is obtained. When a 3-D probe is yaw-nulled, its impact pressure port (P) faces directly into the direction of flow in the stack or duct and the differential pressure between pressure ports Pand Pis zero.
