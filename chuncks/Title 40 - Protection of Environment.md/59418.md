###### ยง 165.87 Design and capacity requirements for existing structures.
####### For all existing containment structures, what are the general design requirements?

(b)These are the general design requirements for existing containment structures:

(1) You must protect appurtenances and pesticide containers against damage from operating personnel and moving equipment. Means of protection include, but are not limited to, supports to prevent sagging, flexible connections, the use of guard rails, barriers, and protective cages.

(2) You must seal all appurtenances, discharge outlets and gravity drains through the base or wall of the containment structure, except for direct interconnections between adjacent containment structures which meet the requirements of this subpart.

(3) The containment structure must be constructed with sufficient freeboard to contain precipitation and prevent water and other liquids from seeping into or flowing onto it from adjacent land or structures.

(4) Multiple stationary pesticide containers may be protected within a single secondary containment unit.
