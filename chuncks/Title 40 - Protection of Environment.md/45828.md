####### Affects on vehicle on board diagnostic system.

(g)Installation of any certified aftermarket part shall not alter or render inoperative any feature of the on-board diagnostic system incorporated by the vehicle manufacturer. The certified part may integrate with the existing diagnostic system if it does not alter or render inoperative any features of the system. However, use of on-board diagnostics or warning indicators to alert the driver to part failure is not sufficient by itself to qualify the part for exemption from aging under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The part manufacturer must demonstrate that the diagnostic and malfunction indicator system will routinely result in repair or replacement of the aftermarket part in use.
