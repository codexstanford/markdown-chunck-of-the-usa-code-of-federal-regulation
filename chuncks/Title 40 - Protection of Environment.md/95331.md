() Once (k)and (k)are measured, determine the ratio R from equation 4:

(vii) Since the rate of photolysis in tubes is faster than the rate in natural water bodies, values of near-surface photolysis rate constants in natural and pure water bodies, kand k, respectively, can be obtained from (k)and (k)from Equations 5 and 6:
