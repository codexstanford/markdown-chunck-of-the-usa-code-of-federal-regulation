###### ยง 60.562-1 Standards: Process emissions.
####### Poly(ethylene terephthalate).

(c)Each owner or operator of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by ยง 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first.

(1) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a dimethyl terephthalate process shall:

(i) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) by complying with one of the following:

(A) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.018 kg TOC/Mg (0.036 lb TOC/ton) product; or

(B) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final condenser in the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) to exceed +3 &#xB0;C (+37 &#xB0;F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.

(ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors are used to provide vacuum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in ยง 60.564(j).

(A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) product; and

(B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or

(C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days.

(2) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a terephthalic acid process shall:

(i) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions from the esterification vessels in the raw materials preparation section to be greater than 0.04 kg TOC/Mg (0.08 lb TOC/ton) product.

(ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors are used to provide vaccum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in ยง 60.564(j).

(A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) product; and

(B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or

(C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days.

(d) Closed vent systems and control devices used to comply with this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to them.

(e) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the vent system from the emission source to the control device and car-sealed closed all valves in vent system that would lead the vent stream to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, bypassing the control device.
