####### Delay of repair.

(d)(1) Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected is allowed for equipment that is isolated from the process and that does not remain in diisocyanate service.

(2) Delay of repair for valves and connectors is also allowed if:

(i) The owner or operator determines that diisocyanate emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair are greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and

(ii) The purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device when repair procedures are effected, and

(iii) Repair is completed as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.

(3) Delay of repair for pumps is also allowed if repair requires replacing the existing seal design with a sealless pump, and repair is completed as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.
