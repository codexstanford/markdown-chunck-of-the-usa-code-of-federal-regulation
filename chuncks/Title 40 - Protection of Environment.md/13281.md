(e)-The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Calcasieu Parish on December 20, 1995. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act as a revision to the Louisiana ozone State Implementation Plan for Calcasieu Parish. The EPA therefore approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to ozone for Calcasieu Parish on June 2, 1997.
