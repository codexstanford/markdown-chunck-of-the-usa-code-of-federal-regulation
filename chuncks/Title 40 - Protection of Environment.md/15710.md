####### Method Detection Limit (MDL).
######## Tests for comparison correlation.

(h)(1) For each test site, calculate the (Pearson) correlation coefficient, r (not the coefficient of determination, r), using equation 21 of this section:

(2) For each test site, calculate the concentration coefficient of variation, CCV, using equation 22 of this section:

(3) To pass the test, the correlation coefficient, r, for each test site must not be less than the values, for various values of CCV, specified for correlation in table C-4 of this subpart. These limits are illustrated in figure C-4 of this subpart.
