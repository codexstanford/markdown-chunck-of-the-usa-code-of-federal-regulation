####### 5,Dose levels and dose selection.

()In subacute toxicity tests, it is desirable to have a dose response relationship as well as a NOAEL. Therefore, at least 3 dose levels with a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest exposure level) shall be used. Doses shall be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve.
