####### Requirement for a permit.

(b)Except as provided in the following sentence, ยง 71.6(a)(13), and paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and e(2)(v) of this section, no part 71 source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application under this part, except in compliance with a permit issued under this part. If a part 71 source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a part 71 permit is not a violation of this part until the permitting authority takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and as required by ยง 71.5(c), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the permitting authority any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.
