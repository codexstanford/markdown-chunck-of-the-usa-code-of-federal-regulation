####### Maintenance that is not emission-related.

(e)You may schedule any amount of maintenance unrelated to emission controls that is needed for proper functioning of the engine. This might include adding engine oil; changing air, fuel, or oil filters; servicing engine-cooling systems; adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, timing, or tension of air pump drive belts; and lubricating the heat control valve in the exhaust manifold. For maintenance that is not emission-related, you may perform the maintenance during service accumulation on your emission-data engines at the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser (but not the intervals recommended for special situations).

(f) [Reserved]
