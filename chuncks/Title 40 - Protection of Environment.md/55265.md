###### Calculation of a Baseline BAF from a Field-Measured BSAF.

E.1. A baseline BAF for organic chemical "i" shall be calculated from a field-measured BSAF of acceptable quality using the following equation:

2. A BSAF shall be calculated using the following equation:

3. The organic carbon-normalized concentration of a chemical in sediment, C, shall be calculated using the following equation:

4. Predicting BAFs from BSAFs requires data from a steady-state (or near steady-state) condition between sediment and ambient water for both a reference chemical "r" with a field-measured BAFfd and other chemicals "n = i" for which BSAFs are to be determined.

5. The trophic level to which the baseline BAF applies is the same as the trophic level of the organisms used in the determination of the BSAF. For each trophic level, a species mean baseline BAF shall be calculated as the geometric mean if more than one baseline BAF is predicted from BSAFs for a given species. For each trophic level, the geometric mean of the species mean baseline BAFs derived using BSAFs shall be calculated.

6. If a baseline BAF based on a measured BSAF is available for either trophic level 3 or 4, but not both, a baseline BAF for the other trophic level shall be calculated using the ratio of the FCMs that are obtained by linear interpolation from Table B-1 for the chemical.
