a. The formulation and application of air quality models are accompanied by several sources of uncertainty. "Irreducible" uncertainty stems from the "unknown" conditions, which may not be explicitly accounted for in the model (the turbulent velocity field). Thus, there are likely to be deviations from the observed concentrations in individual events due to variations in the unknown conditions. "Reducible" uncertaintiesare caused by: (1) Uncertainties in the "known" input conditions (emission characteristics and meteorological data); (2) errors in the measured concentrations; and (3) inadequate model physics and formulation.

b. Evaluations of model accuracy should focus on the reducible uncertainty associated with physics and the formulation of the model. The accuracy of the model is normally determined by an evaluation procedure which involves the comparison of model concentration estimates with measured air quality data.The statement of model accuracy is based on statistical tests or performance measures such as bias, error, correlation, etc.

c. Since the 1980's, the EPA has worked with the modeling community to encourage development of standardized model evaluation methods and the development of continually improved methods for the characterization of model performance.There is general consensus on what should be considered in the evaluation of air quality models; namely, quality assurance planning, documentation and scrutiny should be consistent with the intended use and should include:

- Scientific peer review;

- Supportive analyses (diagnostic evaluations, code verification, sensitivity analyses);

- Diagnostic and performance evaluations with data obtained in trial locations; and

- Statistical performance evaluations in the circumstances of the intended applications.
