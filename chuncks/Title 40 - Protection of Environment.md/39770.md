###### Notifications, Reports and Records
####### ยง 63.11985 What notifications and reports must I submit and when?
######## Notification of inspection.

(1)To provide the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present, you must notify the Administrator at least 30 days before an inspection required by ยง 63.11910(a)(3). If an inspection is unplanned and you could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance, then you must notify the Administrator at least 7 days before the inspection. Notification must be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days before the inspection. If a delegated state or local agency is notified, you are not required to notify the Administrator. A delegated state or local agency may waive the requirement for notification of inspections.
