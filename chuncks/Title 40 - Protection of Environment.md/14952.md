(c)The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Texas on March 31, 2009, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOand SOfrom electric generating units.

(e) The following portions of the Texas regional haze SIP submitted March 19, 2009 are disapproved: The reasonable progress four-factor analysis, reasonable progress goals and the calculation of the emission reductions needed to achieve the uniform rates of progress for the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend; calculation of natural visibility conditions; calculation of the number of deciviews by which baseline conditions exceed natural visibility conditions; long-term strategy consultations with Oklahoma; Texas securing its share of reductions necessary to achieve the reasonable progress goals at Big Bend, the Guadalupe Mountains, and the Wichita Mountains; technical basis for its long-term strategy and emission limitations and schedules for compliance to achieve the reasonable progress goals for Big Bend, the Guadalupe Mountains and Wichita Mountains.
