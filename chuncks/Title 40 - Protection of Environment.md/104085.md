###### ยง 1068.105 What other provisions apply to me specifically if I manufacture equipment needing certified engines?
####### Installing engines or certified components.

(b)The provisions in ยง 1068.101(a)(1) generally prohibit you from introducing into U.S. commerce any new equipment that includes engines not covered by a certificate of conformity. In addition, you must follow the engine manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions. For example, you may need to constrain where you place an exhaust aftertreatment device or integrate into your equipment models a device for sending visual or audible signals to the operator. Similarly, you must follow the emission-related installation instructions from the manufacturer of a component that has been certified for controlling evaporative emissions under 40 CFR part 1060. Not meeting the manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions is a violation of one or more of the prohibitions of ยง 1068.101. See ยง 1068.261 for special provisions that apply when the engine manufacturer delegates final assembly of emission controls to you.
