####### Volume.

(D)The maximum volume of liquid that can be administered at one time depends on the size of the test animal. In rodents, the volume should not exceed 1 mL/100 g body weight, except when an aqueous solution is used in which case 2 mL/100 g may be administered. Either constant volume or constant concentration administration is acceptable when dosing, provided the following guidance is employed. When possible, the liquid test material should be dosed neat. Otherwise, it may be diluted, using the highest concentration possible, although volumes less than 0.5 mL per animal would not be required. Lower dose volumes are acceptable if they can be accurately administered. Solid materials should be suspended or dissolved in the minimum amount of vehicle and dosed at the highest concentration possible.
