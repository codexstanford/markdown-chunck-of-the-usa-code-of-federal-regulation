(iv) When ยง 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B)() specifies that condenser-controlled emissions from an air dryer must be calculated using Equation 11 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with "V equal to the air flow rate," it means "V equal to the dryer outlet gas flow rate," for the purposes of this subpart. Alternatively, you may use Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with V equal to the dryer inlet air flow rate. Account for time as appropriate in either equation.
