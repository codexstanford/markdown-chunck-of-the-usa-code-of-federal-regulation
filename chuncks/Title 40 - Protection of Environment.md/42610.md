####### i.e.

(v) For each parameter monitored (, SO, CO, O, NO, Hg or flow rate) at each unit or stack, a regular non-redundant backup CEMS may not be used to report data at that affected unit or common stack for more than 720 hours in any one calendar year (or 720 hours in any ozone season, for sources that report emission data only during the ozone season, in accordance with ยง 75.74(c)), unless the CEMS passes a RATA at that unit or stack. For each parameter monitored at each unit or stack, the use of a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer (or analyzers) is restricted to 720 cumulative hours per calendar year (or ozone season, as applicable), unless the owner or operator redesignates the like-kind replacement analyzer(s) as component(s) of regular non-redundant backup CEMS and each redesignated CEMS passes a RATA at that unit or stack.

(vi) For each regular non-redundant backup CEMS, no more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse following the quarter in which the last RATA of the CEMS was done at a particular unit or stack, without performing a subsequent RATA. Otherwise, the CEMS may not be used to report data from that unit or stack until the hour of completion of a passing RATA at that location.
