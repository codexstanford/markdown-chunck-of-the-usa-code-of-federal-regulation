###### ยง 1065.140 Dilution for gaseous and PM constituents.
####### Aqueous condensation.

(6)You must address aqueous condensation in the CVS as described in this paragraph (c)(6). You may meet these requirements by preventing or limiting aqueous condensation in the CVS from the exhaust inlet to the last emission sample probe. See paragraph (c)(6)(2)(B) of this section for provisions related to the CVS between the last emission sample probe and the CVS flow meter. You may heat and/or insulate the dilution tunnel walls, as well as the bulk stream tubing downstream of the tunnel to prevent or limit aqueous condensation. Where we allow aqueous condensation to occur, use good engineering judgment to ensure that the condensation does not affect your ability to demonstrate that your engines comply with the applicable standards in this chapter (see ยง 1065.10(a)).
