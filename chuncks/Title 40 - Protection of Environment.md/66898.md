(iii) To determine compliance with the 20 parts per million by volume TOC limit in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section, the Sistersville Plant shall use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure TOC minus methane and ethane. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The following procedures shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration, corrected to 3 percent oxygen:

(A) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15 minute intervals during the run.

(B) The concentration of TOC minus methane and ethane (C) shall be calculated as the sum of the concentrations of the individual components, and shall be computed for each run using the following equation:

(C) The concentration of TOC shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen if a combustion device is the control device.
