The data recorder resolution (i.e., readability) must be no greater than 1 ppm for CO; 0.1 percent for O; and one degree (either &#xB0;C or &#xB0;F) for temperature. Alternatively, you may use a digital or analog meter having the same resolution to observe and manually record the analyzer responses.
