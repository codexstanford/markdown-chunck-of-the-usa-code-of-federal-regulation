###### Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls Option
####### § 63.4951 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?

You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source to demonstrate compliance with an organic HAP emission limit. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must comply with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, but is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards in §§ 63.4892 and 63.4893, respectively. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890 for the coating operation or group of coating operations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to include organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option.
