###### ยง 85.2122 Emission-critical parameters.
####### Capacitors/Condensers.

(6)(i) The emission-critical parameters for capacitors/condensers are:

(A) Capacitance.

(B) Series Resistance.

(C) Breakdown Voltage.

(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph:

(A) "Capacitance" means the property of a device which permits storage of electrically-separated charges when differences in electrical potential exist between the conductors and measured as the ratio of stored charge to the difference in electrical potential between conductors.

(B) "Series Resistance" means the sum of resistances from the condenser plates to the condenser's external connections.

(C) "Breakdown Voltage" means the voltage level at which the capacitor fails.

(D) "Capacitor/Condenser" means a device for the storage of electrical energy consisting of two oppositely charged conducting plates separated by a dielectric and which resists the flow of direct current.
