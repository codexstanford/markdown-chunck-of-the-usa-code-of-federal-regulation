######## Test for comparability.

(j)(1) For each site, plot all of the average PMor PMmeasurements obtained with the candidate method (C) against the corresponding average PMor PMmeasurements obtained with the reference method (R. For each site, calculate and record the linear regression slope and intercept, and the correlation coefficient.

(2) To pass the test for comparability, the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient calculated under paragraph (j)(1) of this section must be within the limits specified in table C-4 of this subpart for all test sites.
