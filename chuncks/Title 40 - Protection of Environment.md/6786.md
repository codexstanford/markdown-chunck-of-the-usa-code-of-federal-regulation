(ii) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase (the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs IV.I.1(iii) through (v) of this Ruling. The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph II.A.6 of this Ruling. Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase.
