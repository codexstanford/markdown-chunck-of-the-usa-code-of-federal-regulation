######## Planned routine maintenance.

(c)The emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart for control devices used to control emissions from storage tanks do not apply during periods of planned routine maintenance. Periods of planned routine maintenance of each control device, during which the control device does not meet the emission limit specified in Table 2 to this subpart, must not exceed 240 hours per year (hr/yr). You may submit an application to the Administrator requesting an extension of this time limit to a total of 360 hr/yr. The application must explain why the extension is needed, it must indicate that no material will be added to the storage tank between the time the 240 hr/yr limit is exceeded and the control device is again operational, and it must be submitted at least 60 days before the 240 hr/yr limit will be exceeded.
