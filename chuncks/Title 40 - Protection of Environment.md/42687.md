###### ยง 75.53 Monitoring plan.
####### e.g.,,e.g.,

(iv) Identification and description of each monitoring system component (including each monitor and its identifiable components, such as analyzer and/or probe) in the CEMS (SOpollutant concentration monitor, flow monitor, moisture monitor; NOpollutant concentration monitor, and diluent gas monitor), the continuous opacity monitoring system, or the excepted monitoring system (fuel flowmeter, data acquisition and handling system), including:

(A) Manufacturer, model number and serial number;

(B) Component/system identification code assigned by the utility to each identifiable monitoring component (such as the analyzer and/or probe). Each code shall use a three-digit format, unique to each monitoring component and unique to each monitoring system;

(C) Designation of the component type and method of sample acquisition or operation, (e.g., in situ pollutant concentration monitor or thermal flow monitor);

(D) Designation of the system as a primary, redundant backup, non-redundant backup, data backup, or reference method backup system, as provided in ยง 75.10(e);

(E) First and last dates the system reported data;

(F) Status of the monitoring component; and

(G) Parameter monitored.

(v) Identification and description of all major hardware and software components of the automated data acquisition and handling system, including:

(A) Hardware components that perform emission calculations or store data for quarterly reporting purposes (provide the manufacturer and model number); and

(B) Software components (provide the identification of the provider and model/version number).

(vi) Explicit formulas for each measured emission parameter, using component/system identification codes for the primary system used to measure the parameter that links CEMS or excepted monitoring system observations with reported concentrations, mass emissions, or emission rates, according to the conversions listed in appendix D or E to this part. Formulas for backup monitoring systems are required only if different formulas for the same parameter are used for the primary and backup monitoring systems (e.g., if the primary system measures pollutant concentration on a different moisture basis from the backup system). The formulas must contain all constants and factors required to derive mass emissions or emission rates from component/system code observations and an indication of whether the formula is being added, corrected, deleted, or is unchanged. Each emissions formula is identified with a unique three digit code. The owner or operator of a low mass emissions unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional low mass emissions excepted methodology in ยง 75.19(c) is not required to report such formulas.

(vii) Inside cross-sectional area (ft) at flue exit (for all units) and at flow monitoring location (for units with flow monitors, only).

(viii) Stack exit height (ft) above ground level and ground level elevation above sea level.

(ix) Monitoring location identification, facility identification code as assigned by the Administrator for use under the Acid Rain Program or this part, and the following information, as reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA): facility identification number, flue identification number, boiler identification number, ARP/Subpart H facility ID number or ORISPL number (as applicable), reporting year, and 767 reporting indicator (or equivalent).

(x) For each parameter monitored: Scale, maximum potential concentration (and method of calculation), maximum expected concentration (if applicable) (and method of calculation), maximum potential flow rate (and method of calculation), maximum potential NOemission rate, span value, full-scale range, daily calibration units of measure, span effective date/hour, span inactivation date/hour, indication of whether dual spans are required, default high range value, flow rate span, and flow rate span value and full scale value (in scfh) for each unit or stack using SO, NO, CO, O, or flow component monitors.

(xi) If the monitoring system or excepted methodology provides for the use of a constant, assumed, or default value for a parameter under specific circumstances, then include the following information for each such value for each parameter:

(A) Identification of the parameter;

(B) Default, maximum, minimum, or constant value, and units of measure for the value;

(C) Purpose of the value;

(D) Indicator of use during controlled/uncontrolled hours;

(E) Type of fuel;

(F) Source of the value;

(G) Value effective date and hour;

(H) Date and hour value is no longer effective (if applicable); and

(I) For units using the excepted methodology under ยง 75.19, the applicable SOemission factor.

(xii) Uless otherwise specified in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, for each unit of common stack on which hardware CEMS are installed:

(A) The upper and lower boundaries of the range of operation (as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part), expressed in megawatts, or thousands of lb/hr of steam, or ft/sec (as applicable);

(B) The load or operating level(s) designated as normal in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, expressed in megawatts, or thousands of lb/hr of steam, or ft/sec (as applicable);
