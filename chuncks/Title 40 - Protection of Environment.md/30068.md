######## Carbon monoxide readings exceeding the span.

(3)(i) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if a carbon monoxide CEMS detects a response that results in a one-minute average at or above the 3,000 ppmv span level required by Performance Specification 4B in appendix B, part 60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be recorded as 10,000 ppmv. The one-minute 10,000 ppmv value must be used for calculating the hourly rolling average carbon monoxide level.

(ii) Carbon monoxide CEMS that use a span value of 10,000 ppmv when one-minute carbon monoxide levels are equal to or exceed 3,000 ppmv are not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Carbon monoxide CEMS that use a span value of 10,000 are subject to the same CEMS performance and equipment specifications when operating in the range of 3,000 ppmv to 10,000 ppmv that are provided by Performance Specification 4B for other carbon monoxide CEMS, except:

(A) Calibration drift must be less than 300 ppmv; and

(B) Calibration error must be less than 500 ppmv.
