######## Startup

means the setting in operation of a continuous operation for any purpose; the first time a new or reconstructed batch operation begins production; for new equipment added, including equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put into operation; or for the introduction of a new product/process, the first time the product or process is run in equipment. For batch operations, startup applies to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past if the steps taken to begin production differ from those specified in a standard batch or nonstandard batch. Startup does not apply when the equipment is put into operation as part of a batch within a campaign when the steps taken are routine operations.
