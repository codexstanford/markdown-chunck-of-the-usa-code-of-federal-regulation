######## What are the procedures that the Regional Administrator will follow to require an operating permit?

(e)(1) Whenever the Regional Administrator determines that additional Federally-enforceable requirements are necessary to ensure compliance with the implementation plan or to ensure the attainment and maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard or prevention of significant deterioration increment, the owner or operator of the air pollution source will be so notified in writing.

(2) The Regional Administrator may require that the owner or operator provide any information that the Regional Administrator determines is necessary to establish such requirements in a permit to operate under this section.

(3) The Regional Administrator will prepare a draft permit to operate and a draft technical support document that describes the reasons and need for the proposed requirements.

(4) The Regional Administrator will provide a copy of the draft permit to operate and draft technical support document to the owner or operator of the air pollution source and will provide an opportunity for the owner or operator to meet with EPA and discuss the proposed requirements.

(5) The Regional Administrator will provide an opportunity for public comment on the draft permit to operate as follows:

(i) A copy of the draft permit to operate, the draft technical support document, and all other supporting materials will be made available for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected by the air pollution source.

(ii) A notice will be made by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the air pollution source of the availability of the draft permit to operate and supporting materials and of the opportunity to comment. Where possible, notices will also be made in the Tribal newspaper.

(iii) Copies of the notice will be provided to the owner or operator of the air pollution source, the Tribal governing body, and the Tribal, State, and local air pollution authorities having jurisdiction in areas outside of the Indian reservation potentially impacted by the air pollution source.

(iv) A 30-day period for submittal of public comments will be provided starting upon the date of publication of the notice. If requested, the Regional Administrator may hold a public hearing and/or extend the public comment period for up to an additional 30 days.

(6) After the close of the public comment period, the Regional Administrator will review all comments received and prepare a final permit to operate and final technical support document, unless the Regional Administrator determines that additional requirements are not necessary to ensure compliance with the implementation plan or to ensure the attainment and maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard or prevention of significant deterioration increment. The final technical support document will include a response to all comments received during the public comment period.

(7) The final permit to operate and final technical support document will be sent to the owner or operator of the air pollution source and will be made available at all of the locations where the draft permit was made available. In addition, the final permit to operate and final technical support document will be sent to all persons who provided comments on the draft permit to operate.

(8) The final permit to operate will be a final agency action for purposes of administrative appeal and judicial review.
