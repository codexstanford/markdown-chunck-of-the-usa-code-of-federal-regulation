means an emission control technology that experiences a significant drop in emission control performance or emission-system durability when an engine is operated on low-sulfur diesel fuel (fuel with a sulfur concentration of 300 to 500 ppm) as compared to when it is operated on ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel (fuel with a sulfur concentration less than 15 ppm). Exhaust gas recirculation is not a sulfur-sensitive technology.
