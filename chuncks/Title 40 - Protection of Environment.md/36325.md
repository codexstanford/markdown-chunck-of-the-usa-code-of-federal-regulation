###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.6120 What performance tests and other procedures must I use?
######## e.g.,,e.g.,

(1) Identification of the parameters associated with operation of the stationary combustion turbine and any emission control device which could change intentionally (operator adjustment, automatic controller adjustment, etc.) or unintentionally (wear and tear, error, etc.) on a routine basis or over time;

(2) A discussion of the relationship, if any, between changes in the parameters and changes in HAP emissions;

(3) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of why establishing limitations on the parameters is not possible;

(4) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of why you could not establish upper and/or lower values for the parameters which would establish limits on the parameters as operating limitations;

(5) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion identifying the methods you could use to measure them and the instruments you could use to monitor them, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of the methods and instruments;

(6) For the parameters, a discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you could use to monitor them; and

(7) A discussion of why, from your point of view, it is infeasible, unreasonable or unnecessary to adopt the parameters as operating limitations.
