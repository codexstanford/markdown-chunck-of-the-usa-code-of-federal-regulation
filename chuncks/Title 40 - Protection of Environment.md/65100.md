####### ยง 257.74 Structural integrity criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment.

(a) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section apply to all new CCR surface impoundments and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment, except for those new CCR surface impoundments that are incised CCR units. If an incised CCR surface impoundment is subsequently modified (e.g., a dike is constructed) such that the CCR unit no longer meets the definition of an incised CCR unit, the CCR unit is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

(1) No later than the initial receipt of CCR, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must place on or immediately adjacent to the CCR unit a permanent identification marker, at least six feet high showing the identification number of the CCR unit, if one has been assigned by the state, the name associated with the CCR unit and the name of the owner or operator of the CCR unit.
