####### § 63.4490 What emission limits must I meet?

(a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.4541, § 63.4551, or § 63.4561.

(1) For each new general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.16 kg (0.16 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(2) For each new automotive lamp coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.26 kg (0.26 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(3) For each new TPO coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.22 kg (0.22 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(4) For each new assembled on-road vehicle coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.34 kg (1.34 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(b) For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.4541, § 63.4551, or § 63.4561.

(1) For each existing general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.16 kg (0.16 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(2) For each existing automotive lamp coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.45 kg (0.45 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(3) For each existing TPO coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.26 kg (0.26 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(4) For each existing assembled on-road vehicle coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.34 kg (1.34 lb) organic HAP emitted per kg (lb) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.

(c) If your facility's surface coating operations meet the applicability criteria of more than one of the subcategory emission limits specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, you may comply separately with each subcategory emission limit or comply using one of the alternatives in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
