########### Appendix C to Part 72 - Actual 1985 Yearly SOEmissions Calculation

The equation used to calculate the yearly SOemissions (SO2) is as follows:

If gas is the only fuel, gas emissions are defaulted to 0.

Each fuel type SOemissions is calculated on a yearly basis, using the equation:

For coal, the yearly fuel burned is in tons/yr and the AP-42 factor (which accounts for the ash retention of sulfur in coal), in lbs SOton coal, is by coal type:

For oil, the yearly fuel burned is in gal/yr. If it is in bbl/yr, convert using 42 gal/bbl oil. The AP-42 factor (which accounts for the oil density), in lbs SO/thousand gal oil, is by oil type:

For all fuel, the units conversion factor is 1 ton/2000 lbs.
