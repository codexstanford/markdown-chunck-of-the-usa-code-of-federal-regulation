####### Fiber-bed mist eliminator.

(4)(i) During the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, complying with the emission limitations in § 63.342 through the use of a fiber-bed mist eliminator shall determine the outlet chromium concentration using the procedures in § 63.344(c), and shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter the pressure drop across the fiber-bed mist eliminator and the pressure drop across the control device installed upstream of the fiber bed to prevent plugging, setting the value that corresponds to compliance with the applicable emission limitation using the procedures in § 63.344(d)(5). An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant pressure drop values, or may set as the compliant value the average pressure drop measured over the three test runs of one performance test and accept +/-1 inch of water column from this value as the compliant range.

(ii) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is required to be completed under § 63.7, the owner or operator of an affected source, or group of affected sources under common control, shall monitor and record the pressure drop across the fiber-bed mist eliminator, and the control device installed upstream of the fiber bed to prevent plugging, once each day that any affected source is operating. To be in compliance with the standards, the fiber-bed mist eliminator and the upstream control device shall be operated within +/-1 inch of water column of the pressure drop value established during the initial performance test, or shall be operated within the range of compliant values for pressure drop established during multiple performance tests.
