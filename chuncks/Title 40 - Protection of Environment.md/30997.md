(c)(1) The closed-vent system shall route all gases, vapors, and fumes emitted from the material in an emissions unit to a control device that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) The closed-vent system shall be designed and operated with no detectable emissions.

(3) If the closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices that could be used to divert all or a portion of the gases, vapors, or fumes from entering the control device, the owner or operator shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) For each bypass device, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall either:

(A) At the inlet to the bypass device that could divert the stream away from the control device to the atmosphere, properly install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that is capable of taking periodic readings and sounding an alarm when the bypass device is open such that the stream is being, or could be, diverted away from the control device to the atmosphere; or

(B) Secure the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device in the non-diverting position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration.

(ii) Low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and safety devices are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
