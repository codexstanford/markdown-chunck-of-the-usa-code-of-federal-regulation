####### Histopathology.

(11)(i) The following histopathology shall be performed:

(A) Full histopathology on organs and tissues listed above of all animals in the control and high dose groups and all animals that died or were killed during the study.

(B) All gross lesions in all animals.

(C) Target organs in all animals.

(ii) If a significant difference is observed in hyperplastic, pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions between the highest dose and control groups, microscopic examination shall be made on that particular organ or tissue of all animals in the study.

(iii) If excessive early deaths or other problems occur in the high dose group, compromising the significance of the data, the next lower dose level shall be examined for complete histopathology.

(iv) In case the results of an experiment give evidence of substantial alteration of the animals' normal longevity or the induction of effects that might affect a neoplastic response, the next lower dose level shall be examined fully as described in this section.

(v) An attempt shall be made to correlate gross observations with microscopic findings.
