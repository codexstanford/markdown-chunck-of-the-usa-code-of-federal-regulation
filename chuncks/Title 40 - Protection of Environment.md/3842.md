######## Lowest achievable emission rate

means the more stringent rate of emissions based on the following:

(1) The most stringent emissions limitation which is contained in any State, Tribal, or federal implementation plan for such class or category of stationary source, unless the owner or operator of the project demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or

(2) The most stringent emissions limitation which is achieved in practice by such class or category of stationary sources. This limitation, when applied to a modification, means the lowest achievable emissions rate for the new or modified emissions units within a stationary source. In no event shall the application of the term permit a proposed new or modified stationary source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under an applicable new source standard of performance.
