###### Extractive System.

8.6.1An extractive system maintained at 180 &#xB0;C (360 &#xB0;F) or higher which is capable of directing a total flow of at least 12 L/min to the sample cell is required (References 1 and 2). Insert the probe into the duct or stack at a point representing the average volumetric flow rate and 25 percent of the cross sectional area. Co-locate an appropriate flow monitoring device with the sample probe so that the flow rate is recorded at specified time intervals during emission testing (e.g., differential pressure measurements taken every 10 minutes during each run).
