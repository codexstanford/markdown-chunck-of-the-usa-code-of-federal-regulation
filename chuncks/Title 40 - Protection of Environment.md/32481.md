####### Determination of average flow rate and annual average flow rate.

(d)The owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU, the total annual average flow rate for the combination of all process vents from batch unit operations that are associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify a product in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The annual average flow rate for each process vent from batch unit operations that is associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product shall be determined using the batch process vent procedures in the NESHAP for Group I Polymers and Resins (40 CFR part 63, subpart U), ยง 63.488(e).

(2) The owner or operator shall sum the annual average flow rates from the individual process vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU, determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to obtain the total annual average flow rate for the combination of process vents associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product, for the PMPU.
