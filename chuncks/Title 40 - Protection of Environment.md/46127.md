####### NO,adsorber system malfunction criteria,NO,adsorber system capability.

(ii)-(A)The OBD system must detect a NOadsorber malfunction when its capability (i.e., its combined adsorption and conversion capability) decreases to the point that would cause an engine's NOemissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for NOaftertreatment systems as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). If no failure or deterioration of the NOadsorber capability could result in an engine's NOemissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of NOadsorber capability.
