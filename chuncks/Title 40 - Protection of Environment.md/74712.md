####### Non-continuous discharger.

(k)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a non-continuous discharger is a mill which is prohibited by the NPDES authority from discharging pollutants during specific periods of time for reasons other than treatment plant upset control, such periods being at least 24 hours in duration. A mill shall not be deemed a non-continuous discharger unless its permit, in addition to setting forth the prohibition described above, requires compliance with the effluent limitations established for non-continuous dischargers and also requires compliance with maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations. Such maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for non-continuous dischargers shall be established by the NPDES authority in the form of concentrations which reflect wastewater treatment levels that are representative of the application of the best practicable control technology currently available, the best conventional pollutant control technology, or new source performance standards in lieu of the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for conventional pollutants set forth in each subpart.

(2) A mill is a non-continuous discharger for the purposes of determining applicable effluent limitations under subpart B or E of this part (other than conventional limits for existing sources) if, for reasons other than treatment plant upset control (e.g., protecting receiving water quality), the mill is prohibited by the NPDES authority from discharging pollutants during specific periods of time or if it is required to release its discharge on a variable flow or pollutant loading rate basis.
