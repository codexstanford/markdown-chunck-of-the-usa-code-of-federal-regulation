####### Date of manufacture

means the date on which a manufacturer is issued documentation by FAA (or other recognized airworthiness authority for engines certificated outside the United States) attesting that the given engine conforms to all applicable requirements. This date may not be earlier than the date on which engine assembly is complete. Where the manufacturer does not obtain such documentation from FAA (or other recognized airworthiness authority for engines certificated outside the United States), date of manufacture means the date of final engine assembly.
