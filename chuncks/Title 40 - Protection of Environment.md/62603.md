(b)At the end of the closure period:

(1) Disposal areas shall each comply with the closure performance standard in ยง 264.111 of this chapter with respect to nonradiological hazards and shall be designedto provide reasonable assurance of control of radiological hazards to

(ii) Limit releases of radon-222 from uranium byproduct materials to the atmosphere so as to not exceed an averagerelease rate of 20 picocuries per square meter per second (pCi/m2s).

(2) The requirements of ยง 192.32(b)(1) shall not apply to any portion of a licensed and/or disposal site which contains a concentration of radium-226 in land, averaged over areas of 100 square meters, which, as a result of uranium byproduct material, does not exceed the background level by more than:

(i) 5 picocuries per gram (pCi/g), averaged over the first 15 centimeters (cm) below the surface, and

(ii) 15 pCi/g, averaged over 15 cm thick layers more than 15 cm below the surface.
