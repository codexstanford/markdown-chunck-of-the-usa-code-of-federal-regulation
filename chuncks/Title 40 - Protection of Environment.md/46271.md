####### Erasure of diagnostic information.

(ix)(A) For purposes of this paragraph (k)(4)(ix), "emission-related diagnostic information" includes all of the following: ready status as required by paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section; data stream information as required by paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section including the number of stored MIL-on DTCs, distance traveled while MIL activated, number of warm-up cycles since DTC memory last erased, and distance traveled since DTC memory last erased; freeze frame information as required by paragraph (k)(4)(iii) of this section; pending, MIL-on, and previous-MIL-on DTCs as required by paragraph (k)(4)(iv) of this section; and, test results as required by paragraph (k)(4)(v) of this section.

(B) For all engines, the emission-related diagnostic information must be erased if commanded by any scan tool and may be erased if the power to the on-board computer is disconnected. If any of the emission-related diagnostic information is commanded to be erased by any scan tool, all emission-related diagnostic information must be erased from all diagnostic or emission critical control units. The OBD system shall not allow a scan tool to erase a subset of the emission-related diagnostic information (e.g., the OBD system shall not allow a scan tool to erase only one of three stored DTCs or only information from one control unit without erasing information from the other control unit(s)).
