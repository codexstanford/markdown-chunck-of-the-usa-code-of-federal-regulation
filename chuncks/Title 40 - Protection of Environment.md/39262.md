######## Startup,

for a unit operation with a continuous process vent, means the setting in operation of the unit for any purpose. The period of startup ends upon completion of the transient, non-equilibrium step at the time operating conditions reach steady state for operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, composition, feed rate, and production rate. Periods of startup described by SOP manuals at the affected source may be used to determine the period of startup.
