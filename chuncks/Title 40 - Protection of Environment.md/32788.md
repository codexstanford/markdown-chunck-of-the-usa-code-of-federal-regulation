######## Feed/charge weight measurement.

(k)During the emission test(s) conducted to determine compliance with emission limits in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) format, the owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit, subject to an emission limit in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge format, must measure (or otherwise determine) and record the total weight of feed/charge to the affected source or emission unit for each of the three test runs and calculate and record the total weight. An owner or operator that chooses to demonstrate compliance on the basis of the aluminum production weight must measure the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit or affected source instead of the feed/charge weight.
