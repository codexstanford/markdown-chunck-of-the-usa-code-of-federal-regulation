#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart RRR - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Secondary Aluminum Production
###### Notifications, Reports, And Records
####### ยง 63.1516 Reports.
######## e.g.,

(iv) An excursion of a compliant process or operating parameter value or range (lime injection rate or screw feeder setting, total reactive chlorine flux injection rate, afterburner operating temperature, fabric filter inlet temperature, definition of acceptable scrap, or other approved operating parameter).

(v) [Reserved]

(vi) An affected source (including an emission unit in a secondary aluminum processing unit) was not operated according to the requirements of this subpart.

(vii) A deviation from the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission limit for a secondary aluminum processing unit.

(2) Each report must include each of these certifications, as applicable:

(i) For each thermal chip dryer: "Only unpainted aluminum chips were used as feedstock in any thermal chip dryer during this reporting period."

(ii) For each dross-only furnace: "Only dross and salt flux were used as the charge materials in any dross-only furnace during this reporting period."

(iii) For each sidewell group 1 furnace with add-on air pollution control devices: "Each furnace was operated such that the level of molten metal remained above the top of the passage between the sidewell and hearth during reactive fluxing, and reactive flux, except for cover flux, was added only to the sidewell or to a furnace hearth equipped with an add-on air pollution control device for PM, HCl, and D/F emissions during this reporting period."

(iv) For each group 1 melting/holding furnace without add-on air pollution control devices and using pollution prevention measures that processes only clean charge material: "Each group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices subject to emission limits in ยง 63.1505(i)(2) processed only clean charge during this reporting period."

(v) For each group 2 furnace: "Only clean charge materials were processed in any group 2 furnace during this reporting period, and no fluxing was performed or all fluxing performed was conducted using only nonreactive, non-HAP-containing/non-HAP-generating fluxing gases or agents, except for cover fluxes, during this reporting period."

(vi) For each in-line fluxer using no reactive flux: "Only nonreactive, non-HAP-containing, non-HAP-generating flux gases, agents, or materials were used at any time during this reporting period."

(vii) For each affected source choosing to demonstrate compliance during periods of startup and shutdown in accordance with ยง 63.1513(f)(1): "During each startup and shutdown, no flux and no feed/charge were added to the emission unit, and electricity, propane or natural gas were used as the sole source of heat or the emission unit was not heated."

(3) The owner or operator must submit the results of any performance test conducted during the reporting period, including one complete report documenting test methods and procedures, process operation, and monitoring parameter ranges or values for each test method used for a particular type of emission point tested.

(i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in ยง 63.2) required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, following the procedure specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
