###### Alternative effluent limitations or pretreatment standards

(b)mean effluent limitations determined on a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the CWA or pretreatment standards developed as local limits by the control authority under 40 CFR ยง 403.6(c) that apply to the discharge of wastewater subject to this provision. The permit writer (or control authority) will calculate these limitations or standards using a "building block" approach or the "combined wastestream formula." Under this approach, the permit writer (or control authority) will develop flow-weighted effluent limitations or standards for the treated combined wastestream by applying the limitations or standards in 40 CFR subchapter N that would otherwise apply to a particular wastestream received from off-site if the wastestream were treated and discharged from the facility at which it was generated.
