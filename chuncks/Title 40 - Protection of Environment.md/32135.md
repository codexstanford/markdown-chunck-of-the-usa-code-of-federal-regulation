####### Combined emission streams.

(b)When emissions of different kinds (e.g., emissions from continuous process vents, storage vessels, etc.) are combined at a new affected source, and at least one of the emission streams would be required by this subpart to apply controls in the absence of combination with other emission streams, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate.

(1) For any combined vent stream that includes one or more aggregate batch vent streams, comply with the provisions for aggregate batch vent streams.

(2) For any combined vent stream that does not include one or more aggregate batch vent streams:

(i) Reactor batch process vents and non-reactor batch process vents shall comply with the provisions for reactor batch process vents and non-reactor batch process vents, as appropriate.

(ii) The remaining emissions (i.e., storage vessel and/or continuous process vent emissions) included in the combined vent stream shall comply the provisions for storage vessels when storage vessel emissions are included and shall comply with the provisions for continuous process vents in the absence of storage vessel emissions (i.e., when only continuous process vents are included).
