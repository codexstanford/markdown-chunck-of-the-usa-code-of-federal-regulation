####### Engine cooling.

(a)Cool the engine during testing so its intake-air, oil, coolant, block, and head temperatures are within their expected ranges for normal operation. You may use auxiliary coolers and fans.

(1) For air-cooled engines only, if you use auxiliary fans you must account for work input to the fan(s) according to ยง 1065.110.

(2) See ยง 1065.125 for more information related to intake-air cooling.

(3) See ยง 1065.127 for more information related to exhaust gas recirculation cooling.

(4) Measure temperatures at the manufacturer-specified locations. If the manufacturer does not specify temperature measurement locations, then use good engineering judgment to monitor intake-air, oil, coolant, block, and head temperatures to ensure that they are in their expected ranges for normal operation.
