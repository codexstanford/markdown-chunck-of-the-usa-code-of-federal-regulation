######## Continuous emission monitoring system,CEMS

ormeans the equipment required under subpart H of this part to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings taken at least once every 15 minutes (using an automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS)), a permanent record of nitrogen oxides (NO) emissions, stack gas volumetric flow rate or stack gas moisture content (as applicable), in a manner consistent with part 75 of this chapter. The following are the principal types of continuous emission monitoring systems required under subpart H of this part:

(1) A flow monitoring system, consisting of a stack flow rate monitor and an automated DAHS. A flow monitoring system provides a permanent, continuous record of stack gas volumetric flow rate, in units of standard cubic feet per hour (scfh);

(2) A nitrogen oxides concentration monitoring system, consisting of a NOpollutant concentration monitor and an automated DAHS. A NOconcentration monitoring system provides a permanent, continuous record of NOemissions in units of parts per million (ppm);

(3) A nitrogen oxides emission rate (or NO-diluent) monitoring system, consisting of a NOpollutant concentration monitor, a diluent gas (COor O) monitor, and an automated DAHS. A NOconcentration monitoring system provides a permanent, continuous record of: NOconcentration in units of parts per million (ppm), diluent gas concentration in units of percent Oor CO(percent Oor CO), and NOemission rate in units of pounds per million British thermal units (lb/mmBtu); and

(4) A moisture monitoring system, as defined in ยง 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter. A moisture monitoring system provides a permanent, continuous record of the stack gas moisture content, in units of percent HO (percent HO).
