###### § 65.158 Performance test procedures for control devices.
####### General procedures.

(a)Where §§ 65.145 through 65.155 require, or the owner or operator elects to conduct, a performance test of a control device or a halogen reduction device, an owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of (a)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.

(1) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or halogen reduction device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or halogen reduction device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.

(2) Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this subpart, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of 40 CFR parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 unless the Administrator allows revisions to the test methods as specified in one or more of the following five paragraphs:

(i) The Administrator specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor or intermediate changes in methodology; or

(ii) The Administrator approves the use of a major change to a test method, the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific regulated source is in compliance; or

(iii) Intermediate and major changes to a test method shall be validated using the applicable procedures of Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63; or

(iv) The Administrator waives the requirement for the performance test as provided in § 65.157(b)(2) because the owner or operator of a regulated source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the regulated source is in compliance with the relevant standard; or

(v) The Administrator approves the use of an equivalent method.

(3) Each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, each run shall be conducted for at least 1 hour and under the conditions specified in this section. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the arithmetic mean of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.

(i) For control devices that are used to control emissions from high-throughput transfer racks, and that are capable of continuous vapor processing but do not handle continuous emissions or emissions from high-throughput transfer racks that load simultaneously from multiple loading arms, each run shall represent at least one complete tank truck or tank car loading period during which regulated materials are loaded, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.

(ii) For intermittent vapor processing systems used for controlling high-throughput transfer rack emissions that do not handle continuous emissions or multiple loading arms of a high-throughput transfer rack that load simultaneously, each run shall represent at least one complete control device cycle, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.
