###### ยง 180.607 Spiromesifen; tolerances for residues.
####### Indirect or inadvertent residues.

(d)Tolerances are established for the inadvertent or indirect residues of the insecticide/miticide spiromesifen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of spiromesifen [2-oxo-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-4-yl 3,3-dimethylbutanoate], 4-hydroxy-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-2-one, and its metabolites containing the 4-hydroxy-3-[4-(hydroxymethyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-2-one moiety, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spiromesifen, in the following rotational crop commodities:
