####### ยง 1065.365 Nonmethane cutter penetration fractions.
######## Measurement principles.,PF,PF

(b)A nonmethane cutter is a heated catalyst that removes nonmethane hydrocarbons from an exhaust sample stream before the FID analyzer measures the remaining hydrocarbon concentration. An ideal nonmethane cutter would have a CHpenetration fraction,, of 1.000, and the penetration fraction for all other nonmethane hydrocarbons would be 0.000, as represented by. The emission calculations in ยง 1065.660 use the measured values from this verification to account for less than ideal NMC performance.
