####### Raw materials preparation section

means the equipment at a polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of the standards in this subpart, this process section includes the equipment used to transfer raw materials from storage and/or the equipment used to transfer recovered material from the material recovery process sections to the raw material preparation section, and ends with the last piece of equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials preparation section may include equipment that is used to purify, dry, or otherwise treat raw materials or raw and recovered materials together; to activate catalysts; or to promote esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers). The raw materials preparation section does not include equipment that is designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw or recovered materials.
