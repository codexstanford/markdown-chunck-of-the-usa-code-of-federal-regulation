####### Periodic Reports.

(e)An owner or operator shall prepare Periodic Reports in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and submit them to the Administrator.

(1) An owner or operator shall submit Periodic Reports semiannually beginning 60 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period. The first report shall be submitted no later than 240 days after the date the Notification of Compliance Status Report is due and shall cover the 6-month period beginning on the date the Notification of Compliance Status Report is due.

(2) The owner or operator shall include the information specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (xiii) of this section, as applicable.

(i) The information required under § 63.10(e)(3). For the purposes of this subpart and the information required under § 63.10(e)(3), excursions (as defined in § 63.1283(d)(6)) shall be considered excess emissions.

(ii) A description of all excursions as defined in § 63.1283(d)(6) of this subpart that have occurred during the 6-month reporting period.

(A) For each excursion caused when the daily average value of a monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit), as specified in § 63.1283(d)(6)(i), the report must include the daily average values of the monitored parameter, the applicable operating parameter limit, and the date and duration of the period that the excursion occurred.

(B) For each excursion caused when the 30-day average condenser control efficiency is less than the value, as specified in § 63.1283(d)(6)(ii), the report must include the 30-day average values of the condenser control efficiency, and the date and duration of the period that the excursion occurred.

(C) For each excursion caused by lack of monitoring data, as specified in § 63.1283(d)(6)(iii), the report must include the date and duration of period when the monitoring data were not collected and the reason why the data were not collected.

(D) For each excursion caused when the maximum inlet gas flowrate identified under § 63.1282(g) is exceeded, the report must include the values of the inlet gas identified and the date and duration of the period that the excursion occurred.

(E) For each excursion caused when visible emissions determined under § 63.1282(h) exceed the maximum allowable duration, the report must include the date and duration of the period that the excursion occurred, repairs affected to the unit, and date the unit was returned to service.

(iii) For each inspection conducted in accordance with § 63.1283(c) during which a leak or defect is detected, the records specified in § 63.1284(b)(7) must be included in the next Periodic Report.

(iv) For each closed-vent system with a bypass line subject to § 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(A), records required under § 63.1284(b)(4)(iii) of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device through a bypass line. For each closed-vent system with a bypass line subject to § 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(B), records required under § 63.1284(b)(4)(iv) of all periods in which the seal or closure mechanism is broken, the bypass valve position has changed, or the key to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out.

(v) If an owner or operator elects to comply with § 63.1275(b)(1)(ii), the records required under § 63.1284(c)(3).

(vi) The information in paragraphs (e)(2)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section shall be stated in the Periodic Report, when applicable.

(A) No excursions.

(B) No continuous monitoring system has been inoperative, out of control, repaired, or adjusted.

(vii) Any change in compliance methods as specified in § 63.1282(e).

(viii) If the owner or operator elects to comply with § 63.1275(c)(2), the records required under § 63.1284(b)(10).

(ix) For flares, the records specified in § 63.1284(e).

(x) The results of any periodic test as required in § 63.1282(d)(3) conducted during the reporting period.

(xi) For each carbon adsorber used to meet the control device requirements of § 63.1281(d)(1), records of each carbon replacement that occurred during the reporting period.

(xii) For combustion control device inspections conducted in accordance with § 63.1283(b) the records specified in § 63.1284(h).

(xiii) Certification by a responsible official of truth, accuracy, and completeness. This certification shall state that, based on information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the statements and information in the document are true, accurate, and complete.
