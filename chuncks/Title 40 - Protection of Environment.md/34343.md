###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### § 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## No operating limit deviations.

(3)You are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) if the oxidizer is operated such that the average combustion temperature does not fall more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e)(3)(i) for each 3-hour period, or the catalytic oxidizer average combustion temperature does not fall more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e)(3)(ii) for each 3-hour period or the temperature difference across the bed does not fall more than 80 percent of the average temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e)(3)(ii) and the minimum temperature is always 50 degrees Fahrenheit above the catalyst's ignition temperature, and the capture system operating parameter is operated at an average value greater than or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.3350(f); and

(i) The overall organic HAP control efficiency is 95 percent or greater at an existing affected source and 98 percent or greater at a new affected source; or

(ii) The organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or

(iii) The organic HAP emission rate based on coating material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg coating material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg coating material applied at a new affected source; or

(iv) The organic HAP emitted during the month is less than the calculated allowable organic HAP as determined using paragraph (m) of this section.
