###### Area.

2.4.2.1.4Evaluate the area measure using the area of the source (or the area of the area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). Based on this area, designated as A, assign a value to the area measure as follows:

- For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for area using the appropriate Tier D equation of Table 2-5.

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value for area using the appropriate Tier D equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-subsurface intrusion component, assign a value based on the area of regularly occupied structures within the area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination using the Tier D equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).
