##### ยง 27.31 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the presiding officer and the Environmental Appeals Board, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.
