(3) You may limit the maximum speed ratio to a value below 0.95 if you have data showing this better represents in-use operation. You must use the step widths defined in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and include the upper limit as a test point. If you choose a value less than 0.60, you must test at least seven evenly distributed points between= 0 and your new upper speed ratio.

(d) Characterize the torque converter using the following procedure:

(1) Maintain ambient temperature between (15 and 35) &#xB0;C throughout testing. Measure ambient temperature within 1.0 m of the torque converter.

(2) Maintain transmission oil temperature as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. You may use an external transmission oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.

(3) Use good engineering judgment to warm up the torque converter according to the torque converter manufacturer's specifications.
