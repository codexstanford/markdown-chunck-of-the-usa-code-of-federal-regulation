7.1.10The temperature of the absorbing solution during sampling must be maintained at 15&#xB0; +/-10 &#xB0;C. As soon as possible following sampling and until analysis, the temperature of the collected sample must be maintained at 5&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;C. Where an extended period of time may elapse before the collected sample can be moved to the lower storage temperature, a collection temperature near the lower limit of the 15 +/-10 &#xB0;C range should be used to minimize losses during this period. Thermoelectric coolers specifically designed for this temperature control are available commercially and normally operate in the range of 5&#xB0; to 15 &#xB0;C. Small refrigerators can be modified to provide the required temperature control; however, inlet lines must be insulated from the lower temperatures to prevent condensation when sampling under humid conditions. A small heating pad may be necessary when sampling at low temperatures (<7 &#xB0;C) to prevent the absorbing solution from freezing.()
