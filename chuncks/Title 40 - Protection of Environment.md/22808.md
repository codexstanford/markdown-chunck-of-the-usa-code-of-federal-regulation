###### n,n

2.1 Each emission test shall consist ofruns (usually three) which produceemission rates. Thus two sets of emission rates are generated, one before and one after the change, the two sets being of equal size.

2.2 When using manual emission tests, except as provided in ยง 60.8(b) of this part, the reference methods of appendix A to this part shall be used in accordance with the procedures specified in the applicable subpart both before and after the change to obtain the data.

2.3 When using continuous monitors, the facility shall be operated as if a manual emission test were being performed. Valid data using the averaging time which would be required if a manual emission test were being conducted shall be used.

3.1 Subscripts a and b denote prechange and postchange respectively.

3.2 Calculate the arithmetic mean emission rate, E, for each set of data using Equation 1.
