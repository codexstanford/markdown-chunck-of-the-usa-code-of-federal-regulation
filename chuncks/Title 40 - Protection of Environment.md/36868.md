####### ยง 63.7575 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Rolling average

means the average of all data collected during the applicable averaging period. For demonstration of compliance with a CO CEMS-based emission limit based on CO concentration a 30-day (10-day) rolling average is comprised of the average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 720 (240) operating hours calculated each operating day. To demonstrate compliance on a 30-day rolling average basis for parameters other than CO, you must indicate the basis of the 30-day rolling average period you are using for compliance, as discussed in ยง 63.7545(e)(2)(iii). If you indicate the 30 operating day basis, you must calculate a new average value each operating day and shall include the measured hourly values for the preceding 30 operating days. If you select the 720 operating hours basis, you must average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 720 operating hours calculated each operating day.
