###### Continuous Sampling.

8.6.4In some cases it is possible to collect spectra continuously while the FTIR cell is purged with sample gas. The sample integration time, t, the sample flow rate through the gas cell, and the sample integration time must be chosen so that the collected data consist of at least 10 spectra with each spectrum being of a separate cell volume of flue gas. Sampling in this manner may only be performed if the native source analyte concentrations do not affect the test results.
