() Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph IV.K.10(ii) of this Ruling, the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the reviewing authority) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph IV.K.10(v) of this Ruling, such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted.
