(iii) A copy of any exception reports and a copy of each confirmation of receipt (movement document) sent by the foreign receiving facility to the exporter for at least three (3) years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter; and

(iv) A copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal sent by the foreign receiving facility to the exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that the foreign receiving facility completed interim or final processing of the hazardous waste shipment.

(v) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per ยง 262.85 for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.

(2) Exporters may satisfy these recordkeeping requirements by retaining electronically submitted documents in the exporter's account on EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector. No exporter may be held liable for the inability to produce such documents for inspection under this section if the exporter can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system for which the exporter bears no responsibility.

(3) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.
