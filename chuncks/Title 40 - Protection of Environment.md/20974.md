###### Definitions
####### ยง 60.4248 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Date of manufacture

means one of the following things:

(1) For freshly manufactured engines and modified engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine is originally produced.

(2) For reconstructed engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine was originally produced, except as specified in paragraph (3) of this definition.

(3) Reconstructed engines are assigned a new date of manufacture if the fixed capital cost of the new and refurbished components exceeds 75 percent of the fixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new facility. An engine that is produced from a previously used engine block does not retain the date of manufacture of the engine in which the engine block was previously used if the engine is produced using all new components except for the engine block. In these cases, the date of manufacture is the date of reconstruction or the date the new engine is produced.
