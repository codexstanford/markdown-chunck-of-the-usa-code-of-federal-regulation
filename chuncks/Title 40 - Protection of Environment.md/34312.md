####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Each coating material as-applied meets the mass fraction of coating solids standard (ยง 63.3320(b)(3)).

(2)You must demonstrate that each coating material applied at an existing affected source contains no more than 0.20 kg of organic HAP per kg of coating solids applied and each coating material applied at a new affected source contains no more than 0.08 kg of organic HAP per kg of coating solids applied. You must demonstrate compliance in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) Determine the as-applied coating solids content of each coating material following the procedure in ยง 63.3360(d). You must calculate the as-applied coating solids content of coating materials which are reduced, thinned, or diluted prior to application, using Equation 6:

(ii) Calculate the as-applied organic HAP to coating solids ratio using Equation 7:
