###### ยง 180.479 Halosulfuron-methyl; tolerances for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide halosulfuron-methyl, methyl 5-[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidiny)amino] carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only those halosulfuron-methyl residues containing the 3-chlorosulfonamide (3-CSA) moiety, expressed as the stoichiometric equivalent of halosulfuron-methyl, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide halosulfuron-methyl, methyl 5-[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidiny)amino]carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only halosulfuron-methyl.
