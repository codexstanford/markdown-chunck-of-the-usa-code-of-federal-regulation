####### Test Procedure and Criteria

1.

a. Measure the flow of the PCV valve in standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) vs. pressure differential across the valve over a range of operating pressures from 4-22 inches Hg., at standard atmospheric conditions (21.1 &#xB0;C (70 &#xB0;F) at 755mm (29.92 inches).

b. A PCV valve shall flow within the vehicle manufacturer's specifications or shall meet the following criteria: Whenever the mean of the original equipment flow curve is below 1 SCFM, a maximum deviation of the mean replacement PCV valve shall not exceed +/-0.1 SCFM. Whenever the mean original equipment curve is equal to or greater than 1 SCFM, a maximum deviation of the mean of the replacement PCV valve shall not exceed +/-10%. The total flow tolerance of the replacement valve shall not exceed the original equipment variation from the mean, at any pressure differential.
