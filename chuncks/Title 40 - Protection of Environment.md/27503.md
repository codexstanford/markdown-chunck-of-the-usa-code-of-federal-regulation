####### Affected sources,Off-site material management units.

(c)-(1)For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of off-site material management units associated with the operation. An off-site material management unit is a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system used to manage off-site material. For the purpose of implementing the standards under this subpart, a unit that meets the definition of a tank or container but also is equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent for any of the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section is not an off-site material management unit but instead is a process vent and is to be included in the appropriate affected source group under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Examples of such a unit may include, but are not limited to, a distillate receiver vessel, a primary condenser, a bottoms receiver vessel, a surge control tank, a separator tank, and a hot well.
