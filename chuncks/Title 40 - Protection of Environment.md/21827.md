######## e.g.,,i.e.,

(1) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on an output basis (lb of COper gross or net MWh of energy output), you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record the hourly gross electric output or net electric output, as applicable, from the affected EGU(s). These measurements must be performed using 0.2 class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI Standards No. C12.20 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 60.17). For a combined heat and power (CHP) EGU, as defined in ยง 60.5580, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously (hour-by-hour) determine and record the total useful thermal output. For process steam applications, you will need to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously determine and record the hourly steam flow rate, temperature, and pressure. Your plan shall ensure that you install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to record each component of the determination, hour-by-hour.
