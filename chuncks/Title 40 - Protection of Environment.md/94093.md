####### Servicing restrictions.

(2)(i) If the coil is removed from the casing of a railroad transformer (e.g., the transformer is rebuilt), after January 1, 1982, the railroad transformer may not be refilled with dielectric fluid containing a PCB concentration greater than 50 ppm;

(ii) After January 1, 1984, railroad transformers may only be serviced with dielectric fluid containing less than 1000 ppm PCB, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;

(iii) Dielectric fluid may be filtered through activated carbon or otherwise industrially processed for the purpose of reducing the PCB concentration in the fluid;

(iv) Any PCB dielectric fluid that is used to service PCB railroad transformers must be stored in accordance with the storage for disposal requirements of ยง 761.65;

(v) After July 1, 1979, processing and distribution in commerce of PCBs for purposes of servicing railroad transformers is permitted only for persons who are granted an exemption under TSCA section 6(e)(3)(B).

(vi) A PCB Transformer may be converted to a PCB-Contaminated Transformer or to a non-PCB Transformer by draining, refilling, and/or otherwise servicing the railroad transformer. In order to reclassify, the railroad transformer's dielectric fluid must contain less than 500 ppm (for conversion to PCB-Contaminated Transformer) or less than 50 ppm PCB (for conversion to a non-PCB Transformer) after a minimum of three months of inservice use subsequent to the last servicing conducted for the purpose of reducing the PCB concentration in the transformer.
