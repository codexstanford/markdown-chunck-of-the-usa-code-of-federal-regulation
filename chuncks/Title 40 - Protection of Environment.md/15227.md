(i)Wisconsin Administrative Order AM-16-01, issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources on January 31, 2017, to USG Interiors LLC for its facility located in Walworth, Wisconsin.

(137) On May 16, 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to revise Wisconsin's air permitting rules NR 400.02(136m), NR 406.04(1)(w), NR 406.08(1), NR 406.10 and NR 406.11(1).

Wisconsin has also requested to remove from the SIP NR 406.16(2)(d) and NR 406.17(3)(e), provisions affecting eligibility of coverage under general and registration construction permits, previously approved in paragraph (c)(113) of this section. This action ensures consistency with Wisconsin Environmental Protection Act (WEPA) laws.
