(C)The manufacturer must perform a separate test for each malfunction limit established by the manufacturer for the EGR system parameters (e.g., low flow, high flow, slow response) specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(C) and in (g)(3)(ii)(E) of this section. In conducting the EGR system slow response demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the EGR system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.
