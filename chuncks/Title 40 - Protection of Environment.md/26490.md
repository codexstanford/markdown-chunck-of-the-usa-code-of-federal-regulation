####### Continuous web cleaning machine

means a solvent cleaning machine in which parts such as film, coils, wire, and metal strips are cleaned at speeds typically in excess of 11 feet per minute. Parts are generally uncoiled, cleaned such that the same part is simultaneously entering and exiting the solvent application area of the solvent cleaning machine, and then recoiled or cut. For the purposes of this subpart, all continuous web cleaning machines are considered to be a subset of in-line solvent cleaning machines.
