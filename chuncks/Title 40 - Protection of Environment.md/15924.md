####### § 53.66 Test procedure: Volatility test.
######## Aerosol monitoring equipment.

(3)The evaporation and condensation dynamics of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon the vapor pressure of the volatile component in the carrier gas. The size of an aerosol becomes fixed only when an equilibrium is established between the aerosol and the surrounding vapor; therefore, aerosol size measurement shall be used as a surrogate measure of this equilibrium. A suitable instrument with a range of 0.3 to 10 µm, an accuracy of 0.5 µm, and a resolution of 0.2 µm (e.g., an optical particle sizer, or a time-of-flight instrument) shall be used for this purpose. The parameter monitored for stability shall be the mass median instrument measured diameter (i.e. optical diameter if an optical particle counter is used). A stable aerosol shall be defined as an aerosol with a mass median diameter that has changed less than 0.25 µm over a 4 hour time period.
