####### Test site.

(b)(1) The measurement area within the test site must meet the following requirements and be laid out as described:

(i) The following points must be established:

(A) Microphone target point-a reference point on the vehicle path;

(B) End point-a point on the vehicle path 7.5 +/-0.3m (24.6 +/-1.0 ft) beyond the microphone target point, and

(C) Microphone location point-a point 15 +/-0.3m (49.2 +/-1.0 ft) from the microphone target point on a normal to the vehicle path through the microphone target point.

(ii) The microphone must be:

(A) Positioned at the microphone location point 1.2 +/-0.1 m (3.9 +/-0.3 ft) above the ground plane; and

(B) Oriented in a plane perpendicular to the vehicle path, and at an angle for which the microphone was calibrated to have the flatest response characteristics over the frequency range of 100 Hz to 10,000 Hz when measured with respect to the motorcycle source.

(iii) The surface of the ground within at least the triangular area formed by the microphone location and the points 15 +/-0.3m (49.2 +/-1.0 ft.) prior to and 15 +/-0.3 m (49.2 +/-1.0 ft.) beyond the microphone target point must be flat (+5 cm (2.0 in)) and level (grade not more than 0.5% along vehicle path), have a concrete or sealed asphalt surface, and be free from snow, soil or other extraneous material.

(iv) The vehicle path must be relatively smooth and of sufficient length for safe acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the motorcycle.

(2) The test site must be flat, open space free of large sound-reflecting surfaces (other than the ground), such as parked vehicles, sign-boards, buildings or hillsides located within a 30 +/-0.3 m (98.4 +/-1.0 ft) radius of the microphone location and the following points on the vehicle path (see Figure 1):

(i) The microphone location point;

(ii) A point 15 +/-0.3 m (49.2 +/-1.0 ft.) before the microphone target point; and

(iii) A point 15 +/-0.3 m (49.2 +/-1.0 ft) beyond the microphone target point.
