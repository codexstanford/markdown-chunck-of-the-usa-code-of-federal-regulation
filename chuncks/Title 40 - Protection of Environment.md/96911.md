()The test should be designed to have a predetermined sensitivity and power. The number of cells, cultures, and concentrations of test substance used should reflect these defined parameters. The number of cells per culture is based on the expected background mutant frequency; a general guide is to use a number which is 10 times the inverse of this frequency. Several concentrations (usually at least four) of the test substance shall be used. These shall yield a concentration-related toxic effect. The highest concentration shall produce a low level of survival (approximately 10 percent), and the survival in the lowest concentration shall approximate that of the negative control. Cytotoxicity shall be determined after treatment with the test substance both in the presence and in the absence of the metabolic activation system.
