###### ยง 1051.120 What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?
####### Warranty period.

(b)Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least 50 percent of the vehicle's minimum useful life in kilometers or hours of engine operation (where applicable), or at least 30 months, whichever comes first. You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the engine may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for the engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component. If a vehicle has no odometer, base warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the vehicle's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service.
