######## i.e.,

(D) Facilities with CCR surface impoundments located on properties adjacent to a water body must demonstrate that there is no reasonable probability that a complete and direct transport pathway (not mediated by groundwater) can exist between the impoundment and any nearby water body. If the potential for such a pathway is identified, then the unit would not be eligible to submit a demonstration. If ongoing releases are identified, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must address these releases in accordance with ยง 257.96(a); and

(E) Upon submission of the application and any supplemental materials submitted in support of the application to the Administrator or the Participating State Director, the owner or operator must place the complete application in the facility's operating record as required by ยง 257.105(f)(14).
