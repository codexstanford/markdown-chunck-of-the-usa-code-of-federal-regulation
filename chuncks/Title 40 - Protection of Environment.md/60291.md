###### § 180.3 Tolerances for related pesticide chemicals.

(a) Pesticide chemicals that cause related pharmacological effects will be regarded, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as having an additive deleterious action. (For example, many pesticide chemicals within each of the following groups have related pharmacological effects: Chlorinated organic pesticides, arsenic-containing chemicals, metallic dithiocarbamates, cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides.)

(b) Tolerances established for such related pesticide chemicals may limit the amount of a common component (such as AsO) that may be present, or may limit the amount of biological activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) that may be present, or may limit the total amount of related pesticide chemicals (such as chlorinated organic pesticides) that may be present.

(c)(1) Where tolerances for inorganic bromide in or on the same raw agricultural commodity are set in two or more sections in this part (example: §§ 180.123 and 180.199), the overall quantity of inorganic bromide to be tolerated from use of the same pesticide in different modes of application or from two or more pesticide chemicals for which tolerances are established is the highest of the separate applicable tolerances. For example, where the bromide tolerance on asparagus from methyl bromide commodity fumigation is 100 parts per million (40 CFR 180.123) and on asparagus from methyl bromide soil treatment is 300 parts per million (40 CFR 180.199), the overall inorganic bromide tolerance for asparagus grown on methyl bromide-treated soil and also fumigated with methyl bromide after harvest is 300 parts per million.

(2) Where tolerances are established in terms of inorganic bromide residues only from use of organic bromide fumigants on raw agricutural commodities, such tolerances are sufficient to protect the public health, and no additional concurrent tolerances for the organic pesticide chemicals from such use are necessary. This conclusion is based on evidence of the dissipation of the organic pesticide or its conversion to inorganic bromide residues in the food when ready to eat.

(d)(1) Where tolerances are established for both calcium cyanide and hydrogen cyanide on the same raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such pesticides shall not yield more residue than that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances, calculated as hydrogen cyanide.
