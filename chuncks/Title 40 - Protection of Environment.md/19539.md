####### Closed vent system

means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission source to a control device. If gas or vapor from regulated equipment are routed to a process (e.g., to a petroleum refinery fuel gas system), the process shall not be considered a closed vent system and is not subject to the closed vent system standards.
