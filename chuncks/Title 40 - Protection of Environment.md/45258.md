7.4.1.3This is applicable for equipment having at least one designated refrigerant (Section 11.2) with a boiling point between -50 &#xB0;C and +10 &#xB0;C. Measure the rate for R-22, or the refrigerant with the lowest boiling point if R-22 is not a designated refrigerant. Repeat the test in Section 7.4.1.2 at saturated conditions at 40 &#xB0;C and continue to operate equipment to assure it will operate at this condition (see Section 7.4.3). At initial conditions, the recovery cylinder shall be at saturated pressure at 40 &#xB0;C.
