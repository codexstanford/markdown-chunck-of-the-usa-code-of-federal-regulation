####### Evaluation of study results.

(2)The findings of an immunotoxicity study shall be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of other toxic effects. The evaluation shall include the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or absence, and the incidence and severity of abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted test shall provide a satisfactory estimation of a no-observed-effect level. It may indicate the need for an additional study and provide information on the selection of dose levels.
