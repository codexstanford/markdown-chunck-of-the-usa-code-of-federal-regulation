11.3.4 Offtake Systems Observations. To perform a test run, traverse the battery as in Section 11.3.3.1. Look ahead and back two to four ovens to get a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven. Consider visible emissions from the following points as offtake system VE: (a) the flange between the gooseneck and collecting main ("saddle"), (b) the junction point of the standpipe and oven ("standpipe base"), (c) the other parts of the offtake system (the standpipe cap), and (d) the junction points with ovens and flanges of jumper pipes.

11.3.4.1 Do not stray from the traverse line in order to get a "closer look" at any part of the offtake system unless it is to distinguish leaks from interferences from other sources or to avoid obstacles.
