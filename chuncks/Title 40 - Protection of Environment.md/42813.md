###### § 75.68 Temporary modifications to otherwise applicable quality-assurance requirements during the COVID-19 national emergency.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, during and following the emergency period defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the provisions of this section shall apply for purposes of reporting the data that are required to be reported under this part and completing the tests that are required to be completed under this part.

(1) For purposes of this section, the emergency period begins on March 13, 2020, the date of the declaration of a national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak by the President of the United States in accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1621, and concludes 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency by Congress or the President in accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1622, provided that the emergency period under this section shall not extend past the expiration of the effectiveness of this section.

(2) The provisions of this section shall apply with respect to the following tests that are required to be completed under this part:

(i) Any quality-assurance test of a continuous emission monitoring system required under appendix B to this part or § 75.74(c).

(ii) Any quality-assurance test of a fuel flowmeter required under section 2.1.6 of appendix D to this part or § 75.74(c).

(iii) Any certification or recertification test of a continuous emission monitoring system required under § 75.20 or § 75.70(d).

(iv) Any certification test of a fuel flowmeter required under section 2.1.5 of appendix D to this part or § 75.70(d).

(v) Any periodic analysis of fuel sulfur content, density, or gross calorific value required under section 2.2 or 2.3 of appendix D to this part, provided that there have been no changes in the fuel supply since the most recent previous fuel analysis that would reasonably be expected to cause a change in such fuel characteristics.

(vi) Any periodic retest of NOemission rates required under section 2.2 of appendix E to this part.

(vii) Any periodic retest of fuel-and-unit-specific NOemission rates required under § 75.19(c)(4)(i)(D) that is required only because of the passage of time and not because of changes in the fuel supply, physical changes to the unit, changes in the manner of unit operation, or changes to the emission controls.

(3) Following a failure to complete by the applicable deadline (or by the end of any grace period following the deadline) any required quality-assurance test or tests described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section for any continuous emission monitoring system or fuel flowmeter under this part, for any subsequent operating hour in the emergency period prior to completion of the test or tests in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit may continue to report data determined using measurements obtained from the continuous emission monitoring system or fuel flowmeter as valid, provided that the following conditions are met:

(i) But for the failure to complete the quality-assurance test or tests, the data obtained from the monitoring system would be considered valid without the benefit of the provisions of this section;

(ii) The reason for failure to complete each such quality-assurance test is travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the COVID-19 national emergency; and

(iii) The owner or operator creates and maintains the records specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and the designated representative submits the notifications required under paragraphs (a)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(4) Following a failure to complete by the applicable deadline any required certification or recertification test or tests described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section for any continuous emission monitoring system or fuel flowmeter under this part, for any subsequent operating hour in an emergency period prior to completion of the test or tests in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit may continue to report data determined using measurements obtained from the continuous emission monitoring system or fuel flowmeter as conditionally valid provided that the following conditions are met:

(i) But for the failure to complete the certification or recertification test or tests, the data obtained from the monitoring system would be considered conditionally valid without the benefit of the provisions of this section;

(ii) The reason for failure to complete each such certification or recertification test is travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the COVID-19 national emergency; and

(iii) The owner or operator creates and maintains the records specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and the designated representative submits the notifications required under paragraphs (a)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(5) Following a failure to complete by the applicable deadline any required periodic analysis of fuel characteristics under appendix D to this part described in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section or any required periodic NOemission rate testing under appendix E to this part or § 75.19 described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) or (vii) of this section, for any subsequent operating hour during the emergency period prior to completion of the analysis or testing in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit using the methodology in appendix D may continue to report data determined using the fuel characteristics authorized for use under the regulations following the most recent previous analysis for that fuel, the owner or operator of an affected unit using the methodology in appendix E may continue to report data determined using the correlation curve developed from the most recent previous appendix E NOemission rate testing, and the owner or operator of an affected unit using a fuel-and-unit-specific emission rate under the LME methodology in § 75.19(c)(1)(iv) may continue to report data determined using the fuel-and-unit-specific emission rate developed from the most recent previous LME NOemission rate testing, provided that the following conditions are met:

(i) But for the failure to complete the appendix D fuel analysis or the appendix E or LME NOemission rate testing, the data obtained from the appendix D, appendix E, or LME monitoring methodology would be considered valid without the benefit of the provisions of this section;

(ii) The reason for failure to complete each such appendix D fuel analysis or appendix E or LME NOemission rate test is travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the COVID-19 national emergency; and

(iii) The owner or operator creates and maintains the records specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and the designated representative submits the notifications required under paragraphs (a)(7)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

(6)(i) Each quality-assurance test, certification or recertification test, appendix D fuel analysis, and appendix E or LME NOemission rate test required under this part that was not completed for a unit by the applicable deadline (or by the end of any grace period following the deadline) must be completed as soon as practicable following the end of travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the COVID-19 national emergency that affect that unit or the personnel or supplies required to complete the analysis or testing for that unit, but in no event later than the conclusion of the emergency period as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) If a test or analysis for which a deadline is established under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section is not completed by that deadline, the test or analysis shall be completed as soon as practicable thereafter, and for each operating hour following that deadline until completion of the test or analysis, the owner or operator shall report substitute data as if the originally applicable deadline for the test or analysis were the deadline under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.

(iii) For purposes of determining the applicable deadline for the next quality-assurance test, appendix D fuel analysis, or appendix E or LME NOemission rate test required under this part after a delayed quality-assurance test, appendix D fuel analysis, or appendix E or LME NOemission rate test is completed or due to be completed in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, the delayed test or analysis shall be considered to have been completed in a timely manner as of the date on which such delayed test or analysis was actually completed or, if earlier, the deadline for completion of the delayed test or analysis under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.

(7) The following recordkeeping and reporting requirements shall apply to any use of the procedures under paragraphs (a)(3) through (6) of this section:

(i) The owner or operator of an affected unit reporting data under paragraph (a)(3), (4), or (5) of this section shall maintain records documenting the reasons for failure to complete by the applicable deadline each test or analysis referenced in such paragraph and demonstrating that such failure is caused by travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the COVID-19 national emergency. The owner or operator shall also maintain records documenting when any such travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions impairing the ability to complete testing or analyses for that unit ceased to apply. The records shall be maintained on site at the source in a form suitable for inspection for a period of three years from the date of each record.
