###### Spectral Interference.

4.1.2This results from the presence of interfering compound(s) (interferant) in the sample. Interferant spectral features overlap analyte spectral features. Any compound with an infrared spectrum, including analytes, can potentially be an interferant. The Protocol measures absorbance band overlap in each analytical region to determine if potential interferants shall be classified as known interferants (FTIR Protocol, section 4.9 and appendix B). Water vapor and COare common spectral interferants. Both of these compounds have strong infrared spectra and are present in many sample matrices at high concentrations relative to analytes. The extent of interference depends on the (1) interferant concentration, (2) analyte concentration, and (3) the degree of band overlap. Choosing an alternate analytical region can minimize or avoid the spectral interference. For example, COinterferes with the analysis of the 670 cmbenzene band. However, benzene can also be measured near 3000 cm(with less sensitivity).
