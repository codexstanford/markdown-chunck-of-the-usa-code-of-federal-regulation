###### ยง 86.523-78 Oxides of nitrogen analyzer calibration.
####### Initial and periodic calibration.

(b)Prior to its introduction into service and monthly thereafter, if oxides of nitrogen are measured, the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:

(1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.

(2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero grade air or zero grade nitrogen.

(3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO in Ncalibration gases with nominal concentrations of 50 and 100 percent of that range. Additional calibration points may be generated.

(c) When testing methanol-fueled motorcycles, it may be necessary to clean the analyzer frequently to prevent interference with NOmeasurements (see EPA/600/S3-88/040).
