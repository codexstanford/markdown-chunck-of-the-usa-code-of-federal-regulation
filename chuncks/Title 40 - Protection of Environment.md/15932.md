######## Dynamic conditioning of filters.

(2)Total dynamic conditioning is required prior to the initial weight determined in phase A. Dynamic conditioning refers to pulling clean air from the clean air generation system through the filters. Total dynamic conditioning can be established by sequential filter weighing every 30 minutes following repetitive dynamic conditioning. The filters are considered sufficiently conditioned if the sequential weights are repeatable to +/-3 µg.
