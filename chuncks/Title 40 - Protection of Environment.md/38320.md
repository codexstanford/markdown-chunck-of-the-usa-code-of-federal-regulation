####### Span Value.

3.2.1.4.2To determine the span value of the Hg CEMS, multiply the Hg concentration corresponding to the applicable emissions standard by two. If the result of this calculation is an exact multiple of 10 µg/scm, use the result as the span value. Otherwise, round off the result to either: the next highest integer; the next highest multiple of 5 µg/scm; or the next highest multiple of 10 µg/scm.
