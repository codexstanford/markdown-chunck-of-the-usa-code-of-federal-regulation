######### Unit with a main stack and a bypass stack.

(c)Whenever any portion of the flue gases from an affected unit can be routed through a bypass stack to avoid the installed NO-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system or NOconcentration monitoring system, the owner and operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain separate NO-diluent continuous emissions monitoring systems and flow monitoring systems on the main stack and the bypass stack and calculate NOmass emissions for the unit as the sum of the NOmass emissions measured at the two stacks;

(2) Monitor NOmass emissions at the main stack using a NO-diluent CEMS and a flow monitoring system and measure NOmass emissions at the bypass stack using the reference methods in § 75.22(b) for NOconcentration, flow rate, and diluent gas concentration, or NOconcentration and flow rate, and calculate NOmass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions recorded by the installed monitoring systems on the main stack and the emissions measured by the reference method monitoring systems; or

(3) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent CEMS and a flow monitoring system only on the main stack. If this option is chosen, it is not necessary to designate the exhaust configuration as a multiple stack configuration in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53, since only the main stack is monitored. For each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used and the emissions are either uncontrolled (or the add-on controls are not documented to be operating properly), report NOmass emissions as follows. If the unit heat input is determined using a flow monitor and a diluent monitor, report NOmass emissions using the maximum potential NOemission rate, the maximum potential flow rate, and either the maximum potential COconcentration or the minimum potential Oconcentration (as applicable). The maximum potential NOemission rate may be specific to the type of fuel combusted in the unit during the bypass (see § 75.33(c)(8)). If the unit heat input is determined using a fuel flowmeter, in accordance with appendix D to this part, report NOmass emissions as the product of the maximum potential NOemission rate and the actual measured hourly heat input rate. Alternatively, for a unit with NOadd-on emission controls, for each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used but the add-on NOemission controls are not bypassed, the owner or operator may report the maximum controlled NOemission rate (MCR) instead of the maximum potential NOemission rate provided that the add-on controls are documented to be operating properly, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit, required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall record parametric data to verify the proper operation of the NOadd-on emission controls as described in § 75.34(d). Furthermore, the owner or operator shall calculate the MCR using the procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part by replacing the words "maximum potential NOemission rate (MER)" with the words "maximum controlled NOemission rate (MCR)" and by using the NOMEC in the calculations instead of the NOMPC.
