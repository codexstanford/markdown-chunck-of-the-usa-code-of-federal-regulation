####### General.,H,N,N,H,N,N

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of saflufenacil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of saflufenacil, 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1(2)-pyrimidinyl]-4-fluoro--[[methyl(1-methylethyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzamide, and its metabolites-[2-chloro-5-(2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydro-1(2)-pyrimidinyl)-4-fluorobenzoyl]-&#x2032;-isopropylsulfamide and-[4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-({[(isopropylamino)sulfonyl]amino}carbonyl)phenyl]urea, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of saflufenacil, in or on the commodities.
