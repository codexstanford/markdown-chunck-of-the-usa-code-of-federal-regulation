####### Chromium anodizing

means the electrolytic process by which an oxide layer is produced on the surface of a base metal for functional purposes (e.g., corrosion resistance or electrical insulation) using a chromic acid solution. In chromium anodizing, the part to be anodized acts as the anode in the electrical circuit, and the chromic acid solution, with a concentration typically ranging from 50 to 100 grams per liter (g/L), serves as the electrolyte.
