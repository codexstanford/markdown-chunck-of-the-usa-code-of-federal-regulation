###### § 60.560 Applicability and designation of affected facilities.
####### Poly(ethylene terephthalate).

(3)The applicability date for each poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected facility is September 30, 1987.

(c) Any facility under paragraph (a) of this section that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after its applicability date as identified under paragraph (b) of this section is subject to the requirements of this subpart, except as provided in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.

(d) Any polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility with a September 30, 1987, applicability date that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 30, 1987, and on or before January 10, 1989, with an uncontrolled emission rate (as defined in footnote a to table 2) at or below those identified in table 2 is not subject to the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate exceeds that rate listed for it in table 2 or it is modified or reconstructed after January 10, 1989. At such time, such facility becomes subject to § 60.562-1 and the procedures identified in § 60.562-1(a) shall be used to determine the control of emissions from the facility.

(e)(1) Modified or reconstructed affected facilities at polystyrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants with uncontrolled emission rates at or below those identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate exceeds that rate listed for it in table 2. This exemption does not apply to new polystyrene or poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected facilities.

(2) Emissions from modified or reconstructed affected facilities that are controlled by an existing control device and that have uncontrolled emission rates greater than the uncontrolled threshold emission rates identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until the existing control device is modified, reconstructed, or replaced.

(f) No process section of an experimental process line is considered an affected facility for continuous or intermittent process emissions.

(g) Individual vent streams that emit continuous emissions with uncontrolled annual emissions of less than 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or with a weight percent TOC of less than 0.10 percent from a new, modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(1). If at a later date, an individual stream's uncontrolled annual emissions become 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or greater (if the stream was exempted on the basis of the uncontrolled annual emissions exemption) or VOC concentration becomes 0.10 weight percent or higher (if the stream was exempted on the basis of the VOC concentration exemption), then the stream is subject to the requirements of § 60.562-1.

(h) Emergency vent streams, as defined in § 60.561, from a new, modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(2).

(i) An owner or operator of a polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 30, 1987, and on or before January 10, 1989, and that is in a process line in which more than one type of polyolefin (i.e., polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, or their copolymers) is produced shall select one of the polymer/production process combinations in table 1 for purposes of determining applicable affected facilities and uncontrolled threshold emissions rates.
