####### Mass rate calculation.

(H)The mass rate of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP for each sample run shall be calculated using the following equations. Where the mass rate of TOC is being calculated, all organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) measured by methods specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section are summed using Equations 52 and 53 of this subpart. Where the mass rate of total organic HAP is being calculated, only soluble and partially soluble HAP compounds shall be summed using Equations 52 and 53.
