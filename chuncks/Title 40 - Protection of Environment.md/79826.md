(iv)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), (c)(4), (where N = 80). However, contrary to ยง 721.91(a)(4), if the waste stream containing the PMN substance will be treated using biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification, then the amount of PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 75 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.
