(ii)These shall be tabulated and presented with mean values and a measure of variability (e.g., standard deviation) and shall include:

(A) Airflow rates through the inhalation equipment.

(B) Temperature of air.

(C) Nominal concentration-total amount of test substance fed into the inhalation equipment divided by volume of air (no standard deviation).

(D) Measured total concentrations (particulate and/or gaseous phases) in test breathing zone.

(E) Particle size distribution (e.g., median aerodynamic diameter of particles with geometric standard deviation) including estimates of the percents of inhalable and non-inhalable portions for the test animals.
