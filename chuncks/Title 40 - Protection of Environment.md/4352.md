2.1 An air sampler, properly located at the measurement site, draws a measured quantity of ambient air into a covered housing and through a filter during a 24-hr (nominal) sampling period. The sampler flow rate and the geometry of the shelter favor the collection of particles up to 25-50 µm (aerodynamic diameter), depending on wind speed and direction.() The filters used are specified to have a minimum collection efficiency of 99 percent for 0.3 µm (DOP) particles (see Section 7.1.4).

2.2 The filter is weighed (after moisture equilibration) before and after use to determine the net weight (mass) gain. The total volume of air sampled, corrected to EPA standard conditions (25 &#xB0;C, 760 mm Hg [101 kPa]), is determined from the measured flow rate and the sampling time. The concentration of total suspended particulate matter in the ambient air is computed as the mass of collected particles divided by the volume of air sampled, corrected to standard conditions, and is expressed in micrograms per standard cubic meter (µg/std m). For samples collected at temperatures and pressures significantly different than standard conditions, these corrected concentrations may differ substantially from actual concentrations (micrograms per actual cubic meter), particularly at high elevations. The actual particulate matter concentration can be calculated from the corrected concentration using the actual temperature and pressure during the sampling period.
