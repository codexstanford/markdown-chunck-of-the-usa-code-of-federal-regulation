####### Audits with reference method samplers to determine system accuracy and bias.

4.3According to the schedule and procedure specified in part 58, appendix A of this chapter, a reference method sampler is required to be located at each of selected PMSLAMS sites as a duplicate sampler. The results from the primary sampler and the duplicate reference method sampler are used to calculate accuracy of the primary sampler on a quarterly basis, bias of the primary sampler on an annual basis, and bias of a single reporting organization on an annual basis. Reference 2 in section 13.0 of this appendix provides additional information and guidance on these reference method audits.
