####### Operating requirements.

(a)Operating requirements prescribed shall, at a minimum, specify that:

(1) Except during well stimulation injection pressure at the wellhead shall be calculated so as to assure that the pressure in the injection zone during injection does not initiate new fractures or propagate existing fractures in the injection zone. In no case, shall injection pressure initiate fractures in the confining zone or cause the migration of injection or formation fluids into an underground source of drinking water.

(2) Injection between the outermost casing protecting underground sources of drinking water and the well bore is prohibited.
