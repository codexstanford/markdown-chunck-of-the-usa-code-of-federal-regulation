() For purposes of this section, a WMPP opportunity is feasible if the Sistersville Plant considers it to be technically feasible (taking into account engineering and regulatory factors, product line specifications and customer needs) and economically practical (taking into account the full environmental costs and benefits associated with the WMPP opportunity and the company's internal requirements for approval of capital projects). For purposes of the WMPP Project, the Sistersville Plant shall use "An Introduction to Environmental Accounting as a Business Management Tool," (EPA 742/R-95/001) as one tool to identify the full environmental costs and benefits of each WMPP opportunity.
