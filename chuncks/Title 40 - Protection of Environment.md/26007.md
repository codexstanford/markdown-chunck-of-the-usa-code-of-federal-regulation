####### Polycarbonates

means a special class of polyester formed from any dihydroxy compound and any carbonate diester or by ester interchange. Polycarbonates may be produced by solution or emulsion polymerization, although other methods may be used. A typical method for the manufacture of polycarbonates includes the reaction of bisphenol-A with phosgene in the presence of pyridine to form a polycarbonate. Methylene chloride is used as a solvent in this polymerization reaction.
