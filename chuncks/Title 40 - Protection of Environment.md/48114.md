######## Calculating fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions for passenger automobiles and light trucks.

(i)(1) Manufacturers must compute separate production-weighted fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions at the end of the model year for passenger automobiles and light trucks, using actual production, where production means vehicles produced and delivered for sale, and certifying model types to standards as defined in § 86.1818-12. The model type carbon-related exhaust emission results determined according to 40 CFR part 600, subpart F (in units of grams per mile rounded to the nearest whole number) become the certification standard for each model type.

(2) Manufacturers must separately calculate production-weighted fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions levels for the following averaging sets according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 600, subpart F:

(i) Passenger automobiles subject to the fleet average COstandards specified in § 86.1818-12(c)(2);

(ii) Light trucks subject to the fleet average COstandards specified in § 86.1818-12(c)(3);

(iii) Passenger automobiles subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in § 86.1818-12(e), if applicable; and

(iv) Light trucks subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in § 86.1818-12(e), if applicable.
