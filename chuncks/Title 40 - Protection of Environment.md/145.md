(c)EPA may disclose business information to another Federal agency if-

(2) The request, if any, sets forth the official purpose for which the information is needed;

(3) When the information has been claimed as confidential or has been determined to be confidential, the responsible EPA office provides notice to each affected business of the type of information to be disclosed and to whom it is to be disclosed. At the discretion of the office, such notice may be given by notice published in theat least 10 days prior to disclosure, or by letter sent by certified mail return receipt requested or telegram either of which must be received by the affected business at least 10 days prior to disclosure.

(iii) Disclosure to any Federal agency for purposes of performing an EPA statutory function under an interagency agreement.

(4) EPA notifies the other agency of any unresolved business confidentiality claim covering the information and of any determination under this subpart that the information is entitled to confidential treatment, and that further disclosure of the information may be a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1905; and

(5) The other agency agrees in writing not to disclose further any information designated as confidential unless-

(i) The other agency has statutory authority both to compel production of the information and to make the proposed disclosure, and the other agency has, prior to disclosure of the information to anyone other than its officers and employees, furnished to each affected business at least the same notice to which the affected business would be entitled under this subpart;

(ii) The other agency has obtained the consent of each affected business to the proposed disclosure; or

(iii) The other agency has obtained a written statement from the EPA General Counsel or an EPA Regional Counsel that disclosure of the information would be proper under this subpart.
