###### Emissions Test.

3.28An FTIR emissions test is performed according specific sampling and analytical procedures. These procedures, for the target analytes and the source, are based on previous screening and validation results. Emission results are quantitative. A QA spike (sections 8.6.2 and 9.2 of this method) is performed under each set of sampling conditions using a representative analyte. Flow, gas temperature and diluent data are recorded concurrently with the FTIR measurements to provide mass emission rates for detected compounds.
