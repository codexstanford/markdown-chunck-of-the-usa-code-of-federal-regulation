(ii) For cogeneration units-

(A) For units commencing operation before January 1, 1997, a unit with a maximum design heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr and qualifying as an unaffected unit under § 72.6(b)(4) of this chapter under the Acid Rain Program for 1995 and 1996.

(B) For units commencing operation in 1997 or 1998, a unit with a maximum design heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr and qualifying as an unaffected unit under § 72.6(b)(4) under the Acid Rain Program for 1997 and 1998.

(C) For units commencing on or after January 1, 1999, a unit with a maximum design heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr and qualifying as an unaffected unit under § 72.6(b)(4) of this chapter under the Acid Rain Program for each year.

(b)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a unit under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section that has a federally enforceable permit that restricts the unit to combusting only natural gas or fuel oil (as defined in § 75.2 of this chapter) during a control period includes a NOemission limitation restricting NOemissions during a control period to 25 tons or less, and includes the special provisions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall be exempt from the requirements of the NOBudget Trading Program, except for the provisions of this paragraph (b), § 97.2, § 97.3, § 97.4(a), § 97.7, and subparts E, F, and G of this part. The NOemission limitation under this paragraph (b)(1) shall restrict NOemissions during the control period by limiting unit operating hours. The restriction on unit operating hours shall be calculated by dividing 25 tons by the unit's maximum potential hourly NOmass emissions, which shall equal the unit's maximum rated hourly heat input multiplied by the highest default NOemission rate otherwise applicable to the unit under § 75.19 of this chapter.

(2) The exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall become effective as follows:

(i) The exemption shall become effective on the date on which the NOemission limitation and the special provisions in the permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section become final; or

(ii) If the NOemission limitation and the special provisions in the permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section become final during a control period and after the first date on which the unit operates during such control period, then the exemption shall become effective on May 1 of such control period, provided that such NOemission limitation and the special provisions apply to the unit as of such first date of operation. If such NOemission limitation and special provisions do not apply to the unit as of such first date of operation, then the exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall become effective on October 1 of the year during which such NOemission limitation and the special provisions become final.

(3) The permitting authority that issues a federally enforceable permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a unit under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section will provide the Administrator written notice of the issuance of such permit and, upon request, a copy of the permit.
