######## e.g.,

(C) The zero point can also can be established obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept; and

(D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.

(ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1:

(iii) With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, or its digital equivalent, and your three run average PM concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship of mg/dscm per milliamp or digital signal equivalent, with equation 2:

(iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp value, or per digital signal equivalent, from equation 2 in equation 3, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit:

(3) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital signal output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 4 and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(5) of this section:
