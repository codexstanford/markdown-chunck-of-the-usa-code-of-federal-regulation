####### Nonregenerative carbon adsorbers.

(v)For each nonregenerative carbon adsorption system such as a carbon canister that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device, the owner or operator shall replace the existing carbon bed in the control device with fresh carbon on a regular schedule based on one of the following procedures:

(A) Monitor the TOC concentration level in the exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system on a regular schedule, and replace the existing carbon with fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The monitoring frequency shall be daily or at an interval no greater than 20 percent of the time required to consume the total carbon working capacity under absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions as defined in ยง 63.1365(b)(11)(i) or (ii), whichever is longer.

(B) Establish the maximum time interval between replacement, and replace the existing carbon before this time interval elapses. The time interval shall be established based on the conditions anticipated under absolute or hypothetical peak-case, as defined in ยง 63.1365(b)(11)(i) or (ii).
