10.1.5

10.1.5.1 Correction of hourly pollutant concentration data for moisture is sometimes required when converting concentrations to the units of the applicable Hg emissions limit. In particular, these corrections are required:

10.1.5.1.1 To calculate electrical output-based pollutant emission rates, when using a CEMS that measures pollutant concentrations on a dry basis; and

10.1.5.1.2 To calculate heat input-based pollutant emission rates, when using certain equations from EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter.

10.1.5.2 If hourly moisture corrections are required, either use a fuel-specific default moisture percentage for coal-fired units from ยง 75.11(b)(1) of this chapter, an Administrator approved default moisture value for non-coal-fired units (as per paragraph 63.10010(d) of this subpart), or a certified moisture monitoring system that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, to record the required data. If you elect to use a moisture monitoring system, you must keep hourly records of the stack gas moisture content, as specified in ยง 75.57(c)(3) of this chapter.
