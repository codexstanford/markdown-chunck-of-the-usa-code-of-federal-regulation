######## Peak emissions period

means the period of consecutive hourly mass emissions of the applicable pollutant that is greater than any other period of consecutive hourly mass emissions for the same pollutant over the course of a specified batch process cycle, as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition. The peak emissions period is a function of the rate at which the temperature of the refractory shapes is increased, the mass and loading configuration of the shapes in the process unit, the constituents of the refractory mix, and the type of pollutants emitted.

(1) The 3-hour peak THC emissions period is the period of 3 consecutive hours over which the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions rates is greater than the sum of the hourly THC mass emissions rates for any other period of 3 consecutive hours during the same batch process cycle.

(2) The 3-hour peak HF emissions period is the period of 3 consecutive hours over which the sum of the hourly HF mass emissions rates is greater than the sum of the hourly HF mass emissions rates for any other period of 3 consecutive hours during the same batch process cycle.
