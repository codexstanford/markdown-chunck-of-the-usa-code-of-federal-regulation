###### ยง 1051.125 What maintenance instructions must I give to buyers?
####### Maintenance that is not emission-related.

(e)For maintenance unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data vehicles, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary. This might include adding engine oil, changing air, fuel, or oil filters, servicing engine-cooling systems, and adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, or injector lash, or adjusting chain tension, clutch position, or tire pressure. You may perform this nonemission-related maintenance on emission-data vehicles at the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser (but not the intervals recommended for severe service). You may also visually inspect test vehicles or engines, including emission-related components, as needed to ensure safe operation.
