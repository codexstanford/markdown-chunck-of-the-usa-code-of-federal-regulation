####### § 60.2145 How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
######## see

(i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference,§ 60.17), as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor;

(ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour;

(iii) Each sample must represent a 1-hour average; and

(iv) A minimum of three runs must be performed.

(u) For facilities using a CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for mercury to demonstrate initial and continuouscompliance with any of the emission limits of this subpart, you must complete the following:

(1) Demonstrate compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) using a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at appendix A-7 of this part. The 1-hour arithmetic averages for CEMS must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2). Except for CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems data during startup and shutdown, the 1-hour arithmetic averages used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations must be corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). Integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems or CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in the subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content; and

(2) Operate all CEMS and integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part.

(v) Use of the bypass stack at any time is an emissions standards deviation for PM, HCl, lead, cadmium, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dioxin/furans.

(w) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain a oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 60.2265 according to the procedures in paragraphs (w)(1) through (4) of this section:

(1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2140;

(2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (w)(3) of this section at all times;

(3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and

(4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.
