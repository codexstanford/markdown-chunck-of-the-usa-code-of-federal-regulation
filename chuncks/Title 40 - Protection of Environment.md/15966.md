###### Determination by the Administrator.

(c)(1) If no demonstrations are received by the Administrator within 90 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will become the designated COA without further action.

(2) If one or more demonstrations are received, the Administrator will issue a preliminary designation of the COA within 150 days of the receipt of the NOI, which shall be followed by a 30 day public comment period, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

(3) The Administrator will designate the COA for a specific source within 240 days of the receipt of the NOI.

(4) When the Administrator designates a more stringent area as the COA with respect to a specific OCS source, the delegated agency in the COA will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no delegated agency in the COA, then EPA will issue the permit and implement and enforce the requirements of this part. The Administrator may retain authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part if the NOA and the COA are in different States.

(5) The Administrator shall designate the COA for each source only once in the source's lifetime.
