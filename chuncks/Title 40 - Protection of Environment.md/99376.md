####### Staged assembly.

(a)You may ask us to provide a temporary exemption to allow you to complete production of your engines and locomotives at different facilities, as long as you maintain control of the engines until they are in their certified configuration. We may require you to take specific steps to ensure that such locomotives are in their certified configuration before reaching the ultimate purchaser. You may request an exemption under this paragraph (a) in your application for certification, or in a separate submission. If you include your request in your application, your exemption is approved when we grant your certificate. Note that no exemption is needed to ship an engine that has been assembled in its certified configuration, is properly labeled, and will not require an aftertreatment device to be attached when installed in the locomotive.
