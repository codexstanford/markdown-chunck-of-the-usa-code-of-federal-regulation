####### Electronic flow control.

(5)The Critical Flow Venturi-Electronic Flow Control-Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-EFC-CVS) system is identical to the CFV-CVS system described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this section, except that it maintains proportional sampling for methanol and formaldehyde by measuring the CVS flow rate, and electronically controlling sample flow rates. For methanol-fueled vehicles, the samples lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more than 5 &#xB0;F (3 &#xB0;C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C).
