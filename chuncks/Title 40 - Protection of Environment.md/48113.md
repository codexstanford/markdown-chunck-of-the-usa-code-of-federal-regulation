(h)(1) The test procedures for demonstrating compliance with COexhaust emission standards are described at ยง 86.101 and 40 CFR part 600, subpart B.

(2) Testing to determine compliance with COexhaust emission standards must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis for passenger automobiles and light trucks (including MDPV), and on an adjusted loaded vehicle weight (ALVW) basis for non-MDPV heavy-duty vehicles.

(3) Testing for the purpose of providing certification data is required only at low-altitude conditions. If hardware and software emission control strategies used during low-altitude condition testing are not used similarly across all altitudes for in-use operation, the manufacturer must include a statement in the application for certification, in accordance with ยง 86.1844-01(d)(11), stating what the different strategies are and why they are used.
