####### Integral intermediate

means an intermediate for which 50 percent or more of the annual production is used in on-site production of any PAI(s) and that is not stored before being used in the production of another integral intermediate or the PAI(s). For the purposes of this definition, an intermediate is stored if it is discharged to a storage vessel and at least one of the following conditions is met: the processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is shutdown before the processing equipment that withdraws from the storage vessel is started up; during an annual period, the material must be stored in the vessel for at least 30 days before being used to make a PAI; or the processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is located in a separate building (or processing area) of the plant than the processing equipment that uses material from the storage vessel as a feedstock, and control equipment is not shared by the two processing areas. Any process unit that produces an intermediate and is subject to subpart F of this part is not an integral intermediate.
