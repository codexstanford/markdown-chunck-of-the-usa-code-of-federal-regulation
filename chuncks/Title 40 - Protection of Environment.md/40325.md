4.1.1 Sorbent decomposition artifacts are VOCs that form when sorbents degenerate,when exposed to reactive species during sampling. For example, benzaldehyde, phenol, and acetophenone artifacts are reported to be formed via oxidation of the polymeric sorbent Tenax&#xAE; when sampling high concentration (100-500 ppb) ozone atmospheres (Reference 5).

4.1.2 Preparation and storage artifacts are VOCs that were not completely cleaned from the sorbent tube during conditioning or that are an inherent feature of that sorbent at a given temperature.
