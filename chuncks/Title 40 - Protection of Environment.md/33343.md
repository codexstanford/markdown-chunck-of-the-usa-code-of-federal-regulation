####### ยง 63.2262 How do I conduct performance tests and establish operating requirements?
######## Establishing operating requirements using THC CEMS.

(o)If you choose to meet the operating requirements by monitoring THC concentration instead of monitoring control device or process operating parameters, you must establish your THC concentration operating requirement according to paragraphs (o)(1) through (2) of this section.

(1) During the performance test, you must continuously monitor THC concentration using your CEMS during each of the required 1-hour test runs. The maximum THC concentration must then be established as the average of the three maximum 15-minute THC concentrations monitored during the three test runs. Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish a range of THC concentration values under different operating conditions.

(2) You may establish a different maximum THC concentration by submitting the notification specified in ยง 63.2280(g) and conducting a repeat performance test as specified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section that demonstrates compliance with the compliance options in Tables 1A and 1B to this subpart.
