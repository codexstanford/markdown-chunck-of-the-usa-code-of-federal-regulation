####### Tolerance

means the interval in which at least 95% of a set of recorded values of a certain quantity must lie. Use the specified recording frequencies and time intervals to determine if a quantity is within the applicable tolerance. The concept of tolerance is intended to address random variability. You may not take advantage of the tolerance specification to incorporate a bias into a measurement.
