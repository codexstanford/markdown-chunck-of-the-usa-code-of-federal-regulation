(e)-(1)(i) Generate a polydisperse glycerol test aerosol.

(ii) Introduce the aerosol into the transport system.

(iii) Monitor the aerosol size and concentration until stability and level have been achieved.

(iv) Condition the candidate method sampler and reference method sampler filters until total dynamic conditioning is achieved as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(v) Record the dynamically conditioned weight as InitWtand InitWtwhere c is the candidate method sampler and r is the reference method sampler.
