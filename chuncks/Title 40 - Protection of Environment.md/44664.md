####### Review of certification of intent to import for destruction.

(7)(i) Starting on the first working day following receipt by the Administrator of a certification of intent to import a class I controlled substance for destruction, the Administrator will initiate a review of the information submitted under paragraph (g)(5) of this section and take action within 30 working days to issue either an objection notice or a non-objection notice for the individual shipment to the person who submitted the certification of intent to import the class I controlled substance for destruction.

(ii) The Administrator may issue an objection notice if the petition lacks or appears to lack any of the information required under paragraph (g)(5) of this section or for the reasons listed in paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B) through (F) of this section.

(iii) In cases where the Administrator does not object to the petition, the Administrator will issue a non-objection notice.

(iv) To pass the approved class I controlled substances through U.S. Customs, the non-objection notice issued by EPA must accompany the shipment through U.S. Customs.

(v) If for some reason, following EPA's issuance of a non-objection notice, new information is brought to EPA's attention which shows that the non-objection notice was issued based on false information, then EPA has the right to:

(A) Revoke the non-objection notice;

(B) Pursue all means to ensure that the class I controlled substance is not imported into the United States; and

(C) Take appropriate enforcement actions.
