######## Hybrid suspension grate boiler

means a boiler designed with air distributors to spread the fuel material over the entire width and depth of the boiler combustion zone. The biomass fuel combusted in these units exceeds a moisture content of 40 percent on an as-fired annual heat input basis as demonstrated by monthly fuel analysis. The drying and much of the combustion of the fuel takes place in suspension, and the combustion is completed on the grate or floor of the boiler. Fluidized bed, dutch oven, and pile burner designs are not part of the hybrid suspension grate boiler design category.
