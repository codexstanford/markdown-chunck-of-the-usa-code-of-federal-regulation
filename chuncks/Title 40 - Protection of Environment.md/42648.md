###### ยง 75.31 Initial missing data procedures.
####### i.e.,

(a) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification of the required SO, CO, O, or moisture monitoring system(s) at a particular unit or stack location (the date and time at which quality assured data begins to be recorded by CEMS(s) installed at that location), and during the first 2,160 quality assured monitor operating hours following initial certification of the required NO-diluent, NOconcentration, or flow monitoring system(s) at the unit or stack location, the owner or operator shall provide substitute data required under this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The owner or operator of a unit shall use these procedures for no longer than three years (26,280 clock hours) following initial certification.

(b) SO, CO, or Oconcentration data, and moisture data. For each hour of missing SOor COemissions concentration data (including COdata converted from Odata using the procedures in appendix F of this part), or missing Oor COdiluent concentration data used to calculate heat input, or missing moisture data, the owner or operator shall calculate the substitute data as follows:

(1) Whenever prior quality-assured data exist, the owner or operator shall substitute, by means of the data acquisition and handling system, for each hour of missing data, the average of the hourly SO, CO, or Oconcentrations or moisture percentages recorded by a certified monitor for the unit operating hour immediately before and the unit operating hour immediately after the missing data period.

(2) Whenever no prior quality assured SO, CO, or Oconcentration data or moisture data exist, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for each hour of missing data, the maximum potential SOconcentration or the maximum potential COconcentration or the minimum potential Oconcentration or (unless Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NOemission rate) the minimum potential moisture percentage, as specified, respectively, in sections 2.1.1.1, 2.1.3.1, 2.1.3.2 and 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part. If Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NOemission rate, substitute the maximum potential moisture percentage, as specified in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part.
