You must report:

(a) COprocess emissions from steam reforming of a hydrocarbon or the gasification of solid and liquid raw material, reported for each ammonia manufacturing process unit following the requirements of this subpart (COprocess emissions reported under this subpart may include COthat is later consumed on site for urea production, and therefore is not released to the ambient air from the ammonia manufacturing process unit).

(b) CO, CH, and NO emissions from each stationary fuel combustion unit. You must report these emissions under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), by following the requirements of subpart C, except that for ammonia manufacturing processes subpart C does not apply to any COresulting from combustion of the waste recycle stream (commonly referred to as the purge gas stream).

(c) COemissions collected and transferred off site under subpart PP of this part (Suppliers of CO), following the requirements of subpart PP.
