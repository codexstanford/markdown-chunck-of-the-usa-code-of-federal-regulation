####### Tubing and packer.

(c)(1) Tubing and packer materials used in the construction of each Class VI well must be compatible with fluids with which the materials may be expected to come into contact and must meet or exceed standards developed for such materials by the American Petroleum Institute, ASTM International, or comparable standards acceptable to the Director.

(2) All owners or operators of Class VI wells must inject fluids through tubing with a packer set at a depth opposite a cemented interval at the location approved by the Director.

(3) In order for the Director to determine and specify requirements for tubing and packer, the owner or operator must submit the following information:

(i) Depth of setting;

(ii) Characteristics of the carbon dioxide stream (chemical content, corrosiveness, temperature, and density) and formation fluids;

(iii) Maximum proposed injection pressure;

(iv) Maximum proposed annular pressure;

(v) Proposed injection rate (intermittent or continuous) and volume and/or mass of the carbon dioxide stream;

(vi) Size of tubing and casing; and

(vii) Tubing tensile, burst, and collapse strengths.
