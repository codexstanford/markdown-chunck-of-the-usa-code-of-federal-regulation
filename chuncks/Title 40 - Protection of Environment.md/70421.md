###### Definition of hazardous substance migration path for overland/flood migration component.

4.1.1.1The hazardous substance migration path includes both the overland segment and the in-water segment that hazardous substances would take as they migrate away from sources at the site:

- Begin the overland segment at a source and proceed downgradient to the probable point of entry to surface water.

- Begin the in-water segment at this probable point of entry.

For sites that consist of contaminated sediments with no identified source, the hazardous substance migration path consists solely of the in-water segment specified in section 4.1.1.2.

Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit. If the site is in more than one watershed, define a separate hazardous substance migration path for each watershed. Evaluate the overland/flood migration component for each watershed separately as specified in section 4.1.1.3.
