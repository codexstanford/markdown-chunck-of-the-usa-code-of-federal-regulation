###### ยง 797.1330 Daphnid chronic toxicity test.
####### Care and handling of test organisms.

(v)(A) Daphnids should be cultured in dilution water under similar environmental conditions to those used in the test. A variety of foods have been demonstrated to be adequate for daphnid culture. They include algae, yeasts and a variety of mixtures.

(B) Organisms should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary it should be done as gently, carefully, and quickly as possible. During culturing and acclimation, daphnids should be observed carefully for ephippia and other signs of stress, physical damage, and mortality. Dead and abnormal individuals shall be discarded. Organisms that touch dry surfaces or are dropped or injured during handling shall be discarded.

(C) Smooth glass tubes (I.D. greater than 5mm) equipped with a rubber bulb can be used for transferring daphnids with minimal culture media carry-over.

(D) Care should be exercised to introduce the daphnids below the surface of any solution so as not to trap air under the carapace.
