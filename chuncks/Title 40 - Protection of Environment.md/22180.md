###### 3.16 System Bias

means the difference between a calibration gas measured in direct calibration mode and in system calibration mode. System bias is determined before and after each run at the low- and mid- or high-concentration levels. For dilution-type systems, pre- and post-run system calibration error is measured rather than system bias.
