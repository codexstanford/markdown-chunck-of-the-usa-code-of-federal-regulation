##### ยง 140.4 Complete prohibition.

(a) Prohibition pursuant to CWA section 312(f)(3): a State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not, into some or all of the waters within such State by making a written application to the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, and by receiving the Administrator's affirmative determination pursuant to section 312(f)(3) of the Act. Upon receipt of an application under section 312(f)(3) of the Act, the Administrator will determine within 90 days whether adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels using such waters are reasonably available. Applications made by States pursuant to section 312(f)(3) of the Act shall include:

(1) A certification that the protection and enhancement of the waters described in the petition require greater environmental protection than the applicable Federal standard;

(2) A map showing the location of commercial and recreational pump-out facilities;

(3) A description of the location of pump-out facilities within waters designated for no discharge;

(4) The general schedule of operating hours of the pump-out facilities;

(5) The draught requirements on vessels that may be excluded because of insufficient water depth adjacent to the facility;

(6) Information indicating that treatment of wastes from such pump-out facilities is in conformance with Federal law; and

(7) Information on vessel population and vessel usage of the subject waters.

(b) Prohibition pursuant to CWA section 312(f)(4)(A): a State may make a written application to the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, under section 312(f)(4)(A) of the Act, for the issuance of a regulation completely prohibiting discharge from a vessel of any sewage, whether treated or not, into particular waters of the United States or specified portions thereof, which waters are located within the boundaries of such State. Such application shall specify with particularly the waters, or portions thereof, for which a complete prohibition is desired. The application shall include identification of water recreational areas, drinking water intakes, aquatic sanctuaries, identifiable fish-spawning and nursery areas, and areas of intensive boating activities. If, on the basis of the State's application and any other information available to him, the Administrator is unable to make a finding that the waters listed in the application require a complete prohibition of any discharge in the waters or portions thereof covered by the application, he shall state the reasons why he cannot make such a finding, and shall deny the application. If the Administrator makes a finding that the waters listed in the application require a complete prohibition of any discharge in all or any part of the waters or portions thereof covered by the State's application, he shall publish notice of such findings together with a notice of proposed rule making, and then shall proceed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553. If the Administrator's finding is that applicable water quality standards require a complete prohibition covering a more restricted or more expanded area than that applied for by the State, he shall state the reasons why his finding differs in scope from that requested in the State's application.

(1) For the following waters the discharge from a vessel of any sewage (whether treated or not) is completely prohibited pursuant to CWA section 312(f)(4)(A):

(i) Boundary Waters Canoe Area, formerly designated as the Superior, Little Indian Sioux, and Caribou Roadless Areas, in the Superior National Forest, Minnesota, as described in 16 U.S.C. 577-577d1.
