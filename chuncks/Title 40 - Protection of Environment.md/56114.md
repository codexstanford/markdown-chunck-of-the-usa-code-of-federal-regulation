####### Initial sampling for water systems.

(b)Any large water system without corrosion control treatment must monitor for water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section during the first two six-month tap sampling monitoring periods beginning no later than January 1 of the calendar year after the system either becomes a large water system, or fails to maintain their 90th percentile for lead below the PQL for lead. Any medium or small system that exceeds the lead or copper action level and any system with corrosion control treatment for which the State has not designated OWQPs that exceeds the lead trigger level shall monitor for water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for two consecutive 6-month periods beginning the month immediately following the end of the tap sampling period in which the exceedance occurred.

(1) At taps, two samples for:

(i) pH;

(ii) Alkalinity;

(2) At each entry point to the distribution system all of the applicable parameters listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
