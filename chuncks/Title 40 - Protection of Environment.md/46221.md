####### Stuck in range above the lowest maximum enable temperature.

(D)The OBD system must detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a temperature above the lowest maximum enable temperature required by the OBD system to enable other monitors (e.g., an OBD system that requires an engine coolant temperature less than 90 degrees Fahrenheit at startup prior to enabling an OBD monitor must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to indicate inappropriately a temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit). The manufacturer may forego this requirement within temperature regions in which the monitors required under paragraphs (i)(1)(ii), (i)(1)(iii)(B), (i)(1)(iii)(C) of this section will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in this paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(D) or in which the MIL will be activated according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. The manufacturer may also forego this monitoring within temperature regions where a temperature gauge on the instrument panel indicates a temperature in the "red zone" (engine overheating zone) and displays the same temperature information as used by the OBD system.
