####### ยง 63.5753 How do I calculate the combined organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents and aluminum recreational boat surface coatings?

(a) Use equation 1 of this section to calculate the combined weighted-average organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents and aluminum recreational boat surface coatings.

(b) Compliance is based on a 12-month rolling average. If the combined organic HAP content does not exceed 1.55 kilograms of organic HAP per liter of total coating solids, then you are in compliance with the emission limit specified in ยง 63.5743(a)(3).
