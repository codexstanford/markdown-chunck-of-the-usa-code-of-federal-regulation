###### Distilled water is used as a reference instead of the reagent blank because of the sensitivity of the reagent blank to temperature.)

6. After 30 minutes and before 60 minutes, determine the corrected absorbances (equation 10) of each solution at 548 nm using 1-cm optical path length cells against a distilled water reference (Section 10.1). (

7. Do not allow the colored solution to stand in the cells because a film may be deposited. Clean the cells with isopropyl alcohol after use.

8. The reagent blank must be within 0.03 absorbance units of the intercept of the calibration equation determined in Section 10.
