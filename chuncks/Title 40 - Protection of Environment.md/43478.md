###### ยง 79.62 Subchronic toxicity study with specific health effect assessments.
####### Carcinogenicity/mutagenicity(C/M) assessment.,in vivo

(2)When combined with the subchronic toxicity study, the main study population is used to perform both theMN and SCE assays. Because of the constant turnover of the cells to be analyzed in these assays, a separate study population may be used for this assessment. A study population needs only to be exposed a minimum of four weeks. At exposure's end, ten animals per exposure and control groups are anaesthetized and heart punctures are performed on all members. After separating blood components, individual lymphocyte cell cultures are set up for SCE analysis. One femur from each study subject is also removed and the marrow extracted. The marrow is smeared onto a glass slide, and stained for analysis of micronuclei in erythrocytes.
