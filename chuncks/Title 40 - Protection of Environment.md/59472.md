####### Criteria for approval.

(b)The Administrator may authorize a specific, public health, or quarantine exemption, based on the information available to the Agency, after:

(1) He determines that:

(i) An emergency condition exists;

(ii) The use of the pesticide under the exemption will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;

(iii) Registration of the pesticide use for which the exemption is requested has not been suspended under section 6(c) of the Act or cancelled following a notice under section 6(b) of the Act, unless the use is authorized in accordance with the provisions of §§ 164.130 through 164.133 of this chapter;

(2) Giving due consideration to:

(i) Whether the pesticide is reasonably likely to be used in compliance with the requirements imposed by the Agency under the exemption; and

(ii) The progress which has been made toward registration of the proposed use, if a repeated specific or public health exemption is sought. It shall be presumed that if a complete application for registration of a use, which has been under a specific or public health exemption for any 3 previous years, or any 5 previous years if the use is supported for registration by the IR-4 program, has not been submitted, reasonable progress towards registration has not been made.
