####### Small manufacturer

(5)means a manufacturer (including importers) who meets either paragraph (a)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section:

(i) A manufacturer of a chemical substance is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $40 million. However, if the annual production volume of a particular chemical substance at any individual site owned or controlled by the manufacturer is greater than 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds), the manufacturer shall not qualify as small for purposes of reporting on the production of that chemical substance at that site, unless the manufacturer qualifies as small under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.

(ii) A manufacturer of a chemical substance is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $4 million, regardless of the quantity of the particular chemical substance produced by that manufacturer.

(iii) For imported mixtures containing a chemical substance identified in paragraph (b) of this section, the 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds) standard in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section applies only to the amount of the chemical substance in a mixture and not the other components of the mixture.
