##### Subpart DDDD - Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units
###### Model Rule - Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
####### ยง 60.2675 What operating limits must I meet and by when?
######## e.g.,

(e) If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).

(f) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI), and the reagent flow rate during the nitrogen oxides performance testing. The operating limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the highest 1-hour average charge rate, lowest secondary chamber temperature, and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitations.
