####### Required testing for diesel-fueled/compression ignition engines,Fuel system.

(i)-(A)The manufacturer must perform a separate test for each malfunction limit established by the manufacturer for the fuel system parameters (e.g., fuel pressure, injection timing) specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (g)(1)(ii)(C) and/or (g)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, if applicable, of this section. When performing a test for a specific parameter, the fuel system must be operating at the malfunction criteria limit for the applicable parameter only. All other parameters must be operating with normal characteristics. In conducting the fuel system demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the fuel system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.
