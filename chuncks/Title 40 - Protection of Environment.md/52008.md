####### Intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG

, for the purposes of determining fluorinated GHG emissions using the stack testing method, means a fluorinated GHG that meets all of the following:

(1) The fluorinated GHG is used by the fab but is not used during the period of stack testing for the fab/stack system.

(2) The emissions of the fluorinated GHG, estimated using the methods in ยง 98.93(i)(4) do not constitute more than 5 percent of the total fluorinated GHG emissions from the fab on a COe basis.

(3) The sum of the emissions of all fluorinated GHGs that are considered intermittent low use gases does not exceed 10,000 metric tons COe for the fab for that year, as calculated using the procedures specified in ยง 98.93(i)(1) of this subpart.

(4) The fluorinated GHG is not an expected or possible by-product identified in Table I-17 of this subpart.
