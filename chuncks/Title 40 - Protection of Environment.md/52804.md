####### Site-specific emission factor method.

(3)Use Equations CC-3, CC-4, and CC-5 of this section to determine annual COprocess emissions from manufacturing lines that use the liquid alkaline feedstock process to produce soda ash. You must conduct an annual performance test and measure COemissions and flow rates at all process vents from the mine water stripper/evaporator for each manufacturing line and calculate COemissions as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

(i) During the performance test, you must measure the process vent flow from each process vent during the test and calculate the average rate for the test period in metric tons per hour.

(ii) Using the test data, you must calculate the hourly COemission rate using Equation CC-3 of this section:

(iii) Using the test data, you must calculate a COemission factor for the process using Equation CC-4 of this section:

(iv) You must calculate annual COprocess emissions from each manufacturing line using Equation CC-5 of this section:

(4) Calculate and report under subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources) the combustion CO, CH, and NO emissions in the soda ash manufacturing line according to the applicable requirements in subpart C.
