####### NO,compliance allowance for in-use testing.

(y)A NOcompliance allowance of 15 mg/hp&#xB7;hr applies for any in-use testing of Medium HDE and Heavy HDE as described in subpart E of this part. Add the compliance allowance to the NOstandard that applies for each duty cycle and for off-cycle testing, with both field testing and laboratory testing. The NOcompliance allowance does not apply for the bin 1 off-cycle standard. As an example, for manufacturer-run field-testing of a Heavy HDE, add the 15 mg/hp&#xB7;hr compliance allowance and the 5 mg/hp&#xB7;hr accuracy margin from ยง 1036.420 to the 58 mg/hp&#xB7;hr&#xB7;bin 2 off-cycle standard to calculate a 78 mg/hp&#xB7;hr NOstandard.
