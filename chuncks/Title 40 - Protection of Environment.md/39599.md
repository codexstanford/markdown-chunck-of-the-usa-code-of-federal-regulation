###### Standards and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.11646 What are my compliance requirements?
######## i.e.,

(iv) For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces during the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (tons of concentrate) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.

(13) After the initial compliance test, calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source for each 12-month period preceding each subsequent compliance test in pounds of mercury per ton of process input using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(13)(i) through (iv) of this section to determine compliance with the emission standards in ยง 63.11645.

(i) For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the sum of the total amount of gold mine ore processed (in million tons) in that 12-month period.

(ii) For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.

(iii) For carbon processes without mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.

(iv) For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.

(b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
