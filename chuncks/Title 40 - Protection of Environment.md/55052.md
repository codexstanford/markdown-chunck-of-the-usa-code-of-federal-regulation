(ii)(A) Bacteriological Criteria. The geometric mean of the enterococci bacteria densities in samples taken over a 30 day period shall not exceed 8 per 100 milliliters, nor shall any single sample exceed an enterococci density of 35 per 100 milliliters. These limits are calculated as the geometric mean of the collected samples approximately equally spaced over a thirty day period.

(B) Dissolved oxygen-The dissolved oxygen shall exceed 9.5 mg/l.

(C) Total dissolved gas-concentrations shall not exceed 110 percent of the saturation value for gases at the existing atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures at any point of sample collection.

(D) Temperature-shall not exceed 16.0 degrees C due to human activities. Temperature increases shall not, at any time, exceed t = 23/(T + 5).
