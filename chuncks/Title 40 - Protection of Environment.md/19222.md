###### ยง 60.544 Monitoring of operations.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that facility by the Administrator:

(1) Where a thermal incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder for the temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring device shall have an accuracy of 1 percent of the temperature being measured in &#xB0;C or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater.

(2) Where a catalytic incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, temperature monitoring devices, each equipped with a continuous recorder, for the temperature in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of 1 percent of the temperature being measured in &#xB0;C or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater.

(3) For an undertread cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation where a carbon adsorber is used to meet the performance requirements specified under ยง 60.543(j)(6), an organics monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds based on a detection principle such as infrared, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, equipped with a continous recorder, for the outlet of the carbon bed.

(b) An owner or operator of an undertread cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation where a VOC recovery device other than a carbon adsorber is used to meet the performance requirements specified under ยง 60.543(j)(6), shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) which would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The Administrator may request further information and will specify appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
