####### Test conditions,Solvent/vehicle.

(2)-(i)The solvent/vehicle should not be suspected of chemical reaction with the test substance and must be compatible with the survival of the cells and the S9 activity. If other than well-known solvent/vehicles are used, their inclusion should be supported by data indicating their compatibility. It is recommended that wherever possible, the use of an aqueous solvent/vehicle be considered first. When testing water-unstable substances, the organic solvents used should be free of water. Water can be removed by adding a molecular sieve.
