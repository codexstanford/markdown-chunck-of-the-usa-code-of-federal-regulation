######## Determination of CO,emissions using appendix G to this part.

(b)If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix G method, then the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in appendix G to this part for estimating daily COmass emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted. For units with wet flue gas desulfurization systems or other add-on emissions controls generating CO, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in appendix G to this part to estimate both combustion-related emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted and sorbent-related emissions based on the amount of sorbent injected. The owner or operator shall calculate daily, quarterly, and annual COmass emissions (in tons) in accordance with the procedures in appendix G to this part.
