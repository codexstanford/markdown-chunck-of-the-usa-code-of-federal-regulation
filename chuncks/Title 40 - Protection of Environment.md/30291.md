(ii)You must include the following in your eligibility demonstration to implement the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit:

(A) For incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns, calculations to confirm that the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate that you calculate from the total chlorine emission rate you select for each combustor does not exceed the limits provided by paragraph (b)(7) of this section;

(B) Comparison of the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each combustor to the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for the total chlorine emission rate you select for each combustor;

(C) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each hazardous waste combustor, and the limits on operating parameters required under paragraph (g)(1) of this section;

(D) Determination of the long-term chlorine feedrate limit, including the total chlorine system removal efficiency for sources that establish an (up to) annual rolling average feedrate limit under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section;
