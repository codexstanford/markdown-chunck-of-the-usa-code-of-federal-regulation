####### Durability program objective.

(a)The durability program must predict an expected in-use emission deterioration rate and emission level that effectively represents a significant majority of the distribution of emission levels and deterioration in actual use over the full useful life of candidate in-use vehicles of each vehicle design which uses the durability program. This requirement applies for all SHED-based measurements except the bleed emission test. The standard for bleed emissions applies for the full useful life, but manufacturers do not need to establish deterioration factors for bleed emissions. The requirements of this section do not apply for spitback or leak standards.
