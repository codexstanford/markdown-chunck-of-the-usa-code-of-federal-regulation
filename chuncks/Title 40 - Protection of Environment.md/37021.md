####### ยง 63.7830 What are my monitoring requirements?

(a) For each capture system subject to an operating limit in ยง 63.7790(b)(1) established in your capture system operation and maintenance plan, you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in ยง 63.7831(e) and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Dampers that are manually set and remain in the same position are exempt from the requirement to install and operate a CPMS.
