####### Design evaluation.,4,4

(ii)A design evaluation and supporting documentation that addresses the operating characteristics of the treatment process and that is based on operation at a wastewater stream flow rate and a concentration under which it would be most difficult to demonstrate compliance. For closed biological treatment processes, the percent reduction from removal/destruction in the treatment unit and control device shall be determined by a mass balance over the unit. The mass flow rate of soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds exiting the treatment process shall be the sum of the mass flow rate of soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds in the wastewater stream exiting the biological treatment process and the mass flow rate of the vented gas stream exiting the control device. The mass flow rate entering the treatment process minus the mass flow rate exiting the process determines the actual mass removal. Compounds that meet the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section are not required to be included in the design evaluation; the term "performance test" in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section shall mean "design evaluation" for the purposes of this paragraph.
