(3) For each feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that was produced by blending a petroleum-based product with a biomass-based product, report the percent of the volume reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is petroleum-based (excluding any denaturant that may be present in any ethanol product).

(4)-(5) [Reserved]

(6) For each petroleum product and natural gas liquid (ex refinery gate) listed in Table MM-1 of this subpart, report the annual quantity in metric tons or barrels. For natural gas liquids, quantity shall reflect the individual components of the product. Petroleum products and natural gas liquids that enter the refinery, but are not reported in (a)(2), shall not be reported under this paragraph.

(7) For each product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that was produced by blending a petroleum-based product with a biomass-based product, report the percent of the volume reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that is petroleum-based (excluding any denaturant that may be present in any ethanol product).

(8) [Reserved]

(9) For every feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 of this subpart was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The number of samples collected according to § 98.394(c)

(ii) The sampling standard method used.

(iii) The carbon share test results in percent mass.

(iv) The standard method used to test carbon share.

(v) The calculated COemissions factor in metric tons COper barrel or per metric ton of product.

(10) For every non-solid feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 of this subpart was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The density test results in metric tons per barrel.

(ii) The standard method used to test density.

(11) For every petroleum product and natural gas liquid reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 of this subpart was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The number of samples collected according to § 98.394(c).

(ii) The sampling standard method used.

(iii) The carbon share test results in percent mass.

(iv) The standard method used to test carbon share.

(v) The calculated COemissions factor in metric tons COper barrel or per metric ton of product.

(12) For every non-solid petroleum product and natural gas liquid reported in paragraph (a)(6) for which Calculation Method 2 was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The density test results in metric tons per barrel.

(ii) The standard method used to test density.

(13) [Reserved]

(14) For each specific type of biomass that enters the refinery to be co-processed with petroleum feedstocks to produce a petroleum product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, report the annual quantity in metric tons or barrels.

(15) [Reserved]

(16) The COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each petroleum product and natural gas liquid (ex refinery gate) reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that were calculated according to § 98.393(a) or (h).

(17) The COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that were calculated according to § 98.393(b) or (h).

(18) The COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each type of biomass feedstock co-processed with petroleum feedstocks reported in paragraph (a)(14) of this section, calculated according to § 98.393(c).

(19) The sum of COemissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of all products, calculated according to § 98.393(d).

(20) For all crude oil that enters the refinery, report the annual quantity in barrels.

(21) The quantity of bulk NGLs in metric tons or barrels received for processing during the reporting year. Report only quantities of bulk NGLs not reported in (a)(2) of this section.

(22) Volume of crude oil in barrels that you injected into a crude oil supply or reservoir.

(b) In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each importer shall report all of the following information at the corporate level:

(1) [Reserved]
