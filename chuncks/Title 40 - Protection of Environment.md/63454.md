###### ยง 227.27 Limiting permissible concentration (LPC).

(a) The limiting permissible concentration of the liquid phase of a material is:

(1) That concentration of a constituent which, after allowance for initial mixing as provided in ยง 227.29, does not exceed applicable marine water quality criteria; or, when there are no applicable marine water quality criteria,

(2) That concentration of waste or dredged material in the receiving water which, after allowance for initial mixing, as specified in ยง 227.29, will not exceed a toxicity threshold defined as 0.01 of a concentration shown to be acutely toxic to appropriate sensitive marine organisms in a bioassay carried out in accordance with approved EPA procedures.

(3) When there is reasonable scientific evidence on a specific waste material to justify the use of an application factor other than 0.01 as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, such alternative application factor shall be used in calculating the LPC.

(b) The limiting permissible concentration of the suspended particulate and solid phases of a material means that concentration which will not cause unreasonable acute or chronic toxicity or other sublethal adverse effects based on bioassay results using appropriate sensitive marine organisms in the case of the suspended particulate phase, or appropriate sensitive benthic marine organisms in the case of the solid phase; and which will not cause accumulation of toxic materials in the human food chain. Suspended particulate phase bioaccumulation testing is not required. These bioassays are to be conducted in accordance with procedures approved by EPA, or, in the case of dredged material, approved by EPA and the Corps of Engineers.
