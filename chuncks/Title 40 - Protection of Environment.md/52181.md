##### Subpart L - Fluorinated Gas Production
###### ยง 98.126 Data reporting requirements.
####### Emissions from production and transformation processes, facility level, multiple products.

(4)If your facility produces more than one fluorinated gas product, you must report the information in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable, for emissions from production and transformation processes.

(i) For each fluorinated GHG with emissions of 1,000 metric tons of COe or more from production and transformation processes, summed across the facility as a whole, you must report the total mass in metric tons of the fluorinated GHG emitted from production and transformation processes, summed across the facility as a whole. If the fluorinated GHG does not have a chemical-specific GWP in Table A-1 of subpart A, identify the fluorinated GHG group of which that fluorinated GHG is a member.

(ii) For all other fluorinated GHGs emitted from production and transformation processes, you must report the total GWP-weighted emissions from production and transformation processes of those fluorinated GHGs by fluorinated GHG group, summed across the facility as a whole, in metric tons of COe.
