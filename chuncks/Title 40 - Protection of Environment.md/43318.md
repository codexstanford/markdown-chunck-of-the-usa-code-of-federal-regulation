####### Use of exhaust aftertreatment devices.

(d)(1) If the selected test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, does not come equipped with an emissions aftertreatment device (such as a catalyst or particulate trap), such device shall not be used in the context of this program.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for certain specialized additives, the following provisions apply when the test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, comes equipped with an emissions aftertreatment device.

(i) For mileage accumulation:

(A) When the test formulation does not contain any atypical elements (pursuant to definitions in ยง 79.56(e)(4)(iii)), an intact aftertreatment device must be used during mileage accumulation.

(B) When the test formulation does contain atypical elements, then the manufacturer may choose to accumulate the required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its catalytic wash coat). In either case, sampling and analysis of emissions for measurement of the mass of the atypical element(s) (as described in ยง 79.57(c)(3)) must be done on emissions generated with a non-functional (blank) aftertreatment device.
