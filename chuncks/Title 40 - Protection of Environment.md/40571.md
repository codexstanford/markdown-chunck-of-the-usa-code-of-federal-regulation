####### Revisions to the plan.

(4)Based on the results of a determination made under ยง 65.3(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of a regulated source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in the following:

(i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the regulated source that has occurred; or

(ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the regulated source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or

(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or

(iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified and defined in ยง 65.3(a)(4).
