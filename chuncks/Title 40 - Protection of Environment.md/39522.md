###### Standards and Compliance Requirements
####### § 63.11585 What are my notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements?
######## i.e.,

(B) The first compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date follows the end of the first calendar half after the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.11580 (January 31 for a source that is existing with a compliance date of December 30, 2010).

(C) Each subsequent compliance report for a period in which deviations occur must cover the semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.

(D) Each subsequent compliance report for a period in which deviations occur must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.

(ii) If no deviations occur, then:

(A) The first compliance report must cover the period beginning on the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.11580 and ending on December 31 following the end of the first calendar year after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.11580.

(B) The first compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than January 31 following the end of the first calendar year after the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.11580.

(C) Each subsequent compliance report for a period in which deviations occur must cover the annual reporting period from January 1 through December 31.

(D) Each subsequent compliance report for a period in which no deviations occur must be postmarked or delivered no later than January 31 immediately following the previous calendar year.

(3) The compliance report must contain the following information:

(i) Company name and address.

(ii) Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the content of the report.

(iii) Date of report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.

(iv) If there are no deviations from the emission reduction or 0.03 gr/dscf PM concentration requirements as specified in Table 1, a statement that there were no deviations from the emission reduction or 0.03 gr/dscf PM concentration requirements during the reporting period.

(v) If there were no periods during which the CPMS (if a CPMS is used to demonstrate compliance) was out-of-control as defined by the manufacturer's recommendations, a statement that there were no periods during which the CPMS was out-of-control during the reporting period.

(vi) A description of any changes in monitoring systems or CPMS, processes (including changes that establish the basis for certification that the PM concentration from process vents will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf or the addition of new processes), or controls since the last reporting period or for the first compliance report, since the notification of compliance status report.

(4) For each deviation, as applicable and as defined in § 63.11588, you must include the information in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section, and the information in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (4)(ix) of this section that apply to you.

(i) The date and time that each deviation started and stopped.

(ii) The date and time that each bag leak detector, parameter monitor, or CPMS was inoperative, except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks.

(iii) If a CPMS is used, the date, time and duration that each CPMS was out-of-control.

(iv) A summary of the total duration of the deviation during the reporting period and the total duration as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period.

(v) A list of reasons for the deviations during the reporting period.

(vi) If a CPMS is used, a summary of the total duration of CPMS downtime during the reporting period and the total duration of CPMS downtime as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period.

(vii) A brief description of the process units.

(viii) A brief description of the bag leak detector, parameter monitor, or CPMS.

(ix) If a CPMS is used, the date of the latest CPMS certification or audit.

(5) If acceptable to both the Administrator and you, you may submit reports and notifications electronically.

(d) What records must I maintain?

(1) You must maintain the following records:

(i) A copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart, including all documentation supporting any Initial Notification of Applicability or NOCSR that you submitted, according to the requirements in § 63.10(b)(2)(xiv).

(ii) Records identifying periods when the chemical preparations operation is in target HAP service using:

(A) Production records showing the dates and times the chemical preparations operation is processing target HAP-containing materials; and

(B) Material safety data sheets (MSDS) of target HAP-containing materials being processed.

(iii) Records of performance tests and performance evaluations as required in § 63.10(b)(2)(viii).

(iv) Records of CPMS (if a CPMS is used to demonstrate compliance) calibration checks and adjustments and maintenance performed on CPMS as required by § 63.10(b)(2)(x) and (xi).

(v) Records of CPMS as required by § 63.10(c) and § 63.11583(d)(5).

(vi) Records of all inspections as required by § 63.11584(b) and pressure measurement device checks (if applicable) as required by § 63.11583(e)(6).

(vii) Records of the site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.11583(f).

(viii) Records of particulate control device manufacturing specifications and recommendations.

(2) You must maintain the records specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iii) of this section.

(i) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review, according to § 63.10(b)(1).

(iii) You must keep each record onsite for at least 2 years after the date of each recorded action according to § 63.10(b)(1). You may keep the records offsite for the remaining 3 years.

(3) If you are providing certification that the particulate matter concentration of each of the process vent streams from equipment in target HAP service within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf, you must maintain the following records according to paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iii) of this section:

(i) Records of the initial certification statement and supporting documentation specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

(ii) Records of ductwork inspections specified in § 63.11584(d)(4).
