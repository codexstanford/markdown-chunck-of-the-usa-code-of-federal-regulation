(b)If the fugitive emission control plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section proposes to meet the requirements of §§ 57.501 and 57.503 through the additional use of a supplementary control system, the plan shall demonstrate that the use of supplementary controls at that smelter to prevent violations of the NAAQS resulting from fugitive emissions is practicable, adequate, reliable, and enforceable. The plan shall contain increments of progress providing for completion of the implementation of each additional measure, and for corresponding compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 57.404, within four months of approval of the plan by the issuing agency. The plan shall also provide that within three months after completion of implementation of those additional measures, the smelter shall fully comply with the requirements of §§ 57.401 and 57.501 (including the assumption of liability for violations of NAAQS within its designated liability area), and shall submit and additional SCS report for the approval of the issuing agency. This additional final report shall correspond to that submitted under § 57.405(b)(2), except that it need not contain the 3-month study described in § 57.405(b)(2)(iii).
