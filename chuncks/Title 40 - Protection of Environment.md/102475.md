####### Sealed

means lacking openings to the atmosphere that would allow a measurable amount of liquid or vapor to leak out under normal operating pressures or other pressures specified in this part. For example, you may generally establish a maximum value for operating pressures based on the highest pressure you would observe from an installed fuel tank during continuous equipment operation on a sunny day with ambient temperatures of 35 &#xB0;C. A fuel system may be considered to have no measurable leak if it does not release bubbles when held underwater at the identified tank pressure for 60 seconds. This determination presumes the use of good engineering judgment; for example, it would not be appropriate to test the fuel tank such that small leaks would avoid detection by collecting in a cavity created by holding the tank with a certain orientation. Sealed fuel systems may have openings for emission controls or for fuel lines needed to route fuel to the engine.
