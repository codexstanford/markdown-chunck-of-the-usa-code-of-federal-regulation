() For the modification, each pollutant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase.

(ii) The plan shall provide that, with respect to any such pollutant for which no National Ambient Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air quality monitoring data as the reviewing authority determines is necessary to assess ambient air quality for that pollutant in any area that the emissions of that pollutant would affect.

(iii) The plan shall provide that with respect to any such pollutant (other than nonmethane hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis shall contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of determining whether emissions of that pollutant would cause or contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable increase.

(iv) The plan shall provide that, in general, the continuous air monitoring data that is required shall have been gathered over a period of one year and shall represent the year preceding receipt of the application, except that, if the reviewing authority determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over a period shorter than one year (but not to be less than four months), the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period.

(v) The plan may provide that the owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification of volatile organic compounds who satisfies all conditions of 40 CFR part 51 appendix S, section IV may provide postapproval monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as required under paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
