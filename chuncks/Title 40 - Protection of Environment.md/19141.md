####### Single burn rate wood heater

means a wood heater that is not equipped with or installed with a burn control device to allow the operator to vary burn rate conditions. Burn rate control devices include stack dampers that control the outflow of flue gases from the heater to the chimney, whether built into the appliance, sold with it, or recommended for use with the heater by the manufacturer, retailer or installer; and air control slides, gates or any other type of mechanisms that control combustion air flow into the heater.
