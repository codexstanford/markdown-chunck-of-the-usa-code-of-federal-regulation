####### Polymerization reaction section

means the equipment designed to cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (e.g., oligomers or low molecular weight polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw materials for polymerization (e.g., esterification vessels). For the purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from PET plants is included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process section.
