######## Averaging, banking, and trading.

(c)You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with COemission standards. Credits (positive and negative) are calculated from the difference between the FCL and the applicable emission standard. As described in § 1036.705, you may use COcredits to certify your engine families to FELs for NO and/or CH, instead of the NO/CHstandards of this section that otherwise apply. Except as specified in §§ 1036.150 and 1036.705, you may not generate or use credits for NO or CHemissions.
