###### Test Condition.

3.18A period of sampling where all process, and sampling conditions, and emissions remain constant and during which a single sampling technique and a single analytical program are used. One Run may include results for more than one test condition. Constant emissions means that the composition of the emissions remains approximately stable so that a single analytical program is suitable for analyzing all of the sample spectra. A greater than two-fold change in analyte or interferant concentrations or the appearance of additional compounds in the emissions, may constitute a new test condition and may require modification of the analytical program.
