####### Certified product data sheet (CPDS)

means documentation furnished by coating or adhesive suppliers or an outside laboratory that provides:

(1) The VHAP content of a finishing material, contact adhesive, or solvent, by percent weight, measured using the EPA Method 311 (as promulgated in this subpart), or an equivalent or alternative method (or formulation data if the coating meets the criteria specified in ยง 63.805(a));

(2) The solids content of a finishing material or contact adhesive by percent weight, determined using data from the EPA Method 24, or an alternative or equivalent method (or formulation data if the coating meets the criteria specified in ยง 63.805 (a)); and

(3) The density, measured by EPA Method 24 or an alternative or equivalent method. Therefore, the reportable VHAP content shall represent the maximum aggregate emissions potential of the finishing material, adhesive, or solvent in concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight or 0.1 percent for VHAP that are carcinogens, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR part 1910), as formulated. Only VHAP present in concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight, or 0.1 percent for VHAP that are carcinogens, must be reported on the CPDS. The purpose of the CPDS is to assist the affected source in demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations presented in ยง 63.802.
