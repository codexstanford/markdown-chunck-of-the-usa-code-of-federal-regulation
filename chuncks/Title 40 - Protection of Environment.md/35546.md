###### Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
####### § 63.4941 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## Compliance demonstration.

(e)The calculated organic HAP content for each coating used during the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890 and each thinner and cleaning material used during the initial compliance period must contain no organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep all records required by §§ 63.4930 and 63.4931. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required in § 63.4910(c) and the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.4920, you must identify each coating operation and group of coating operations for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the emission limit, include a statement that each coating operation was in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because it used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, and it used no thinners or cleaning materials that contained organic HAP.
