###### Particulate weight catch per size fraction.,i.e.,

12.3.2.3Correct each of the PM weights per size fraction by subtracting the acetone blank weight (M-W). (Do not subtract a blank value of greater than 0.1 mg per 100 ml of the acetone used from the sample recovery.) Use the following procedures.

(a) Use Equation 45 to calculate the PM recovered from Containers #1, #2, #3, and #4. This is the total collectible PM (C).

(b) Use Equation 46 to determine the quantitative recovery of PM(C) from Containers #1, #3, and #4.

(c) Use Equation 47 to determine the quantitative recovery of PM(C) recovered from Containers #1 and #4.

12.4 Reporting. You must prepare a test report following the guidance in EPA Guidance Document 043, Preparation and Review of Test Reports (December 1998).

12.5 Equations. Use the following equations to complete the calculations required in this test method.
