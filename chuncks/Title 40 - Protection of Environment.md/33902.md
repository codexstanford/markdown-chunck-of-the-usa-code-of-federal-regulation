###### Notifications, Reports, and Records
####### ยง 63.2860 What notifications must I submit and when?
######## Initial notifications for new and reconstructed sources.

(b)New or reconstructed sources must submit a series of notifications before, during, and after source construction per the schedule listed in ยง 63.9. The information requirements for the notifications are the same as those listed in the General Provisions with the exceptions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) The application for approval of construction does not require the specific HAP emission data required in ยง 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H) and (iii), (d)(2) and (d)(3)(ii). The application for approval of construction would include, instead, a brief description of the source including the types of listed oilseeds processed, nominal operating capacity, and type of desolventizer(s) used.

(2) The notification of actual startup date must also include whether you have elected to operate under an initial startup period subject to ยง 63.2850(c)(2) and provide an estimate and justification for the anticipated duration of the initial startup period.
