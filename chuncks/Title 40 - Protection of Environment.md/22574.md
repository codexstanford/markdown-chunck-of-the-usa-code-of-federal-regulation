###### e.g.,

(1) Optical Alignment. Objectively indicate proper alignment relative to reference marks (bull's-eye) or conditions.

(2) Calibration Error. The calibration error must be &#x2264;3 percent opacity for each of the three calibration attenuators.

(3) System Response Time. The COMS upscale and downscale response times must be &#x2264;10 seconds as measured at the COMS data recorder.

(4) Averaging Period Calculation and Recording. The COMS data recorder must average and record each calibration attenuator value to within +/-2 percent opacity of the certified value of the attenuator.

(5) Operational Test Period. The COMS must be able to measure and record opacity and to perform daily calibration drift assessments for 168 hours without unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.

(6) Zero and Upscale Calibration Drift Error. The COMS zero and upscale calibration drift error must not exceed 2 percent opacity over a 24 hour period.

1.2 Applicability.

1.2.1 This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of SOand NOcontinuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of installation or soon after and whenever specified in the regulations. The CEMS may include, for certain stationary sources, a diluent (Oor CO) monitor.

1.2.2 This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and other auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS performance. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR Part 60, ยง 60.13(c).

Procedures for measuring CEMS relative accuracy and calibration drift are outlined. CEMS installation and measurement location specifications, equipment specifications, performance specifications, and data reduction procedures are included. Conformance of the CEMS with the Performance Specification is determined.
