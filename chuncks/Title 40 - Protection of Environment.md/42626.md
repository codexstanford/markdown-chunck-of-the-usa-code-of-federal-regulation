###### ยง 75.20 Initial certification and recertification procedures.
####### Approval of certification applications.

(3)The provisions for the certification application formal approval process in the introductory text of paragraph (a)(4) and in paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section shall apply, except that "continuous emission or opacity monitoring system" shall be replaced with "low mass emissions excepted methodology." Provisional certification status for the low mass emissions methodology begins on the date of submittal (consistent with the definition of "submit" in ยง 72.2 of this chapter) of a complete certification application, and the methodology is considered to be certified either upon receipt of a written approval notice from the Administrator or, if such notice is not provided, at the end of the Administrator's 120-day review period. However, in contrast to CEM systems or appendix D and E monitoring systems, a provisionally certified or certified low mass emissions excepted methodology may not be used to report data under the Acid Rain Program or in a NOmass emissions reduction program under subpart H of this part prior to the applicable commencement date specified in ยง 75.19(a)(2)(i).
