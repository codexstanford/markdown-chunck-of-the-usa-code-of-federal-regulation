####### Redetermination of applicability to PMPUs that are flexible operation units.

(10)Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a PMPU that is operating as a flexible operation unit from a polyether polyol to a product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of this part, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the primary product, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be designated as a PMPU after the compliance date of the other subpart, and shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this subpart after the date that the process unit is required to be in compliance with the provisions of the other subpart. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit shall continue to be considered a PMPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(i) The product identified as the primary product is not polyether polyol;

(ii) The production of the product identified as the primary product is subject to another subpart of this part; and

(iii) The owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
