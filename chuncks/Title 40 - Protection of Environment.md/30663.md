###### § 63.1256 Standards: Wastewater.
####### Individual drain systems.

(e)For each individual drain system that receives or manages affected wastewater or a residual removed from affected wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e) (1), (2), and (3) or with paragraphs (e) (4), (5), and (6) of this section.

(1) If the owner or operator elects to comply with this paragraph, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain on each opening in the individual drain system a cover and if vented, route the vapors to a process or through a closed-vent system to a control device. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (v) of this section.

(i) The cover and all openings shall meet the following requirements:

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the cover and all openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports) shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.1258(h).

(B) The cover and all openings shall be maintained in a closed position at all times that affected wastewater or a residual removed from affected wastewater is in the drain system except when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

(ii) The control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, the closed-vent system shall be inspected in accordance with § 63.1258(h).

(iv) For any cover and closed-vent system that is operated and maintained under negative pressure, the owner or operator is not required to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.1258(h).

(v) The individual drain system shall be designed and operated to segregate the vapors within the system from other drain systems and the atmosphere.

(2) Each individual drain system shall be inspected initially, and semiannually thereafter, for improper work practices and control equipment failures, in accordance with § 63.1258(g).

(i) For individual drain systems, improper work practice includes, but is not limited to, leaving open any access hatch or other opening when such hatch or opening is not in use for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

(ii) For individual drain systems, control equipment failure includes, but is not limited to, any time a joint, lid, cover, or door has a gap or crack, or is broken.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when an improper work practice or a control equipment failure is identified, first efforts at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after identification and repair shall be completed within 15 calendar days after identification.

(4) If the owner or operator elects to comply with this paragraph, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(4) (i) through (iii) of this section:

(i) Each drain shall be equipped with water seal controls or a tightly fitting cap or plug. The owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) For each drain equipped with a water seal, the owner or operator shall ensure that the water seal is maintained. For example, a flow-monitoring device indicating positive flow from a main to a branch water line supplying a trap or water being continuously dripped into the trap by a hose could be used to verify flow of water to the trap. Visual observation is also an acceptable alternative.

(B) If a water seal is used on a drain receiving affected wastewater, the owner or operator shall either extend the pipe discharging the wastewater below the liquid surface in the water seal of the receiving drain, or install a flexible shield (or other enclosure which restricts wind motion across the open area between the pipe and the drain) that encloses the space between the pipe discharging the wastewater to the drain receiving the wastewater. (Water seals which are used on hubs receiving wastewater that is not subject to the provisions of this subpart for the purpose of eliminating cross ventilation to drains carrying affected wastewater are not required to have a flexible shield or extended subsurface discharging pipe.)

(ii) Each junction box shall be equipped with a tightly fitting solid cover (i.e., no visible gaps, cracks, or holes) which shall be kept in place at all times except during inspection and maintenance. If the junction box is vented, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section.

(A) The junction box shall be vented to a process or through a closed-vent system to a control device. The closed-vent system shall be inspected in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1258(h) and the control device shall be designed, operated, and inspected in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
