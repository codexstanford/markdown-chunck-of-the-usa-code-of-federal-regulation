####### § 63.2396 What compliance options do I have if part of my plant is subject to both this subpart and another subpart?
######## Compliance with other regulations for storage tanks.

(a)(1) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342, you are in compliance with the provisions of this subpart for any storage tank that is assigned to the OLD affected source and that is both controlled with a floating roof and is in compliance with the provisions of either 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart Y, except that records shall be kept for 5 years rather than 2 years for storage tanks that are assigned to the OLD affected source.

(2) After the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342, you are in compliance with the provisions of this subpart for any storage tank with a fixed roof that is assigned to the OLD affected source and that is both controlled with a closed vent system and control device and is in compliance with either 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart Y, except that you must comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in this subpart.

(3) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as an alternative to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, if a storage tank assigned to the OLD affected source is subject to control under 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart Y, you may elect to comply only with the requirements of this subpart for storage tanks meeting the applicability criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart.

(4) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342(e), the applicability criteria for control specified in Table 2 to this subpart for storage tanks at an existing affected source no longer apply as specified in § 63.2346(a)(5). Instead, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342(e), as an alternative to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, if a storage tank assigned to an existing OLD affected source is subject to control under 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, or 40 CFR part 61, subpart Y, you may elect to comply only with the requirements of this subpart for storage tanks at an existing affected source meeting the applicability criteria for control in Table 2b to this subpart.
