(2) For each temperature selected, perform testing to assess the aging metric at different times. These time intervals do not need to be evenly spaced and it is typical to run these experiments using increasing time intervals (after 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 hours). Use good engineering judgment to stop each temperature experiment after sufficient data has been generated to characterize the shape of the deactivation behavior at a given temperature.

(d) Generate a fit of the deactivation data generated in paragraph (b) of this section at each temperature using the generalized deactivation equation:
