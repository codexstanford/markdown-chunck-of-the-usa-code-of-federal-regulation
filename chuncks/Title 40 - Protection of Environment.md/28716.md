####### Performance tests and flare compliance assessments schedule.

(c)(1) Unless a waiver of performance testing or flare compliance assessment is obtained under this section or the conditions of a referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall perform such tests as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section.

(i) Within 180 days after the effective date of a relevant standard for a new source that has an initial start-up date before the effective date of that standard; or

(ii) Within 180 days after initial start-up for a new source that has an initial start-up date after the effective date of a relevant standard; or

(iii) Within 180 days after the compliance date specified in a referencing subpart for an existing source, or within 180 days after start-up of an existing source if the source begins operation after the effective date of the relevant emission standard; or

(iv) Within 180 days after the compliance date for an existing source subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act; or

(v) Within 180 days after the termination date of the source's extension of compliance or a waiver of compliance for an existing source that obtains an extension of compliance under § 63.1112(a), or waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.11; or

(vi) Within 180 days after the compliance date for a new source, subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act but before the proposal date of the relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(f); or

(vii) When the promulgated emission standard in a referencing subpart is more stringent than the standard that was proposed, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date, or within 180 days after start-up of the source, whichever is later. If a promulgated standard in a referencing subpart is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance initially with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after start-up of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.

(2) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests and compliance assessments at the regulated source at any time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.

(3) Unless already permitted by the applicable title V permit, if an owner or operator elects to use a recovery device to replace an existing control device at a later date, or elects to use a different flare, nonflare control device or recovery device to replace an existing flare, nonflare control device or final recovery device at a later date, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, either by amendment of the regulated source's title V permit or, if title V is not applicable, by submission of the notice specified in § 63.999(c)(7) before implementing the change. Upon implementing the change, a compliance demonstration or performance test shall be performed according to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable, within 180 days. The compliance assessment report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days of completing the determination, as provided in § 63.999(a)(1)(ii).

(i) For flares used to replace an existing control device, a flare compliance demonstration shall be performed using the methods specified in § 63.987(b);

(ii) For flares used to replace an existing final recovery device that is used on an applicable process vent, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions in a referencing subpart and in this subpart;

(iii) For incinerators, boilers, or process heaters used to replace an existing control device, a performance test shall be performed, using the methods specified in § 63.997;

(iv) For absorbers, condensers, or carbon adsorbers used to replace an existing control device on a process vent or a transfer rack, a performance test shall be performed, using the methods specified in § 63.997;

(v) For absorbers, condensers, or carbon adsorbers used to replace an existing final recovery device on a process vent, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions of a referencing subpart and this subpart;
