() If the repair or replacement of a fugitive emissions component designated difficult-to-monitor or unsafe-to-monitor is technically infeasible; would require a vent blowdown, a compressor station shutdown, a well shutdown, or well shut-in; or would be unsafe to repair during operation of the unit, the repair or replacement must be completed during the next scheduled compressor station shutdown, well shutdown, or well shut-in; after a planned vent blowdown; or within 2 years, whichever is earlier; and

(C) Procedures for verifying leaking component repairs, no more than 30 calendar days after repairing the leak;

(vi) Training and experience needed before performing surveys;

(vii) Procedures for calibration and maintenance of any fugitive emissions monitoring device to be used; and

(viii) Standard monitoring protocols for each type of typical oil and natural gas source (e.g., well site, tank battery, compressor station), including a general list of component types that will be inspected and what supporting data will be recorded (e.g., wind speed, detection method device-specific operational parameters, date, time, and duration of inspection).

(2) The owner or operator is exempt from inspecting and repairing a fugitive emissions component under any of the following circumstances:

(i) The contacting process stream only contains glycol, amine, methanol, or produced water; or

(ii) The component to be inspected is buried, insulated in a manner that prevents access to the components by a monitor probe or optical gas imaging device, or obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the components by a monitor probe or optical gas imaging device.
