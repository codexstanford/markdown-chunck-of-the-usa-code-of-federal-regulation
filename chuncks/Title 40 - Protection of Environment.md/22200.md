###### 7.1.4 Converter Efficiency Gas. What reagents do I need for the converter efficiency test?

The converter efficiency gas is a manufacturer-certified gas with a concentration sufficient to show NOconversion at the concentrations encountered in the source. A test gas concentration in the 40 to 60 ppm range is suggested, but other concentrations may be more appropriate to specific sources. For the test described in section 8.2.4.1, NOis required. For the alternative converter efficiency tests in section 16.2, NO is required.
