When a carbon adsorber is used, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test. Each 24-hour period is considered a performance test period for determining compliance with ยง 63.746(b)(1). For uncontrolled organic emissions from depainting operations, each calendar year is considered a performance test period for determining compliance with the HAP limits for organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used for spot stripping and decal removal.
