###### Contents of petition for a final alternative emission limitation.

(e)After the approved demonstration period, the designated representative of the unit may petition the permitting authority for an alternative emission limitation. The petition shall include the following elements in a format prescribed by the Administrator:

(1) Identification of the unit;

(2) Certification that the owner(s) or operator operated the affected unit and the NOemission control system during the demonstration period in accordance with: specifications and procedures designed to achieve the maximum NOreduction possible with the installed NOemission control system or the applicable emissions limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7; the operating conditions (including load dispatch conditions) upon which the design of the NOemission control system was based; and vendor specifications and procedures.

(3) Certification that the owner(s) or operator have installed in the affected unit all NOemission control systems, made any operational modifications, and completed any planned upgrades and/or maintenance to equipment specified in the approved demonstration period plan for optimizing NOemission reduction performance, consistent with the demonstration period plan and the proper operation of the installed NOemission control system. Such certification shall explain any differences between the installed NOemission control system and the equipment configuration described in the approved demonstration period plan.

(4) A clear description of each step or modification taken during the demonstration period to improve or optimize the performance of the installed NOemission control system.

(5) Engineering design calculations and drawings that show the technical specifications for installation of any additional operational or emission control modifications installed during the demonstration period.

(6) Unit operating and quality-assured continuous emission monitoring data (including the specific data listed in § 76.14(b)) collected in accordance with part 75 of this chapter during the demonstration period and demonstrating the inability of the specific unit to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 on an annual average basis while operating in accordance with the certification under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(7) A report (based on the parametric test requirements set forth in the approved demonstration period plan as identified in paragraph (d)(13) of this section), that demonstrates the unit was operated in accordance with the operating conditions upon which the design of the NOemission control system was based and describes the reason or reasons for the failure of the installed NOemission control system to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 on an annual average basis.

(8) The minimum NOemission rate, in lb/mmBtu, that the affected unit can achieve on an annual average basis with the installed NOemission control system. This value, which shall be the requested alternative emission limitation, shall be derived from the data specified in this section using methods and procedures satisfactory to the Administrator and shall be the lowest annual emission rate the unit can achieve with the installed NOemission control system;

(9) All supporting data and calculations documenting the determination of the requested alternative emission limitation and its conformance with the methods and procedures satisfactory to the Administrator;

(10) The special provisions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

(11) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit with a Group 1 boiler that has installed an alternative technology in addition to or in lieu of low NOburner technology and cannot meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5 shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the actual percentage reduction in NOemissions (lbs/mmBtu), on an annual average basis is greater than 65 percent of the average annual NOemissions prior to the installation of the NOemission control system. The percentage reduction in NOemissions shall be determined using continuous emissions monitoring data for NOtaken during the time period (under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) prior to the installation of the NOemission control system and during long-term load dispatch operation of the specific boiler.
