###### General Requirements for Compliance With the Emission Standards and for Monitoring and Performance Tests
####### ยง 63.3360 What performance tests must I conduct?
######## Organic HAP content.

(c)If you determine compliance with the emission standards in ยง 63.3320 by means other than determining the overall organic HAP control efficiency of a control device, you must determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material "as-purchased" by following one of the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, and determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material "as-applied" by following the procedures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If the organic HAP content values are not determined using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator must submit an alternative test method for determining their values for approval by the Administrator in accordance with ยง 63.7(f). The recovery efficiency of the test method must be determined for all of the target organic HAP and a correction factor, if necessary, must be determined and applied.
