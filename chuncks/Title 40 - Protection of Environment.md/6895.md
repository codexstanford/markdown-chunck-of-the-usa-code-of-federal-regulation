###### Severability.

L.If any provision of this Ruling, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this Ruling, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.

The necessary emission offsets may be proposed either by the owner of the proposed source or by the local community or the State. The emission reduction committed to must be enforceable by authorized State and/or local agencies and under the Clean Air Act, and must be accomplished by the new source's start-up date. If emission reductions are to be obtained in a State that neighbors the State in which the new source is to be located, the emission reductions committed to must be enforceable by the neighboring State and/or local agencies and under the Clean Air Act. Where the new facility is a replacement for a facility that is being shut down in order to provide the necessary offsets, the reviewing authority may allow up to 180 days for shakedown of the new facility before the existing facility is required to cease operation.
