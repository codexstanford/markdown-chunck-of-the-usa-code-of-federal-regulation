####### Process vent testing.

(1)Conduct an emissions test that is based on representative performance of the process or operating scenario(s) of the process, as applicable. For process vents for which you performed an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated GHG that was identified in the initial scoping speciation. For process vents for which you did not perform an initial scoping speciation, include in the emission test any fluorinated greenhouse gas that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or, where a destruction device is used, in the inlet to the destruction device. You may include startup and shutdown events if the testing is sufficiently long or comprehensive to ensure that such events are not overrepresented in the emission factor. Malfunction events must not be included in the testing. If you do not detect a fluorinated GHG that was identified in the scoping speciation or that occurs in more than trace concentrations in the vent stream or in the inlet to the destruction device, assume that fluorinated GHG was emitted at one half of the detection limit.
