######## i.e.,

(5) Records associated with your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.8242(a)(3) (results of inspections, calibrations, and validation checks of each mercury concentration continuous monitoring system (CMS)).

(6) Records of chlorine production on a weekly basis.

(c) Records associated with the work practice standards for mercury emissions that must be kept prior to the compliance date in § 63.8186(a)(2).

(1) If you choose not to institute a cell room monitoring program according to § 63.8192(g) of this subpart, you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) Records specified in Table 9 to this subpart related to the work practice standards in Tables 1 through 4 of this subpart.

(ii) Your current floor-level mercury vapor measurement plan.

(iii) Records of the average value calculated from at least three measurements taken according to your floor-level mercury vapor measurement plan.

(iv) Records indicated in § 63.8192(d)(4)(i) for maintenance activities that cause the floor-level mercury concentration to exceed the action level.

(v) Records of all inspections and corrective actions taken in response to a non-maintenance related situation in which the mercury vapor concentration exceeds the floor-level mercury concentration action level.

(2) You must maintain a copy of your current washdown plan and records of when each washdown occurs.

(3) You must maintain records of the mass of virgin mercury added to cells for each reporting period.

(4) If you choose to institute a cell room monitoring program according to § 63.8192(g) of this subpart, you must keep your current cell room monitoring plan and the records specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) Records of the monitoring conducted in accordance with § 63.8192(g)(2)(i) to establish your action level, and records demonstrating the development of this action level.

(ii) Records of the cell room mercury concentration monitoring data collected.

(iii) Instances when the action level is exceeded.

(iv) Records specified in § 63.8192(g)(4)(i) for maintenance activities that cause the mercury vapor concentration to exceed the action level.

(v) Records of all inspections and corrective actions taken in response to a non-maintenance related situation in which the mercury vapor concentration exceeds the action level.

(d) Records associated with the periodic monitoring option if your final control device is not a nonregenerable carbon adsorber. You must keep the records in paragraph (d)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Records of the CPMS data collected during the performance test as specified in § 63.8232(f)(1).

(2) Records documenting the development of the maximum monitoring value or minimum monitoring value, as appropriate, according to § 63.8232(f)(2).

(3) Records of hourly average values of applicable parameters monitored as specified in § 63.8244(b)(2)(ii) or (iii).

(e) Records associated with the work practice standards for mercury emissions that must be kept after the compliance date in § 63.8186(a)(2).

(2) You must maintain a copy of your current washdown plan and records of when each washdown occurs.

(3) You must maintain records of the mass of virgin mercury added to cells for each reporting period.

(4) You must keep your current cell room monitoring plan and the records specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) Records of the monitoring conducted in accordance with § 63.8192(g)(2)(i) to establish your action level, and records demonstrating the development of this action level.

(ii) Records of the cell room mercury concentration monitoring data collected.

(iii) Instances when the action level is exceeded.

(iv) Records specified in § 63.8192(g)(4)(i) for maintenance activities that cause the mercury vapor concentration to exceed the action level.
