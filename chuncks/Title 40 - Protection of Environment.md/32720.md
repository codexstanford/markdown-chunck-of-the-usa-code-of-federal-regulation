######## In-line fluxer.

(j)Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section for an in-line fluxer using no reactive flux material, the owner or operator of an in-line fluxer must use the limits in this paragraph to determine the emission standards for a SAPU.

(1) 0.02 kg of HCl per Mg (0.04 lb of HCl per ton) of feed/charge;

(2) 0.005 kg of PM per Mg (0.01 lb of PM per ton) of feed/charge.

(3) The emission limits in paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(2) of this section do not apply to an in-line fluxer that uses no reactive flux materials.

(4) The owner or operator of an in-line fluxer at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere visible emissions in excess of 10 percent opacity from any PM add-on air pollution control device used to control emissions from the in-line fluxer, if a COM is chosen as the monitoring option.

(5) The owner or operator may determine the emission standards for a SAPU by applying the in-line fluxer limits on the basis of the aluminum production weight in each in-line fluxer, rather than on the basis of feed/charge.
