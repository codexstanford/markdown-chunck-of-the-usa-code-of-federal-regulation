(1)(i) On the full OBD rating (i.e., the parent rating) as defined in paragraph (o)(1) of this section, separate in-use emissions thresholds shall apply. These thresholds are determined by doubling the applicable thresholds as shown in Table 1 of paragraph (g) and Table 2 of paragraph (h) of this section. The resultant thresholds apply only in-use and do not apply for certification or selective enforcement auditing.

(ii) The extrapolated OBD ratings (i.e., the child ratings) as defined in paragraph (o)(1) of this section shall not be evaluated against emissions levels for purposes of OBD compliance in-use.

(iii) Only the test cycle and standard determined and identified by the manufacturer at the time of certification in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section as the most stringent shall be used for the purpose of determining OBD system noncompliance in-use.

(iv) An OBD system shall not be considered noncompliant solely due to a failure or deterioration mode of a monitored component or system that could not have been reasonably foreseen to occur by the manufacturer.
