() Established procedures for stock culture preparation, marker verification and storage should be used. The amino-acid requirement for growth should be demonstrated for each frozen stock culture preparation (histidine forstrains, and tryptophan forstrains). Other phenotypic characteristics should be similarly checked, namely: the presence or absence of R-factor plasmids where appropriate [i.e. ampicillin resistance in strains TA98, TA100 and TA97a or TA97, WP2and WP2(pKM101), and ampicillin = tetracycline resistance in strain TA102]; the presence of characteristic mutations (i.e. rfa mutation inthrough sensitivity to crystal violet, andmutation inormutation inthrough sensitivity to ultra-violet light). The strains should also yield spontaneous revertant colony plate counts within the frequency ranges expected from the laboratory's historical control data and preferably within the range reported in the literature.
