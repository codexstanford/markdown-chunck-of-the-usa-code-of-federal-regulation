####### Stationary Source Permitting and Air Pollutant Emission Notice Requirements,

(128) On May 25, 2011, the State of Colorado submitted revisions to 5 CCR 1001-5, Regulation 3,parts A, B, and D. The May 25, 2011 submittal addresses the permitting of sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The revisions to portions of parts A, B, and D incorporate the provisions of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. The revisions establish thresholds for determining which new stationary sources and modifications to existing stationary sources become subject to Colorado's PSD permitting requirements for their GHG emissions. These revisions are consistent with federal requirements for PSD permitting.
