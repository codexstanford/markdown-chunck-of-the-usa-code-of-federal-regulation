####### Excepted monitoring for low mass emissions units under § 75.19(c)(1)(iv).

(d)For oil-and gas-fired units using the optional SO, NOand COemissions calculations for low mass emission units under § 75.19, the owner or operator shall record the following information for tests performed to determine a fuel and unit-specific default as provided in § 75.19(c)(1)(iv):

(1) For each run of each test performed using the procedures of section 2.1 of appendix E to this part, record the following data:

(i) Unit or common pipe identification code;

(ii) Run start date and time;

(iii) Run end date and time;

(iv) NOemission rate (lb/mmBtu) from reference method;

(v) Response time of the Oand NOreference method analyzers;

(vi) Type of fuel(s) combusted during the run;

(vii) Test number;

(viii) Run number;

(ix) Operating level during the run;

(x) NOconcentration recorded by the reference method during the run;

(xi) Diluent concentration recorded by the reference method during the run;

(xii) Moisture measurement for the run (if applicable); and

(xiii) An indicator ("flag") if the run is used to calculate the highest 3-run average NOemission rate at any load level.

(2) For each single-load or multiple-load appendix E test, record the following:

(i) The three-run average NOemission rate for each load level;

(ii) An indicator that the average NOemission rate is the highest NOaverage emission rate recorded at any load level of the test (if appropriate);

(iii) The default NOemission rate (highest three-run average NOemission rate at any load level);

(iv) An indicator that the add-on NOemission controls were operating or not operating during each run of the test;

(v) Parameter data indicating the use and efficacy of control equipment during the test; and

(vi) Indicator of whether the testing was done at base load, peak load or both (if appropriate); and

(vii) The default NOemission rate for peak load hours (if applicable).

(3) For each unit in a group of identical units qualifying for reduced testing under § 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(B), record the following data:

(i) The unique group identification code assigned to the group. This code must include the ORIS code of one of the units in the group;

(ii) The ORIS code or facility identification code for the unit;

(iii) The plant name of the facility at which the unit is located, consistent with the facility's monitoring plan;

(iv) The identification code for the unit, consistent with the facility's monitoring plan;

(v) A record of whether or not the unit underwent fuel and unit-specific testing for purposes of establishing a fuel and unit-specific NOemission rate for purposes of § 75.19;

(vi) The completion date of the fuel and unit-specific test performed for purposes of establishing a fuel and unit-specific NOemission rate for purposes of § 75.19;

(vii) The fuel and unit-specific NOdefault rate established for the group of identical units under § 75.19;

(viii) The type of fuel combusted for the units during testing and represented by the resulting default NOemission rate;

(ix) The control status for the units during testing and represented by the resulting default NOemission rate;
