####### Multiple Ferrous Melting Furnace Scrubber Configuration.

(h)A multiple ferrous melting furnace scrubber configuration is a configuration where two or more discrete wet scrubbing devices are employed in series in a single melting furnace exhaust gas stream. The ferrous melting furnace scrubber mass allowance shall be given to each discrete wet scrubbing device that has an associated wastewater discharge in a multiple ferrous melting furnace scrubber configuration. The mass allowance for each discrete wet scrubber shall be identical and based on the air flow of the exhaust gas stream that passes through the multiple scrubber configuration.
