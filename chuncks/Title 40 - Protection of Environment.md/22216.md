###### 12.4 System Calibration Error.

Use Equation 7E-3 to calculate the system calibration error for dilution systems. Equation 7E-3 applies to both the initial 3-point system calibration error test and the subsequent 2-point calibration error checks between test runs. In this equation, the term "C" refers to the diluted calibration gas concentration measured by the analyzer.
