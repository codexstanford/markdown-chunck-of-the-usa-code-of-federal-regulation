8.1A screening test is ideal for obtaining proper data that can be used for preparing analytical program files. Information from literature surveys and source personnel is also acceptable. Information about the sampling location and gas stream composition is required to determine the optimum sampling system configuration for measuring HCl. Determine the percent moisture of the kiln gas by Method 4 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter or by performing a wet bulb/dry bulb measurement. Perform a preliminary traverse of the sample duct or stack and select the sampling point(s). Acquire an initial spectrum and determine the optimum operational pathlength of the instrument.
