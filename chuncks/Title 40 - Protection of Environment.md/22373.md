###### 9.6 Field Train Proof Blank Assessment.

Conduct at least one field train proof blank for each test series at a single facility. A field train proof blank is used to evaluate equipment preparation and potential contamination during sample recovery and consists of a fully assembled train at the sampling site. Prepare and assemble the field train proof blank train in a manner identical to that described in Sections 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 of this method using glassware from the same preparation batch as the field samples. The field train proof blank train must remain assembled for the same average amount of time samples are collected. Recover the field train proof blank train as described in Section 8.2 of this method. Follow all subsequent steps for field train proof blank train sample preparation and analysis used for field samples including data reporting. Section 13.1 of this method describes the criteria for the field train proof blank.
