A procedure that expresses the toxicity of PCDD, PCDF, and PCB in terms of the most toxic dioxin, as specified in applicable regulations, permits, or other requirements.

Despite interferences, confidence of the data is based on the enhanced selectivity of fractionation, gas chromatograph (GC) separation and detector resolving power, the QC check ions, and monitoring PCDPE.
