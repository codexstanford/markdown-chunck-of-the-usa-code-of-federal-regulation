(47)(i) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, dated April 20, 1998, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.

(ii) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 8, 2002, effective March 11, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.

(iii) EPA has granted the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) "up-front" approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the Virginia DEQ may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for International Paper Company's Franklin Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Pulp and Paper Industry found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S. The Virginia DEQ may only establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The VA DEQ must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: (1) Submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, (2) obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and (3) issue a CAA Title V permit for the Franklin Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the Virginia DEQ has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, International Paper Company's Franklin Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S.
