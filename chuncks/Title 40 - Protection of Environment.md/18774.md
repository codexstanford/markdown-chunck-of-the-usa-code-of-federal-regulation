####### Metallic mineral concentrate

means a material containing metallic compounds in concentrations higher than naturally occurring in ore but requiring additional processing if pure metal is to be isolated. A metallic mineral concentrate contains at least one of the following metals in any of its oxidation states and at a concentration that contributes to the concentrate's commercial value: Aluminum, copper, gold, iron, lead, molybdenum, silver, titanium, tungsten, uranium, zinc, and zirconium. This definition shall not be construed as requiring that material containing metallic compounds be refined to a pure metal in order for the material to be considered a metallic mineral concentrate to be covered by the standards.
