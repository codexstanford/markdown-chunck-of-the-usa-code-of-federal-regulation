###### ยง 35.3565 Specific cash draw rules for authorized types of assistance from the Fund.
####### Aggressive leveraging.

(3)Where the cash draw rules in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section would significantly frustrate a State's leveraged program, EPA may permit an exception to these cash draw rules and provide for a more accelerated cash draw. A State must demonstrate that:

(i) There are eligible projects ready to proceed in the immediate future with enough costs to justify the amount of the secured bond issue;

(ii) The absence of cash on an accelerated basis will substantially delay these projects;

(iii) The Fund will provide substantially more assistance if accelerated cash draws are allowed; and

(iv) The long-term viability of the State program to meet drinking water needs will be protected.
