####### e

(e) Determine greenhouse gas pollutant emissions for plug-in hybrid engines and powertrains using the emissions results for all the transient duty cycle test intervals described in either paragraph (b) or (c) of appendix B of this part for both charge-depleting and charge-sustaining operation from paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Calculate the utility factor weighted composite mass of emissions from the charge-depleting and charge-sustaining test results,, as described in ยง 1036.510(e), replacing occurances of "SET" with "transient test interval". Note this results in composite FTP GHG emission results for plug-in hybrid engines and powertrains without the use of the cold-start and hot-start test interval weighting factors in Eq. 1036.512-1.

(f) Calculate and evaluate cycle statistics as specified in 40 CFR 1065.514 for nonhybrid engines and 40 CFR 1037.550 for hybrid engines and hybrid powertrains.
