(d)(1) An "administrative permit amendment" is a permit revision that:

(i) Corrects typographical errors;

(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;

(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;

(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority;

(v) Incorporates into the part 71 permit the requirements from preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA-approved program, provided that such a program meets procedural requirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of §§ 71.7 and 71.8 (and § 71.10 in the case of a delegated program) that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in § 71.6; or

(vi) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be similar to those in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.
