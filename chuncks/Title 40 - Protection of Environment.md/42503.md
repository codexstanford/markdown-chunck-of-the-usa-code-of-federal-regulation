(c)Whenever any portion of the flue gases from an affected unit can be routed through a bypass stack so as to avoid the installed SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain separate SOcontinuous emission monitoring systems and flow monitoring systems on the main stack and the bypass stack and calculate SOmass emissions for the unit as the sum of the SOmass emissions measured at the two stacks; or

(2) Monitor SOmass emissions at the main stack using SOand flow rate monitoring systems and measure SOmass emissions at the bypass stack using the reference methods in ยง 75.22(b) for SOand flow rate and calculate SOmass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions recorded by the installed monitoring systems on the main stack and the emissions measured by the reference method monitoring systems; or
