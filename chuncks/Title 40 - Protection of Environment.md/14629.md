(B) February 18, 2008, "Director's Final Findings and Orders", signed by Chris Korleski, Director, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

(ii) Additional material.

(A) An October 25, 2010, letter from Robert F. Hodanbosi, Chief Division of Air Pollution Control of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to Susan Hedman, Regional Administrator, containing documentation of noninterference, under section 110(l) of the Clean Air Act, of the less stringent applicability cutoff for sheet mold compound machines.

(155) On March 11, 2011, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted Ohio's regional haze plan addressing the first implementation period of the regional haze rule requirements. This plan includes a long-term strategy with emission limits for mandating emission reductions equivalent to the reductions from implement best available retrofit technology and with emission reductions to provide Ohio's contribution toward achievement of reasonable progress goals at Class I areas affected by Ohio. The plan specifically satisfies BART requirements for non-EGUs, most notably by providing new, tighter emission limits for the P.H. Glatfelter facility in Ross County, Ohio. The plan establishes a combined daily sulfur dioxide emission limit of 24,930 pounds per day for boiler #7 and #8. The plan also includes permit number P0103673 that will impose these emission limitations on P.H. Glatfelter Company.

(i) Incorporation by reference.

(156) On April 24, 2006, Ohio EPA submitted two permanent exemptions from the Permit to Install program and six Permit-by-Rule provisions for approval into its SIP. On July 18, 2008, Ohio EPA submitted provisions for a Permit to Install and Operate (PTIO) program and a general permit program for approval into its SIP. The changes to Ohio's SIP involve the modification of various parts of OAC 3745-31, the removal of OAC 3745-35, and the addition of OAC 3745-31-29 to enable the issuance of federally enforceable general PTIs and general PTIOs.
