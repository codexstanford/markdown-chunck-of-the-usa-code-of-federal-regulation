(4)(i)(A) The brake-specific exhaust NMHC or NOemissions in g/bhp-hr, as determined under § 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.5 times the applicable NMHC or NOemission standards or FELs specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

(B) For engines not having a NOFEL less than1.50 g/bhp-hr, the brake-specific NOand NMHC exhaust emissions in g/bhp-hr, as determined under § 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.25 times the applicable emission standards or FELs specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (or of § 86.004-11, as allowed by paragraph (g) of this section), during engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

(C) The brake-specific exhaust PM emissions in g/bhp-hr, as determined under § 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.5 times the applicable PM emission standards or FEL (for FELs above the standard only) specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

(D) The brake-specific exhaust CO emissions in g/bhp-hr, as determined under § 86.1370-2007 pertaining to the not-to-exceed test procedures, shall not exceed 1.25 times the applicable CO emission standards or FEL specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, during engine and vehicle operation specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section except as noted in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

(ii) For each engine family, the not-to-exceed emission limits must apply during one of the following two ambient operating regions:

(A) The not-to-exceed limits apply for all altitudes less than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea-level, during all ambient conditions (temperature and humidity). Temperature and humidity ranges for which correction factors are allowed are specified in § 86.1370-2007(e); or
