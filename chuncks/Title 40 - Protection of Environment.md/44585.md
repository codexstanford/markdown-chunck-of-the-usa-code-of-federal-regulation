(2) Reactor cracking;

(3) Gaseous/fume oxidation;

(4) Rotary kiln incineration;

(5) Cement kiln;

(6) Radio frequency plasma;

(7) Municipal waste incinerators (only for the destruction of foams);

(8) Nitrogen plasma arc;

(9) Portable plasma arc;

(10) Argon plasma arc;

(11) Chemical reaction with hydrogen and carbon dioxide;

(12) Inductively coupled radio frequency plasma;

(13) Microwave plasma;

(14) Porous thermal reactor;

(15) Gas phase catalytic de-halogenation;

(16) Superheated steam reactor; or

(17) Thermal reaction with methane.
