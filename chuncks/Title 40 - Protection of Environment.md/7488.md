(d)(1) To implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in an affected area 18 months from the date when the Administrator makes a finding under paragraph (c) of this section unless the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. To further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in an affected area 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For the findings under paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(4) of this section, the date of the finding shall be the effective date as defined in the final action triggering the sanctions clock.

(2)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the proposed or final disapproval occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and more than 24 months after the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part.

(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.

If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan.

If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency.

For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in thefully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in thefinding that the State is implementing the approved SIP.

(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies.
