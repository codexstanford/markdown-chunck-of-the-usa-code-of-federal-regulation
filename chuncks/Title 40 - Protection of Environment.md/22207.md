###### 8.2.6 Measurement System Response Time.

As described in section 8.2.5, you must determine the measurement system response time during the initial system bias (or 2-point system calibration error) check. Observe the times required to achieve 95 percent of a stable response for both the low-level and upscale gases. The longer interval is the response time.
