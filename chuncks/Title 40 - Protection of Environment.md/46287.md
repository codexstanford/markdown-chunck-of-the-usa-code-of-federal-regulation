####### VVT system.

(J)The manufacturer must perform a separate test for each malfunction limit established by the manufacturer for the monitoring required in paragraphs (g)(10)(ii)(A) and (g)(10)(ii)(B) of this section. In conducting the VVT system demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the VVT system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.

(K) For each of the testing requirements of this paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section, if the manufacturer has established that only a functional check is required because no failure or deterioration of the specific tested system could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the manufacturer is not required to perform a demonstration test; however, the manufacturer is required to provide the data and/or engineering analysis used to determine that only a functional test of the system(s) is required.
