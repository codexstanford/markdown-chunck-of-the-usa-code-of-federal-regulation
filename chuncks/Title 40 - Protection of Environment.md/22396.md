###### 13.15 Pre-extraction Standard Recovery.

Recoveries of all pre-extraction standard compounds added to the sample must be between 20 to 130% for PCDD/PCDF and PAH (see Tables 23-7 and 23-8 of this method) and between 20 to 145% for PCB (see Table 23-9 of this method). If the recovery criteria are not met, you may reanalyze the sample and/or prepare and analyze the archive sample. If the recovery criteria are still not met, the sampling run is not valid, and the stack test must be repeated.
