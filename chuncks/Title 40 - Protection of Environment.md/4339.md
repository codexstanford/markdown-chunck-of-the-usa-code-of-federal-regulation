###### Absorbance range.

11.3If the absorbance of the sample solution ranges between 1.0 and 2.0, the sample can be diluted 1:1 with a portion of the reagent blank and the absorbance redetermined within 5 minutes. Solutions with higher absorbances can be diluted up to sixfold with the reagent blank in order to obtain scale readings of less than 1.0 absorbance unit. However, it is recommended that a smaller portion (<10 mL) of the original sample be reanalyzed (if possible) if the sample requires a dilution greater than 1:1.
