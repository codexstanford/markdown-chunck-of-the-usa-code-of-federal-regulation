(146) On April 8, 2022, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request. WDNR updated chapters NR 404 and 484 of Wisconsin's ambient air quality rule to include the 2015 primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone and its incorporation by reference rule to add EPA-promulgated monitoring requirements related to the NAAQS. WDNR also revised sections of chapters NR 407 (Operation permits), 408 (Construction permits for direct major sources in nonattainment areas) and 428 (Control of Nitrogen Compounds) to ensure implementation of the ozone NAAQS in a manner consistent with Federal regulations.
