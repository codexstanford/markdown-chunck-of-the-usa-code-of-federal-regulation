####### Protection in the workplace.

(i)Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(ii), and (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent or reduce exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or other positive pressure mode and equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 2,000 meets the minimum requirements of § 721.63(a)(4). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.05 mg/m. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.
