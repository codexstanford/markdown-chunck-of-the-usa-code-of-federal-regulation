(3) The expression "max" generally refers to the absolute value of the reference value used during linearity verification that is furthest from zero. This is the value used to scale the first and third tolerances in Table 1 of this section usingand. For example, if the reference values chosen to validate a pressure transducer vary from -10 to -1 kPa, thenis +10 kPa. If the reference values used to validate a temperature device vary from 290 to 390 K, thenis 390 K. For gas dividers where "max" is expressed as,/;is the maximum gas concentration used during the verification,is the undivided, undiluted, span gas concentration, and the resulting ratio is the maximum divider point reference value used during the verification (typically 1). The following are special cases where "max" refers to a different value:
