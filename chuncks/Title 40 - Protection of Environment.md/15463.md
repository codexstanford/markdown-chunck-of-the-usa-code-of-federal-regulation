##### Appendix E to Part 52 - Performance Specifications and, Specification Test Procedures for Monitoring Systems for Effluent Stream Gas Volumetric Flow Rate
###### Principle.

1.1Effluent stream gas volumetric flow rates are sampled and analyzed by a continuous measurement system. To verify the measurement system performance, values obtained from the measurement system are compared against simultaneous values obtained using the reference method. These comparison tests will be performed to determine the relative accuracy, and drift of the measurement system over the range of operating conditions expected to occur during normal operation of the source. If the measurement system is such that the specified tests in section 5.1 for drift do not apply, those test procedures shall be disregarded.
