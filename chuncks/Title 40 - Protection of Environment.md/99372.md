###### ยง 1033.615 Voluntarily subjecting locomotives to the standards of this part.
####### Equipment excluded from the definition of "locomotive".

(a)(1) Manufacturers/remanufacturers of equipment that is excluded from the definition of "locomotive" because of its total power, but would otherwise meet the definition of locomotive may ask to have it considered to be a locomotive. To do this, submit an application for certification as specified in subpart C of this part, explaining why it should be considered to be a locomotive. If we approve your request, it will be deemed to be a locomotive for the remainder of its service life.

(2) In unusual circumstances, we may deem other equipment to be locomotives (at the request of the owner or manufacturer/remanufacturer) where such equipment does not conform completely to the definition of locomotive, but is functionally equivalent to a locomotive.
