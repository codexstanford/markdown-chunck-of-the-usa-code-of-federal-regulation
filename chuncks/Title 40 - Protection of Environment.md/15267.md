(ss)Approval-On December 3, 2021, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area to attainment of the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in eight years as required by the CAA. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2030 and 2035 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (Budgets) for the area. The 2030 Budgets for the area are 0.54 tons/day for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 0.85 tons/day for oxides of nitrogen (NO). The 2035 Budgets for the area are 0.47 tons/day for VOC and 0.75 tons/day for NO. Wisconsin also submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan to satisfy the Enhanced Inspection/Maintenance recertification for the 2008 ozone NAAQS requirements of the CAA.
