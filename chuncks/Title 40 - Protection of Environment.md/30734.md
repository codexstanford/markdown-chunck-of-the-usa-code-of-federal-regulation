() This paragraph describes procedures to calculate emissions if the final temperature to which the vessel contents are heated is 10 K below the boiling point of the HAP in the vessel, or lower. The owner or operator shall calculate the mass of HAP emitted per episode using either Equation 13 or 14 of this subpart. The moles of noncondensable gas displaced are calculated using Equation 15 of this subpart. The initial and final pressure of the noncondensable gas in the vessel shall be calculated using Equation 16 of this subpart. The average molecular weight of HAP in the displaced gas shall be calculated using Equation 17 of this subpart.
