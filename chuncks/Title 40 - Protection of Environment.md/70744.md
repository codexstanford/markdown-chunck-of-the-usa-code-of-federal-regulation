###### Preparation of oil.

4.3.2A medium weight crude oil, Alaska North Slope (ANS), is artificially weathered by heating to 521 &#xB0;F to remove the light end hydrocarbons prior to experimental start-up (ANS 521). The method is described in the Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 8708 "Crude Petroleum Oil-Determination of Distillation Characteristics Using 15 Theoretical Plates Columns" by the International Organization for Standardization (8). The ANS521 crude oil can be obtained from the National Environmental Technology Applications Center's (NETAC) Bioremediation Products Evaluation Center (BPEC), University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center, 615 William Pitt Way, Pittsburgh, PA, 15238, (412) 826-5511. The crude oil is heated to 190 &#xB0;C (374 &#xB0;F) under atmospheric pressure. The system is then cooled and placed under vacuum (or under an atmospheric pressure of 20 mm Hg) for the final distillation to an atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 272 &#xB0;C (521 &#xB0;F).
