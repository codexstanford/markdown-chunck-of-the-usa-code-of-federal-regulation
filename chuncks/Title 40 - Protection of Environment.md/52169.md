####### Reporting of 2011 emissions using scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations developed after February 29, 2012.

(iii)Facilities that are approved to use best available monitoring methods in 2011 for scoping speciations, emission factors, or emission characterizations for certain processes must submit, by March 31, 2013, revised 2011 emission estimates that reflect the scoping speciations, emission factors, and emission characterizations that are measured for those processes after February 29, 2012. If the operating scenario for 2011 is different from all of the operating scenarios for which emission factors are developed after February 29, 2012, use Equation L-23 at ยง 98.123(c)(3)(viii) to adjust the emission factor(s) or emission characterizations measured for the post-February 29, 2012 operating scenario(s) to account for the differences.
