###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements for Tire Cord Production Affected Sources
####### ยง 63.5997 How do I conduct tests and procedures for tire cord production affected sources?
######## Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in table 2 of this subpart, option 2.

(c)Use the equations in this paragraph (c) to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limits for tire cord production sources using the compliance alternatives described in ยง 63.5987(a) and (b).

(1) Determine the mass percent of each HAP in each coating according to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) Use Equation 3 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using coatings without using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 3 follows:

(3) Use Equation 4 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in table 2 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 4 follows:

(4) Each monthly calculation is a compliance demonstration for the purpose of this subpart.
