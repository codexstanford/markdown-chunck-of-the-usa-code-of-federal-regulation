####### Continuous compliance.

(B)For the first year of compliance, continuous compliance shall be based on a cumulative average monthly emission rate calculated each month based on the available monthly emission rate data points (e.g., 7 data points after 7 months of operation, 8 data points after 8 months of operation) beginning the first month after initial compliance is demonstrated. The first continuous compliance cumulative average monthly emission rate shall be calculated using the first 7 monthly average emission rate data points. After the first year of compliance, a 12-month rolling average monthly emission rate shall be calculated each month based on the previous 12 monthly emission rate data points. Continuous compliance shall be determined by comparing the cumulative average monthly emission rate or the 12-month rolling average monthly emission rate to the mass emission limit specified in ยง 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as appropriate.
