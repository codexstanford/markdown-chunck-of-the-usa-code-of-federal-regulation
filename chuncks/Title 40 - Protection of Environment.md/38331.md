####### Three-Level System Integrity Check.

4.1.1.3Perform the 3-level system integrity check using low, mid, and high-level calibration gas concentrations generated by a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg. If your Hg CEMS lacks an integrated elemental Hg gas generator, you may continue to use NIST-traceable oxidized Hg gases for the 7-day calibration error test (or the daily calibration error check) until such time as NIST-traceable compressed elemental Hg gas standards, at appropriate concentration levels, are available from gas vendors. Follow the same basic procedure as for the linearity check. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Calculate the system integrity error (SIE), as described in Table A-1 of this appendix. The SIE must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1 of this appendix.
