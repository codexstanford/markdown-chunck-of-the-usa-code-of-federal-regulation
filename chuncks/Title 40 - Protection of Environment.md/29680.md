means the collection of equipment and tanks configured for pickling metal in any form but usually in discrete shapes where the material is lowered in batches into a bath of acid solution, allowed to remain until the scale is dissolved, then removed from the solution, drained, and rinsed by spraying or immersion in one or more rinse tanks to remove residual acid.
