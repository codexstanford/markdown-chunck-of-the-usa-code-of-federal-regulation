(iii) If toxicologically significant alterations in the metabolic profile of the test chemical are observed through eitherorexperiments, characterization of the enzyme(s) involved (for example, Phase I enzymes such as isozymes of the Cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenase system, Phase II enzymes such as isozymes of sulfotransferase or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase, or any other relevant enzymes) may be requested. This information will help establish the relevance of the involved enzyme(s) to human risk, as it is known that certain isozymes are present in animal species which are not present in humans, and vice versa.
