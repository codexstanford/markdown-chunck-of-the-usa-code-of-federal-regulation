######## Corrective action.

(p)When a process parameter or add-on air pollution control device operating parameter deviates from the value or range established during the performance test and incorporated in the OM&M plan, the owner or operator must initiate corrective action. Corrective action must restore operation of the affected source or emission unit (including the process or control device) to its normal or usual mode of operation as expeditiously as practicable in accordance with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Corrective actions taken must include follow-up actions necessary to return the process or control device parameter level(s) to the value or range of values established during the performance test and steps to prevent the likely recurrence of the cause of a deviation.
