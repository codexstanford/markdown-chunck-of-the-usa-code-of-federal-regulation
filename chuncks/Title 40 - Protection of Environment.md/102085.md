####### Fuel line permeation.

(a)Nonmetal fuel lines must meet the permeation requirements for EPA Nonroad Fuel Lines or EPA Cold-Weather Fuel Lines as specified in 40 CFR 1060.102. These requirements apply starting in the 2012 model year, except that they apply starting in the 2013 model year for emission families involving small-volume emission families that are not used in cold-weather equipment. For fuel lines used in cold-weather equipment, you may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with these permeation standards through 2015 as described in ยง 1054.145(h).
