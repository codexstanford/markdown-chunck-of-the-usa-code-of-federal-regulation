####### Allowable emissions

means the emissions of a pollutant from an affected source determined by taking into account the most stringent of all applicable SIP emissions limits and the level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS and the production rate associated with the maximum rated capacity and hours of operation (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both).
