###### § 1033.505 Ambient conditions.

This section specifies the allowable ambient conditions (including temperature and pressure) under which testing may be performed to determine compliance with the emission standards of § 1068.101. Manufacturers/remanufacturers may ask to perform testing at conditions other than those allowed by this section. We will allow such testing provided it does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards. See §§ 1033.101 and 1033.115 for more information about the requirements that apply at other conditions.
