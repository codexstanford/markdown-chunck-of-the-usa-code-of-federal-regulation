######## Point source

means large, stationary (non-mobile), identifiable sources of emissions that release pollutants into the atmosphere. A point source is a facility that is a major source under 40 CFR part 70 for one or more of the pollutants for which reporting is required by ยง 51.15 (a)(1). This does not include the emissions of hazardous air pollutants, which are not considered in determining whether a source is a point source under this subpart. The minimum point source reporting thresholds are shown in Table 1 of Appendix A.
