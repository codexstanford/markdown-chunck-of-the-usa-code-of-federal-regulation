####### Liquid stream calculations.

(j)To demonstrate compliance with the mass flow rate, mass per megagram of ODP, and percent reduction requirements for liquid streams specified in ยง 63.446, the owner or operator shall use the following:

(1) The mass flow rates of total HAP or methanol entering and exiting the treatment process shall be calculated using the following equations:

(2) The mass of total HAP or methanol per megagram ODP shall be calculated using the following equation:

(3) The percent reduction of total HAP across the applicable treatment process shall be calculated using the following equation:

(4) Compounds that meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(4)(i) or (4)(ii) of this section are not required to be included in the mass flow rate, mass per megagram of ODP, or the mass percent reduction determinations.

(i) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below 1 part per million by weight; or

(ii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below the lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 part per million by weight.
