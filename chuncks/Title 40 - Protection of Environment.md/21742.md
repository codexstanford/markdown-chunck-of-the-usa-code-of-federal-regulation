(5) Calculate the value of the oil formation volume factor,, using the following equation with: the bottom hole temperature,(), determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; the gas gravity at separator pressure of 100 psig, &#x3B3;, calculated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; the dissolved GOR, Rs (scf/STBO), calculated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; the oil API gravity, &#x3B3;, at the well site; and the constants, C1, C2, and C3, found in Table B:

(6) Calculate the density of oil at the wellhead,

(7) Calculate the density of oil at bottom hole conditions,

(8) Calculate the density of oil in the well,
