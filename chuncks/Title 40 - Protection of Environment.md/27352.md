###### ยง 63.649 Alternative means of emission limitation: Connectors in gas/vapor service and light liquid service.
####### Connector inspection alternative.

(c)The owner or operator shall implement a program to monitor all accessible connectors in gas/vapor service that are 2.0 inches (nominal diameter) or greater and inspect all accessible connectors in light liquid service that are 2 inches (nominal diameter) or greater as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section. The program does not apply to inaccessible or unsafe-to-monitor connectors.

(1) Within 12 months after the phase III compliance date specified in ยง 63.640(h), all connectors in gas/vapor service shall be monitored using Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60 appendix A. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 1,000 parts per million.

(2) All connectors in light liquid service shall be inspected for leaks. A leak is detected if liquids are observed to be dripping at a rate greater than three drops per minute.

(3) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.

(4) If a leak is detected, connectors in gas/vapor service shall be monitored for leaks within the first 3 months after repair. Connectors in light liquid service shall be inspected for indications of leaks within the first 3 months after repair. A leak is detected if liquids are observed to be dripping at a rate greater than three drops per minute.

(5) After conducting the initial survey required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent monitoring at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(iii) of this section.

(i) If the percentage leaking connectors is 2.0 percent or greater, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once per year.

(ii) If the percentage leaking connectors is 1.0 percent or greater but less than 2.0 percent, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once every 2 years.

(iii) If the percentage leaking connectors is less than 1.0 percent, the owner or operator shall monitor or inspect, as applicable, the connectors once every 4 years.

(6) The percentage leaking connectors shall be calculated for connectors in gas/vapor service and for connectors in light liquid service. The data for the two groups of connectors shall not be pooled for the purpose of determining the percentage leaking connectors.

(i) The percentage leaking connectors shall be calculated as follows:

(ii) Nonrepairable connectors shall be included in the calculation of percentage leaking connectors the first time the connector is identified as leaking and nonrepairable. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable connectors up to a maximum of 1 percent per year of the total number of connectors in organic HAP service up to a maximum of 3 percent may be excluded from calculation of percentage leaking connectors for subsequent monitoring periods.

(iii) If the number of nonrepairable connectors exceeds 3 percent of the total number of connectors in organic HAP service, the number of nonrepairable connectors exceeding 3 percent of the total number shall be included in the calculation of the percentage leaking connectors.

(7) Physical tagging of the connectors to indicate that they are subject to the monitoring provisions is not required. Connectors may be identified by the area or length of pipe and need not be individually identified.
