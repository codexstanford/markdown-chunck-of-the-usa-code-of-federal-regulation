###### ยง 1051.305 How must I prepare and test my production-line vehicles or engines?
####### Damage during shipment.

(f)If shipping a vehicle or engine to a remote facility for production-line testing makes necessary an adjustment or repair, you must wait until after the initial emission test to do this work. We may waive this requirement if the test would be impossible or unsafe, or if it would permanently damage the vehicle or engine. Report to us, in your written report under ยง 1051.345, all adjustments or repairs you make on test vehicles or engines before each test.
