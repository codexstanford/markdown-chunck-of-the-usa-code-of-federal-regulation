####### EGR system monitoring conditions.

(iii)(A) The manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section must be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

(B) The manufacturer may disable temporarily the EGR monitor under conditions when monitoring may not be reliable (e.g., when freezing may affect performance of the system). To do so, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that the monitor is unreliable when such conditions exist.
