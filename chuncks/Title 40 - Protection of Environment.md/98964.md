####### Tissue distribution.

(ii)At the termination of the Tier 1 study, the following tissues should be collected and stored frozen: Liver, fat, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, spleen, whole blood, and residual carcass. If it is determined that a significant amount of the administered dose is unaccounted for in the excreta, then data on the percent of the total (free and bound) radioactive dose in these tissues as well as residual carcass will be requested. Additional tissues must be included if there is evidence of target organ toxicity from subchronic or chronic toxicity studies. For other routes of exposure, specific tissues may also be required, such as lungs in inhalation studies and skin in dermal studies. Certain techniques currently at various stages of development, e.g., quantitative whole-body autoradiography, may prove useful in determining if a test substance concentrates in certain organs or in determining a specific pattern of distribution within a given tissue. The use of such techniques is encouraged, but not required, and may be employed to limit the number of tissues collected to those shown to contain a measurable amount of radioactivity.
