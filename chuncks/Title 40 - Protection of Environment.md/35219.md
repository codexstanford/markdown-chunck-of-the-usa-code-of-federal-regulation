######## Determine the volume of each material used.

(d)Determine the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month by measurement or usage records.

Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, 1C, and 2 of this section.
