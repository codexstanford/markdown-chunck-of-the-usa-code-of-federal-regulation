####### Production-weighted NO,average

means the manufacturer's production-weighted average NOemission level, for certification purposes, of all of its light-duty truck engine families included in the NOaveraging program. It is calculated at the end of the model year by multiplying each family NOemission limit by its respective production, summing those terms, and dividing the sum by the total production of the effected families. Those vehicles produced for sale in California or at high altitude shall each be averaged separately from those produced for sale in any other area.
