(3) Perform a least-squares regression of, versus, by calculating slope,, and intercept,, as described in 40 CFR 1065.602.

(4) Repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for every speed that you run your PDP.

(5) The following example illustrates a range of typical values for different PDP speeds:

(6) For each speed at which you operate the PDP, use the appropriate regression equation from this paragraph (a) to calculate flow rate during emission testing as described in ยง 1066.630.
