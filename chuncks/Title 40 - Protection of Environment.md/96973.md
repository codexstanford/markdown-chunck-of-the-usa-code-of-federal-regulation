####### ii,Test performance.

()The assay shall be performed using the desiccator method described as follows: The agar overlay plates shall be placed uncovered in a 9-liter desiccator. A volume of the liquid test substance shall be added to the glass Petri dish suspended beneath the porcelain shelf of the desiccator. The highest exposure concentration should not result in a vapor concentration which exceeds the lower explosive limit of commercial hexane. A magnetic stirring bar to serve as a fan to assure rapid and even distribution of the vapor shall be placed on the bottom of the inside of the desiccator. The desiccator shall be placed on a magnetic stirrer within a 37 &#xB0;C room or chamber for 7 to 10 hours. The plates shall then be removed, their lids replaced, followed by incubation for an additional 40 hours at 37 &#xB0;C before counting. An appropriate selective medium with an adequate overlay agar shall be used. All plating should be done in at least triplicate.
