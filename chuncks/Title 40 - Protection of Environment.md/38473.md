####### i.e.,

7.1.9.5 The test dates and times, reference method readings and corresponding PM CEMS responses (including the units of measure), and the calculated results for all PM CEMS correlation tests, RRAs and RCAs. For the correlation tests, you must indicate which model is used (linear, logarithmic, exponential, polynomial, or power) and record the correlation equation. For the RRAs and RCAs, the reference method readings and PM CEMS responses must be reported in the same units of measure as the PM CEMS correlation;

7.1.9.6 The cycle time and sample delay time for PM CEMS that operate in batch sampling mode; and

7.1.9.7 Supporting information for all required PM CEMS correlation tests, RRAs, and RCAs, including records of all raw reference method and monitoring system data, the results of sample analyses to substantiate the reported test results, as well as records of sampling equipment calibrations, reference monitor calibrations, and analytical equipment calibrations.

7.1.10 For stack gas flow rate, diluent gas, and moisture monitoring systems, you must keep records of all certification, recertification, diagnostic, and on-going quality-assurance tests of these systems, as specified in 40 CFR 75.59(a) of this chapter.
