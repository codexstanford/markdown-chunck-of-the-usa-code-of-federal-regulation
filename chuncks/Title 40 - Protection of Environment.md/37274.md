(iii) ASTM D3960-98 (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14).

(3) You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in ยง 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.

(4) You may rely on formulation data from raw material suppliers if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for the HAP listed in Table 11 to this subpart, and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. If the HAP weight percent estimated based on formulation data conflicts with the results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, then there is a rebuttal presumption that the test results are accurate unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the test results are not accurate and that the formulation data are more appropriate.
