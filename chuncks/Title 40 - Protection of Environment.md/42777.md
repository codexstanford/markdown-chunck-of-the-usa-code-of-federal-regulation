####### Periodic relative accuracy test audits, appendix E retests, and low mass emissions unit retests.

(5)The owner or operator or designated representative of an affected unit shall submit written notice of the date of periodic relative accuracy testing performed under section 2.3.1 of appendix B to this part, of periodic retesting performed under section 2.2 of appendix E to this part, and of periodic retesting of low mass emissions units performed under ยง 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(D), no later than 21 days prior to the first scheduled day of testing. Testing may be performed on a date other than that already provided in a notice under this subparagraph as long as notice of the new date is provided either in writing or by telephone or other means acceptable to the respective State agency or office of EPA, and the notice is provided as soon as practicable after the new testing date is known, but no later than twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the new date of testing.

(i) Written notification under paragraph (a) (5) of this section may be provided either by mail or by facsimile. In addition, written notification may be provided by electronic mail, provided that the respective State agency or office of EPA agrees that this is an acceptable form of notification.

(ii) Notwithstanding the notice requirements under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator may elect to repeat a periodic relative accuracy test, appendix E restest, or low mass emissions unit retest immediately, without additional notification whenever the owner or operator has determined that a test was failed, or that a second test is necessary in order to attain a reduced relative accuracy test frequency.
