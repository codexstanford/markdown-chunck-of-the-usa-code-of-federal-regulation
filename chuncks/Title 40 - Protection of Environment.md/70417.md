###### Migration components.

4.0.1Evaluate the surface water migration pathway based on two migration components:

- Overland/flood migration to surface water (see section 4.1).

- Ground water to surface water migration (see section 4.2).

Score one or both components, considering their relative importance. If only one component is scored, assign its score as the surface water migration pathway score. If both components are scored, select the higher of the two scores and assign it as the surface water migration pathway score.
