####### Rotary spin

means a process used to produce wool fiberglass building insulation by forcing molten glass through numerous small orifices in the side wall of a spinner to form continuous glass fibers that are then broken into discrete lengths by high-velocity air flow. Any process used to produce bonded wool fiberglass building insulation by a process other than flame attenuation is considered rotary spin.
