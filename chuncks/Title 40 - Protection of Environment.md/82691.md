####### Protection in the workplace.

(2) The significant new uses are: (i)Requirements as specified in § 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2)(i) (There must be no permeation of the substance greater than 0.02 µg/min &#xB7; cmafter 8 hours of testing in accordance with the most current version of the American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM F739 "Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases." For conditions of exposure which are intermittent, gloves may be tested in accordance with the most current version of ASTM F1383 "Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases Under Conditions of Intermittent Contact," provided the contact time in testing is greater than or equal to the expected duration of dermal contact, and the purge time used in testing is less than or equal to the expected duration of noncontact during the intermittent cycle of dermal exposure in the workplace. If ASTM F1383 is used for testing, manufacturers, importers, and processors must submit to the Agency a description of worker activities involving the substance which includes daily frequencies and durations of potential worker exposures. The results of all glove permeation testing must be reported in accordance with the most current version of ASTM F1194 "Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing Materials." Manufacturers, importers, and processors must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. The following gloves have been tested in accordance with the ASTM F739 method and found by EPA to satisfy the requirements for continuous use: Ansell Edmont/15-554/PVA, 0.08 cm thick; and Ansell Edmont/4h/PE/EVOH/PE laminate gloves, 0.006 cm thick. Gloves may not be used for a time period longer than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of each work shift. The following gloves have been tested in accordance with the ASTM 1383 method and found by EPA to satisfy the requirements for intermittent use: North/B-161-R/Butyl rubber gloves, 0.04 cm thick, time period tested 2 min/h. The gloves listed may not be used for a time period longer than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of each work shift unless based on its review of data from the ASTM 1383 method, the company's personal protective equipment required under this paragraph, and other appropriate information, the Agency approves, in writing, a time period of greater duration.), (a)(2)(ii) (With the exception of laboratory activities, full body chemical protective clothing is required for any worker activity in which the substance is reasonably likely to contact the worker in the following state(s): Open liquid pool or solid of greater than 5 kg; liquid spray or splash; mist; aerosol dust; or any worker activity which has the potential for contact with the substance for more than 10 min/h. At a minimum, a chemical protective apron is required for any worker activity with potential for contact with the substance which is not covered by this paragraph), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5)(iii) (if cartridge service life testing is not available), (a)(5)(xii) or (a)(5)(xiii) (if data on cartridge service life testing has been reviewed and approved in writing by EPA), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(iv), and (a)(6)(v). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and processors may use the New Chemical Exposure Limits provisions, including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been approved by EPA for this substance, found in the 5(e) consent order for this substance.
