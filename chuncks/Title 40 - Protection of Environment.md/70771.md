###### Statistical analysis.

4.7The determination of a bioremediation agent's effectiveness will be partially based upon the results of a statistical analysis of the shaker flask experiment. The experimental design for this test is a two factorial design. This two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine data trends. The statistical method is designed to test various types of bioremediation treatments including microbial, nutrient, enzyme, and combination products. The following is a summary of the statistical methods to be used to evaluate the analytical data obtained from all product tests. The experimental design, data analysis methodology, interpretation of results, required documentation, and a numeric example are outlined below.
