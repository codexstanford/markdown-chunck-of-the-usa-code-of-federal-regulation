##### Appendix B to Part 75 - Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures
###### e.g.,

(6) For all multi-level flow audits, the audit points at adjacent load levels or at adjacent operating levels (mid and high) shall be separated by no less than 25.0 percent of the "range of operation," as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part.

(d) A RATA of a moisture monitoring system shall be performed whenever the coefficient, K factor or mathematical algorithm determined under section 6.5.7 of appendix A to this part is changed.

The owner or operator may perform as many RATA attempts as are necessary to achieve the desired relative accuracy test audit frequencies and/or bias adjustment factors. However, the data validation procedures in section 2.3.2 of this appendix must be followed.

(a) A RATA shall not commence if the monitoring system is operating out-of-control with respect to any of the daily and quarterly quality assurance assessments required by sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this appendix or with respect to the additional calibration error test requirements in section 2.1.3 of this appendix.

(b) Each required RATA shall be done according to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section:

(1) The RATA may be done "cold," i.e., with no corrective maintenance, repair, calibration adjustments, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitoring system prior to the test.
