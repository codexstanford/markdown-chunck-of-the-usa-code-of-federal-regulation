####### Knowledge of the wastewater.

(1)The owner or operator may use knowledge of the wastewater stream and/or the process to determine the annual average flow rate. The owner or operator shall use the maximum expected annual average production capacity of the process unit, knowledge of the process, and/or mass balance information to either: Estimate directly the annual average wastewater flow rate; or estimate the total annual wastewater volume and then divide total volume by 525,600 minutes in a year. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
