#### PART 77 - EXCESS EMISSIONS
##### § 77.6 Penalties for excess emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

(a)(1) If excess emissions of sulfur dioxide occur at the affected source or nitrogen oxide occur at an affected unit during any year, the owners and operators respectively of the affected source and the affected units at the source or of the affected unit shall pay, without demand, an excess emissions penalty, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) If one or more affected units governed by an approved NOaveraging plan under § 76.11 of this chapter fail (after applying § 76.11(d)(1)(ii)(C) of this chapter) to meet their respective alternative contemporaneous emission limitations or annual heat input limits, then excess emissions of nitrogen oxides occur during the year at each such unit. The sum of the excess emissions of nitrogen oxides of such units shall equal the amount determined under § 76.13(b) of this chapter. The owners and operators of such units shall pay an excess emissions penalty, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section using the sum of the excess emissions of nitrogen oxides of such units.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), payment under paragraphs (a) (1) or (2) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator by 30 days after the date on which the Administrator serves the designated representative a notice that the process of recordation set forth in § 73.34(a) of this chapter is completed or by July 1 of the year after the year in which the excess emissions occurred, whichever date is earlier. Payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any increase in excess emissions of sulfur dioxide determined after adjustments made under § 72.91(b) of this chapter shall be submitted to the Administrator by 30 days after the date on which the Administrator serves the designated representative a notice that process set forth in § 72.91(b) of this chapter is completed.
