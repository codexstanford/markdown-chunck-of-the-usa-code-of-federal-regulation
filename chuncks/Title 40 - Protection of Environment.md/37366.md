###### Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.8232 What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits?
######## i.e.,

(ii) The outlet temperature of the gas stream for the final (the farthest downstream) cooling system when no control devices other than coolers or demisters are used;

(iii) The outlet temperature of the gas stream from the final cooling system when the cooling system is followed by a molecular sieve or regenerative carbon adsorber;

(iv) Outlet concentration of available chlorine, pH, liquid flow rate, and inlet gas temperature of chlorinated brine scrubbers and hypochlorite scrubbers;

(v) The liquid flow rate and exit gas temperature for water scrubbers;

(vi) The inlet gas temperature of regenerative carbon adsorption systems; and

(vii) The temperature during the heating phase of the regeneration cycle for carbon adsorbers or molecular sieves.

(2) To establish a maximum monitoring value or minimum monitoring value, as appropriate for your final control device, you must average the recorded parameters in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section over the test period. If your final control device is a regenerative carbon adsorber, you must use the highest temperature reading measured in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) as the reference temperature in ยง 63.8244(b)(2)(v).

(g) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test specified in this section, you must submit the results of the performance test following the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
