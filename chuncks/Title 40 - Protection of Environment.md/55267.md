###### Calculation of a Baseline BAF from an Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient.

G.A baseline BAF for trophic level 3 and a baseline BAF for trophic level 4 shall be calculated from a Kof acceptable quality and a FCM using the following equation:

Baseline BAF = (FCM) (predicted baseline BCF) = (FCM) (K)

A. To calculate human health and wildlife BAFs for an organic chemical, the Kof the chemical shall be used with a POC concentration of 0.00000004 kg/L and a DOC concentration of 0.000002 kg/L to yield the fraction freely dissolved:

B. The human health BAFs for an organic chemical shall be calculated using the following equations:

For trophic level 3:

For trophic level 4:

0.0182 and 0.0310 are the standardized fraction lipid values for trophic levels 3 and 4, respectively, that are used to derive human health criteria and values for the GLI.

C. The wildlife BAFs for an organic chemical shall be calculated using the following equations:

For trophic level 3:

For trophic level 4:

0.0646 and 0.1031 are the standardized fraction lipid values for trophic levels 3 and 4, respectively, that are used to derive wildlife criteria for the GLI.

A. For inorganic chemicals, the baseline BAFs for trophic levels 3 and 4 are both assumed to equal the BCF determined for the chemical with fish, i.e., the FCM is assumed to be 1 for both trophic levels 3 and 4. However, a FCM greater than 1 might be applicable to some metals, such as mercury, if, for example, an organometallic form of the metal biomagnifies.
