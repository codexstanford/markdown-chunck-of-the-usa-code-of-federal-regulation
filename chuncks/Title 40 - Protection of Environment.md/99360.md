###### ยง 1033.535 Adjusting emission levels to account for infrequently regenerating aftertreatment devices.

For locomotives using aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration events that may occur during testing, take one of the following approaches to account for the emission impact of regeneration:

(a) You may use the calculation methodology described in 40 CFR 1065.680 to adjust measured emission results. Do this by developing an upward adjustment factor and a downward adjustment factor for each pollutant based on measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency as follows:

(1) Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but you may develop separate adjustment factors for different configurations within an engine family. Use the adjustment factors from this section for all testing for the engine family.

(2) You may use carryover or carry-across data to establish adjustment factors for an engine family as described in ยง 1033.235, consistent with good engineering judgment.
