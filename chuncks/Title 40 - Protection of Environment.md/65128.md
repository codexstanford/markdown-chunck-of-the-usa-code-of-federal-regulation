###### Operating Criteria
####### § 257.82 Hydrologic and hydraulic capacity requirements for CCR surface impoundments.

(a) The owner or operator of an existing or new CCR surface impoundment or any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment must design, construct, operate, and maintain an inflow design flood control system as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The inflow design flood control system must adequately manage flow into the CCR unit during and following the peak discharge of the inflow design flood specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(2) The inflow design flood control system must adequately manage flow from the CCR unit to collect and control the peak discharge resulting from the inflow design flood specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(3) The inflow design flood is:

(i) For a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, as determined under § 257.73(a)(2) or § 257.74(a)(2), the probable maximum flood;

(ii) For a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, as determined under § 257.73(a)(2) or § 257.74(a)(2), the 1,000-year flood;

(iii) For a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, as determined under § 257.73(a)(2) or § 257.74(a)(2), the 100-year flood; or

(iv) For an incised CCR surface impoundment, the 25-year flood.

(b) Discharge from the CCR unit must be handled in accordance with the surface water requirements under § 257.3-3.
