####### Test procedures,Animal selection,Species and strain.

(d)-(1)-(i)Testing shall be performed on two mammalian species. Rats and mice are the species of choice because of their relatively short life spans, limited cost of maintenance, widespread use in pharmacological and toxicological studies, susceptibility to tumor induction, and the availability of inbred or sufficiently characterized strains. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be used. If other mammalian species are used, the tester shall provide justification/reasoning for their selection.
