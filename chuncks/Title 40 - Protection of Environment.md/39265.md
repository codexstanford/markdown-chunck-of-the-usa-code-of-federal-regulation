######## Transfer rack

means the system used to load organic liquids into tank trucks and railcars at a single geographic site. It includes all loading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and equipment necessary for the transfer operation. Transfer equipment that are physically separate (i.e., do not share common piping, valves, and other equipment) are considered to be separate transfer racks.
