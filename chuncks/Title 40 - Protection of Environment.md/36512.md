###### Appendix A to Subpart ZZZZ of Part 63 - Protocol for Using an Electrochemical Analyzer to Determine Oxygen and Carbon Monoxide Concentrations From Certain Engines
####### 3.12 Performance-Established Configuration.

The EC cell and sampling system configuration that existed at the time that it initially met the performance requirements of this protocol.

When present in sufficient concentrations, NO and NOare two gas species that have been reported to interfere with CO concentration measurements. In the likelihood of this occurrence, it is the protocol user's responsibility to employ and properly maintain an appropriate CO EC cell filter or scrubber for removal of these gases, as described in Section 6.2.12.

The system must maintain the gas sample at conditions that will prevent moisture condensation in the sample transport lines, both before and as the sample gas contacts the EC cells. The essential components of the measurement system are described below.
