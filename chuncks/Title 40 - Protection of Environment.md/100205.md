###### ยง 1037.526 Aerodynamic measurements for trailers.
####### C,A

(1) Determine a baselinevalue for a standard tractor pulling a test trailer representing a production configuration; use a 53-foot test trailer to represent long trailers and a 28-foot test trailer to represent short trailers. Repeat this testing with the same tractor and the applicable baseline trailer. For testing long trailers, the baseline trailer is a trailer meeting the specifications for a Phase 1 standard trailer in ยง 1037.501(g)(1); for testing refrigerated box vans, use a baseline trailer with an installed HVAC unit that properly represents a baseline configuration correlated with the production configuration. For testing short trailers, use a 28-foot baseline trailer with a single axle that meets the same specifications as the Phase 1 standard trailer, except as needed to accommodate the reduced trailer length.

(2) Use good engineering judgment to perform paired tests that accurately demonstrate the reduction in aerodynamic drag associated with the improved design. For example, the gap dimension should be the same for all paired tests, and effective yaw angle between paired tests should differ by no more than 1.0&#xB0;.
