(f)Hresponse factor determination. This procedure is only for FID analyzers that measure THC. Since FID analyzers generally have a different response to CHthan CH, determine the THC-FID analyzer's CHresponse factor,after FID optimization using the procedure described in paragraph (d) of this section, replacing CHwith CH. Use the most recentmeasured according to this section in the calculations for HC determination described in ยง 1065.660 to compensate for CHresponse.
