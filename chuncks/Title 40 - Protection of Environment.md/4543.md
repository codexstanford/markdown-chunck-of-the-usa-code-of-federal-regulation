####### Artifacts.

6.2Positive errors in PMconcentration measurements may result from retention of gaseous species on filters.Such errors include the retention of sulfur dioxide and nitric acid. Retention of sulfur dioxide on filters, followed by oxidation to sulfate, is referred to as artifact sulfate formation, a phenomenon which increases with increasing filter alkalinity.Little or no artifact sulfate formation should occur using filters that meet the alkalinity specification in section 7.2.4. Artifact nitrate formation, resulting primarily from retention of nitric acid, occurs to varying degrees on many filter types, including glass fiber, cellulose ester, and many quartz fiber filters.Loss of true atmospheric particulate nitrate during or following sampling may also occur due to dissociation or chemical reaction. This phenomenon has been observed on Teflon &#xAE; filtersand inferred for quartz fiber filters.The magnitude of nitrate artifact errors in PMmass concentration measurements will vary with location and ambient temperature; however, for most sampling locations, these errors are expected to be small.
