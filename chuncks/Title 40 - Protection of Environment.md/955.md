###### building,exclusively

If the facility is a building, the statute requires that it be exclusively devoted to pollution control. Most questions as to whether a facility is aand, if so, whether it isdevoted to pollution control are resolved by ยง 1.169-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Department regulations.

Since a treatment facility is eligible only if it furthers the general policies of the United States under the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, a facility will be certified only if its purpose is to improve the quality of the air or water outside the plant. Facilities to protect the health or safety of employees inside the plant are not eligible.

Facilities installed before January 1, 1976, in plants placed in operation after December 31, 1968, are ineligible for certification under the statute. 26 U.S.C. 169.
