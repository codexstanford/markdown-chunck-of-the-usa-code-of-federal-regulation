###### § 63.1008 Connectors in gas and vapor service and in light liquid service standards.
####### Inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors.

(2)(i) Any connector that is inaccessible or that is ceramic or ceramic-lined (e.g., porcelain, glass, or glass-lined), is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the leak repair requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 63.1017 and 63.1018. An inaccessible connector is a connector that meets any of the provisions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (d)(2)(i)(F) of this section, as applicable.

(A) Buried;

(B) Insulated in a manner that prevents access to the connector by a monitor probe;

(C) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the connector by a monitor probe; or

(D) Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic-type scaffold that would allow access to connectors up to 7.6 meters (25 feet) above the ground.

(E) Inaccessible because it would require elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a permanent support surface or would require the erection of scaffold;

(F) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical lines, or would risk damage to equipment.

(ii) If any inaccessible ceramic or ceramic-lined connector is noted to have a leak by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means, the leak to the atmosphere shall be eliminated as soon as practical.
