####### incomplete vehicle

(ii) Anis a vehicle that is not a complete vehicle. Incomplete vehicles may also be cab-complete vehicles. This may include vehicles sold to secondary vehicle manufacturers.

(iii) The primary use of the terms "complete vehicle" and "incomplete vehicle" are to distinguish whether a vehicle is complete when it is first sold as a vehicle.

(iv) You may ask us to allow you to certify a vehicle as incomplete if you manufacture the engines and sell the unassembled chassis components, as long as you do not produce and sell the body components necessary to complete the vehicle.
