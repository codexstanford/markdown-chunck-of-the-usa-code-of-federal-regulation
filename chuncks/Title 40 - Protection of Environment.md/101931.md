###### ยง 1051.610 What provisions apply to vehicles already certified under the motor vehicle program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new recreational vehicles into commerce if the vehicle is already certified to the requirements that apply under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. If you comply with all of the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the engine under this part 1051 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1051. This section applies especially for highway motorcycles that are modified for recreational nonroad use. See ยง 1051.605 for similar provisions that apply to motor-vehicle engines or Large SI engines produced for recreational vehicles.
