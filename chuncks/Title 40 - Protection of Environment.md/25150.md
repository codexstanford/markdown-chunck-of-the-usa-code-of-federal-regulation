####### Methods for determining compliance.

(2)(i) The Administrator will determine compliance with opacity and visible emission standards in this part based on the results of the test method specified in an applicable subpart. Whenever a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) is required to be installed to determine compliance with numerical opacity emission standards in this part, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by using the results from the COMS. Whenever an opacity emission test method is not specified, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 9 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter or the method specified in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section. Whenever a visible emission test method is not specified, compliance with visible emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) If an affected source undergoes opacity or visible emission testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard if-

(A) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted within a reasonable amount of time before a performance test is required to be conducted under the relevant standard;

(B) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;

(C) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted and the resulting data were reduced using EPA-approved test methods and procedures, as specified in ยง 63.7(e); and

(D) The opacity or visible emission test was appropriately quality-assured, as specified in ยง 63.7(c) of this section.
