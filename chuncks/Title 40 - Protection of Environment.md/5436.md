() Reasonable notice is given to the reviewing authority prior to the relocation identifying the proposed new location and the probable duration of operation at the new location. Such notice shall be given to the reviewing authority not less than 10 days in advance of the proposed relocation unless a different time duration is previously approved by the reviewing authority.

(2) The plan may provide that requirements equivalent to those contained in paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section do not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates that, as to that pollutant, the source or modification is located in an area designated as nonattainment under section 107 of the Act. Nonattainment designations for revoked NAAQS, as contained in part 81 of this chapter, shall not be viewed as current designations under section 107 of the Act for purposes of determining the applicability of requirements equivalent to those contained in paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section to a major stationary source or major modification after the revocation of that NAAQS is effective.

(3) The plan may provide that requirements equivalent to those contained in paragraphs (k), (m), and (o) of this section do not apply to a proposed major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant, if the allowable emissions of that pollutant from a new source, or the net emissions increase of that pollutant from a modification, would be temporary and impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated.

(4) The plan may provide that requirements equivalent to those contained in paragraphs (k), (m), and (o) of this section as they relate to any maximum allowable increase for a Class II area do not apply to a modification of a major stationary source that was in existence on March 1, 1978, if the net increase in allowable emissions of each a regulated NSR pollutant from the modification after the application of best available control technology would be less than 50 tons per year.

(5) The plan may provide that the reviewing authority may exempt a proposed major stationary source or major modification from the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section, with respect to monitoring for a particular pollutant, if:

(i) The emissions increase of the pollutant from a new stationary source or the net emissions increase of the pollutant from a modification would cause, in any area, air quality impacts less than the following amounts:
