###### § 266.100 Applicability.
####### bona fide

(ii) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit bytreatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

(3) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a lead or nickel-chromium or mercury recovery furnace (except for owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP) or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must provide a one-time written notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying whether the owner or operator claims an exemption for each waste under this paragraph or paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owners or operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for those wastes claimed to be exempt under that paragraph and must comply with the requirements below for those wastes claimed to be exempt under this paragraph (d)(3).

(i) The hazardous wastes listed in appendices XI, XII, and XIII, part 266, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that:

(A) A waste listed in appendix XI of this part must contain recoverable levels of lead, a waste listed in appendix XII of this part must contain recoverable levels of nickel or chromium, a waste listed in appendix XIII of this part must contain recoverable levels of mercury and contain less than 500 ppm of 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII organic constituents, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing must contain recoverable levels of metal; and

(B) The waste does not exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic of § 261.24 of this chapter for an organic constituent; and

(C) The waste is not a hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter because it is listed for an organic constituent as identified in appendix VII of part 261 of this chapter; and

(D) The owner or operator certifies in the one-time notice that hazardous waste is burned under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and that sampling and analysis will be conducted or other information will be obtained as necessary to ensure continued compliance with these requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted according to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and records to document compliance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be kept for at least three years.

(ii) The Director may decide on a case-by-case basis that the toxic organic constituents in a material listed in appendix XI, XII, or XIII of this part that contains a total concentration of more than 500 ppm toxic organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, may pose a hazard to human health and the environment when burned in a metal recovery furnace exempt from the requirements of this subpart. In that situation, after adequate notice and opportunity for comment, the metal recovery furnace will become subject to the requirements of this subpart when burning that material. In making the hazard determination, the Director will consider the following factors:

(A) The concentration and toxicity of organic constituents in the material; and

(B) The level of destruction of toxic organic constituents provided by the furnace; and

(C) Whether the acceptable ambient levels established in appendices IV or V of this part may be exceeded for any toxic organic compound that may be emitted based on dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration.

(e) The standards for direct transfer operations under § 266.111 apply only to facilities subject to the permit standards of § 266.102 or the interim status standards of § 266.103.

(f) The management standards for residues under § 266.112 apply to any boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste.

(g) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces) that process hazardous waste for recovery of economically significant amounts of the precious metals gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, or ruthenium, or any combination of these are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.112. To be exempt from §§ 266.101 through 266.111, an owner or operator must:

(1) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:

(i) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;

(ii) The hazardous waste is burned for legitimate recovery of precious metal; and

(iii) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph; and

(2) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste as necessary to document that the waste contains economically significant amounts of the metals and that the treatment recovers economically significant amounts of precious metal; and

(3) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document that all hazardous wastes burned are burned for recovery of economically significant amounts of precious metal.

(h) Starting June 23, 1997, owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that process hazardous waste for recovery of lead and that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP, are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for § 266.101. To be exempt, an owner or operator must provide a one-time notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying that the owner or operator claims an exemption under this paragraph. The notice also must state that the waste burned has a total concentration of non-metal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter of less than 500 ppm by weight, as fired and as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or is listed in appendix XI to this part 266.
