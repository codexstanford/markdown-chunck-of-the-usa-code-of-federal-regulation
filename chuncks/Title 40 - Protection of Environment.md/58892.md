###### ยง 158.2110 Microbial pesticides data requirements.
####### For all microbial pesticides.

(a)(1) The following ยง 158.2120 through ยง 158.2150 identify the data requirements that are required to support registration of microbial pesticides. The variations in the test conditions are identified within the test notes.

(2) Each data table includes "use patterns" under which the individual data are required, with variations including all use patterns, food and nonfood uses for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, forestry, and residential outdoor applications under certain circumstances.

(3) The categories for each data requirement are "R," which stands for required, and "CR" which stands for conditionally required. If a bracket appears around the "R" or "CR," the data are required for both the registration and experimental use permit requests. Generally, "R" indicates that the data are more likely required than for those data requirements with "CR." However, in each case, the regulatory text preceding the data table and the test notes following the data table must be used to determine whether the data requirement must be satisfied.
