###### ยง 761.347 First level sampling - waste from existing piles.
####### Collecting samples from more than one pile.

(1)If the PCB bulk product waste or PCB remediation waste consists of more than one pile or container, assign each pile or container an integer number and then generate seven random integer numbers to select the piles from which you will collect samples. It is possible that this random selection procedure will result in selecting the same pile number more than once, even if seven or more piles are present. If so, sample the pile once and restart the sampling collection process to collect additional samples. Do not collect multiple samples from the same location in the pile.
