###### § 63.6 Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
####### Conduct of opacity or visible emission observations.

(5)When a relevant standard under this part includes an opacity or visible emission standard, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the following:

(i) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required in § 63.7 unless one of the following conditions applies:

(A) If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which a new or reconstructed source will be operated, but not later than 120 days after initial startup of the source, or within 120 days after the effective date of the relevant standard in the case of new sources that start up before the standard's effective date. If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 120 days after the compliance date for an existing or modified source; or

(B) If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 63.7, or within the time period specified in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the source's owner or operator shall reschedule the opacity or visible emission observations as soon after the initial performance test, or time period, as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. The rescheduled opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted under § 63.7. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance with procedures contained in Test Method 9 or Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.

(ii) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, the minimum total time of opacity observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance test or other required set of observations (e.g., for fugitive-type emission sources subject only to an opacity emission standard).

(iii) The owner or operator of an affected source to which an opacity or visible emission standard in this part applies shall conduct opacity or visible emission observations in accordance with the provisions of this section, record the results of the evaluation of emissions, and report to the Administrator the opacity or visible emission results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(d).

(iv) [Reserved]

(v) Opacity readings of portions of plumes that contain condensed, uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determining compliance with opacity emission standards.
