###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from as found measurements of manifolded groups of reciprocating compressor sources.

(8)For manifolded groups of compressor sources measured according to paragraph (p)(1)(iii) of this section, you must calculate annual GHG emissions using Equation W-29B of this section. If the reciprocating compressors included in the manifolded group of compressor sources share the manifold with centrifugal compressors, you must follow the procedures in either this paragraph (p)(8) or paragraph (o)(8) of this section to calculate emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources.
