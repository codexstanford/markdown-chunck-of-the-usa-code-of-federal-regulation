###### Emission Limitations
####### § 63.4291 What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
######## Emission rate with add-on controls option.

(3)Demonstrate that, based on the dyeing and finishing materials applied in the dyeing/finishing operation(s) and the organic HAP emissions reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the dyeing/finishing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, calculated as a rolling 12-month average emission rate. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all capture systems and control devices for the dyeing/finishing operation(s) meet the operating limits required in § 63.4292, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4341(f)(5), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.4293. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.4340 through 63.4342 and 63.4360 through 63.4364 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
