####### Unauthorized State Amendments.

(4)

(i) The State's adoption of the Federal rules listed in the following table is not approved by the EPA and is therefore, not enforceable:

(ii) In the New Mexico's Program Revision Application package for RCRA Clusters XIII through XVIII, the State indicates that it is seeking authorization for breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps under the universal waste program, in order to reduce their volume to facilitate management or transport to destination facilities (see 75 FR 65432, Oct. 25, 2010). However, EPA did not authorize the breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps. The Agency needs further analysis to determine if the breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps will be authorized as part of the State's authorized program. Therefore, in this codification notice EPA has determined to exclude the lamp crushing provisions from this codification.
