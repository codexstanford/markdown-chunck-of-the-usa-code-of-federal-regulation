####### Exhaust gas sensor.

(G)The manufacturer must perform a test with all primary exhaust gas sensors used for fuel control simultaneously possessing a response rate deteriorated to the malfunction criteria limit specified in paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(A) of this section. The manufacturer must also perform a test for any other primary or secondary exhaust gas sensor parameter under parargraphs (h)(8)(ii)(A) and (h)(8)(iii)(A) of this section that can cause engine emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds (e.g., shift in air/fuel ratio at which oxygen sensor switches, decreased amplitude). When performing additional test(s), all primary and secondary (if applicable) exhaust gas sensors used for emission control must be operating at the malfunction criteria limit for the applicable parameter only. All other primary and secondary exhaust gas sensor parameters must be operating with normal characteristics.
