######### Procedure.
########## Measurement principles.

(b)HO and COcan negatively interfere with a CLD's NOresponse by collisional quenching, which inhibits the chemiluminescent reaction that a CLD utilizes to detect NO. This procedure and the calculations in ยง 1065.675 determine quench and scale the quench results to the maximum mole fraction of HO and the maximum COconcentration expected during emission testing. If the CLD analyzer uses quench compensation algorithms that utilize HO and/or COmeasurement instruments, evaluate quench with these instruments active and evaluate quench with the compensation algorithms applied.
