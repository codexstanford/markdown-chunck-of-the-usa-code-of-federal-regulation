(b)Submittal from the State of Georgia, through the Georgia's Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division (EPD) on January 13, 2011, that would allow for the automatic rescission of federal permitting-related requirements in certain circumstances. EPA is disapproving a portion of the SIP submittal related to a provision (at 391-3-1-.02(7)(a)(2)(iv)) that would automatically rescind portions of Georgia's State Implementation Plan in the wake of certain court decisions or other triggering events (the automatic rescission clause).
