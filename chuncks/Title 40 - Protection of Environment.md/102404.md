### Subchapter U - Air Pollution Controls
#### PART 1060 - CONTROL OF EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS FROM NEW AND IN-USE NONROAD AND STATIONARY EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart G - Special Compliance Provisions
###### ยง 1060.601 How do the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101 apply with respect to the requirements of this part?
####### Applicability of standards after January 1, 2020.

(2)Starting January 1, 2020, it is presumed that replacement components will be used with nonroad engines regulated under this part if they can reasonably be used with such engines. Manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and importers are therefore obligated to take reasonable steps to ensure that any uncertified components are not used to replace certified components. This would require labeling the components and may also require restricting the sales and requiring the ultimate purchaser to agree to not use the components inappropriately. This paragraph (b)(2) does not apply for components that are clearly not intended for use with fuels.
