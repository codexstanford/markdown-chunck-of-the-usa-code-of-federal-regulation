####### Vapor-tight marine vessel

means a marine vessel with a benzene product tank that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to have no leaks. This demonstration shall be made using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A, during the last 20 percent of loading and during a period when the vessel is being loaded at its maximum loading rate. A reading of greater than 10,000 ppm as methane shall constitute a leak. As an alternative, a marine vessel owner or operator may use the vapor-tightness test described in ยง 61.304(f) to demonstrate vapor tightness. A marine vessel operated at negative pressure is assumed to be vapor-tight for the purpose of this standard.
