(b) Determine the amount of water remaining downstream of a sample dryer and at the concentration measurement using one of the methods described in ยง 1065.145(e)(2). If you use a sample dryer upstream of an analyzer and if the calculated amount of water remaining downstream of the sample dryer and at the concentration measurement,, is higher than the amount of water at the flow meter,, setequal to. If you use a sample dryer upstream of storage media, you must be able to demonstrate that the sample dryer is removing water continuously (is higher thanthroughout the test interval).
