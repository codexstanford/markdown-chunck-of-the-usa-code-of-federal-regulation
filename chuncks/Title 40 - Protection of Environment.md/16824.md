###### Monitoring Spatial Scales.

4.4.4 SO(a) The appropriate spatial scales for SOSLAMS monitors are the microscale, middle, neighborhood, and urban scales. Monitors sited at the microscale, middle, and neighborhood scales are suitable for determining maximum hourly concentrations for SO. Monitors sited at urban scales are useful for identifying SOtransport, trends, and, if sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.
