####### Exceptions to performance tests.

(b)An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test when a combustion, recovery, or recapture device specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section is used to comply with ยง 63.1425(b), (c), or (d).

(1) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater.

(2) A boiler or process heater where the process vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.

(3) A combustion, recovery, or recapture device for which a performance test was conducted within the preceding 5-year period, using the same Methods specified in this section and either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. The operating parameters reported under the previous performance test shall be sufficient to meet the parameter monitoring requirements in this subpart.

(4) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:

(i) Has been issued a final hazardous waste permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements for hazardous waste burned in boilers and industrial furnaces in 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or

(ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements for hazardous waste burned in boilers and industrial furnaces in of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.

(5) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements for incinerators in 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements for incinerators in 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.

(6) Combustion, recovery or recapture device (except for condensers) performance may be determined by using the design evaluation described in paragraph (f) of this section, provided that the combustion, recovery or recapture device receives less than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from one or more PMPUs, determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. If a combustion, recovery or recapture device exempted from testing in accordance with this paragraph receives more than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from one or more PMPUs, the owner or operator shall comply with the performance test requirements in paragraph (c) of this section and shall submit the test report in the next Periodic Report.
