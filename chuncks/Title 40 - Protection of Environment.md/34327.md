######## Control device efficiency.,e.g.,

(i)Continuously monitor the gas stream entering and exiting the control device to determine the total organic volatile matter mass flow rate (by determining the concentration of the vent gas in grams per cubic meter and the volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per second such that the total organic volatile matter mass flow rate in grams per second can be calculated) such that the control device efficiency of the control device can be calculated for each month using Equation 2 of ยง 63.3360.
