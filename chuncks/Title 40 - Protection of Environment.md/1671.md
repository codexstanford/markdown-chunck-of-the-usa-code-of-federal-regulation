(a) Notwithstanding the requirements of 2 CFR parts 200 and 1500, EPA may reimburse recipients for pre-award costs incurred from the beginning of the budget period established in the grant agreement if such costs would have been allowable if incurred after the award. Pre-award costs must be identified in the grant application EPA approves.
