(i)If the test substance is administered by gavage, the animals are dosed with the test substance on a 7-day per week basis for a period of at least 18 months for mice and hamsters and 24 months for rats.

If the test substance is administered in the drinking water or mixed in the diet, then exposure should be on a 7-day per week basis.
