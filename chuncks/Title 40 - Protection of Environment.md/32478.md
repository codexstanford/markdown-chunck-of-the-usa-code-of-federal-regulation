###### ยง 63.1428 Process vent requirements for group determination of PMPUs using a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product.
####### Process vents from batch unit operations.

(a)The owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU located at an affected source, if the combination of all process vents from batch unit operations that are associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product is a Group 1 combination of batch process vents, as defined in ยง 63.1423. The annual uncontrolled nonepoxide organic HAP emissions, determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and annual average flow rate, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall be determined for all process vents from batch unit operations associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product, with the exception of those vents specified in paragraph (i) of this section, at the location after all applicable control techniques have been applied to reduce epoxide emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) If the owner or operator is using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at the exit of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.

(2) If the owner or operator is using ECO to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at the exit from the batch unit operation. For the purpose of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation column shall be considered part of the unit operation.
