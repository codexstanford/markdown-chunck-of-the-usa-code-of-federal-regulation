####### Determination of Attainment:

(g)Effective August 24, 2016, the EPA has determined that, based on 2011 to 2013 ambient air quality data, the South Coast PMnonattainment area has attained the 1997 annual and 24-hour PMNAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 1997 annual and 24-hour PMNAAQS. If the EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 1997 PMNAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for the area shall be withdrawn.
