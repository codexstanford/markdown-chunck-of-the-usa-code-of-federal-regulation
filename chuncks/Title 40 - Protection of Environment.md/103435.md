####### Percent

(%) means a representation of exactly 0.01. Numbers expressed as percentages in this part (such as a tolerance of +/-2%) have infinite precision, so 2% and 2.000000000% have the same meaning. This means that where we specify some percentage of a total value, the calculated value has the same number of significant digits as the total value. For example, 2% of a span value where the span value is 101.3302 is 2.026604.
