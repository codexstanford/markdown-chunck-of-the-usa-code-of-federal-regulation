####### Adding a PMPU to a plant site.

(1)The provisions of paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that adds one or more PMPUs to a plant site. A PMPU may be added to a plant site by constructing or reconstructing a process unit to produce polyether polyols. A PMPU may also be added to a plant site due to changes in production (anticipated production or actual past production) such that a polyether polyol becomes the primary product of a process unit that was not previously a PMPU.

(i) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, the added group of one or more PMPUs and their associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later, if the added group of one or more PMPUs meets the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and either meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section.

(A) The process units are new process units, as defined in ยง 63.1423.

(B) The added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) or more of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year (22.7 megagrams per year) or more of any combination of organic HAP, and polyether polyols are currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source.

(C) A polyether polyol is not currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source, and the plant site meets, or after the addition is constructed will meet, the General Provisions' definition of a major source in ยง 63.2.

(ii) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, and the added group of one or more PMPUs does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and one of the criteria specified in either paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the definition of a major source, the owner or operator of the added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall comply with the requirements for an existing affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 1, 2002; or by 6 months after notifying the Administrator that a process unit has been designated as a PMPU (in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section), whichever is later.
