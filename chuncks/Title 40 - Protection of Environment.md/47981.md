##### Subpart S - General Compliance Provisions for Control of Air Pollution From New and In-Use Light-Duty Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Vehicles
###### ยง 86.1829-01 Durability and emission testing requirements; waivers.
####### Testing at low altitude.

(i)One EDV in each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/refueling emission control system combination must be tested in accordance with the evaporative/refueling test procedure requirement of subpart B of this part. The configuration of the EDV will be determined under the provisions of ยง 86.1828-01. The EDV must also be tested for exhaust emission compliance using the FTP and SFTP procedures of subpart B of this part. In lieu of testing natural gas or hydrogen fueled vehicles to demonstrate compliance with the evaporative and refueling emission standards specified in this subpart, a manufacturer may provide a statement in its application for certification that, based on the manufacturer's engineering evaluation of appropriate testing and/or design parameters, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles comply with applicable emission standards. This same testing exemption applies for vehicles fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, except that refueling tests are required for systems that allow venting during the refueling operation.
