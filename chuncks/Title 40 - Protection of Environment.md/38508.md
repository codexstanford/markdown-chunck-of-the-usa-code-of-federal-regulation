17In accordance with 40 CFR 63.7(e)(3), a test is defined as three or more runs of one or more EPA Reference Method(s) conducted to measure the amount of a specific regulated pollutant, pollutants, or surrogates being emitted from a particular EGU (or group of EGUs that share a common stack), and to satisfy requirements of this subpart. On or after January 1, 2024, you must report the data elements in sections 17 and 18, each time that you complete a required performance stack test, RATA, PM CEMS correlation, RRA, or RCA at the affected EGU(s), using EPA test Method 5, 5B, 5D, 6C, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B. You must also report the applicable data elements in sections 19 through 25 of this appendix for each test. If any separate, corresponding EPA test Method 2, 3A, or 4 test is conducted in order to convert a pollutant concentration to the units of the applicable emission standard given in Table 1 or Table 2 of this subpart or to convert pollutant concentration from wet to dry basis (or vice-versa), you must also report the applicable data elements in sections 26 through 31 of this appendix.
