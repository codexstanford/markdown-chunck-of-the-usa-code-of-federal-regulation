###### ยง 144.55 Corrective action.
####### Class III wells only.

(4)When setting corrective action requirements the Director shall consider the overall effect of the project on the hydraulic gradient in potentially affected USDWs, and the corresponding changes in potentiometric surface(s) and flow direction(s) rather than the discrete effect of each well. If a decision is made that corrective action is not necessary based on the determinations above, the monitoring program required in ยง 146.33(b) shall be designed to verify the validity of such determinations.
