####### Facilities,Apparatus.,1,2,3,4

(2)-(i)(A) Facilities which may be needed to perform this test include: () flow-through or recirculating tanks for holding and acclimating mysids; () a mechanism for controlling and maintaining the water temperature during the holding, acclimation and test periods; () apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing gas bubbles, or aerating the water, as necessary; and () an apparatus for providing a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod with a 15- to 30-minute transition period. In addition, flow-through chambers and a test substance delivery system are required. It is recommended that mysids be held in retention chambers within test chambers to facilitate observations and eliminate loss through outflow water.

(B) Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and disturbances that may affect test organisms.

(C) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
