####### Ranges of fuel economy and CO,emission values

(h). We will determine the range of combined fuel economy and COemission values for each vehicle class identified in ยง 600.315. We will generally update these range values before the start of each model year based on the lowest and highest values within each vehicle class. We will also use this same information to establish a range of fuel economy values for all vehicles. Continue to use the most recently published numbers until we update them, even if you start a new model year before we publish the range values for the new model year.
