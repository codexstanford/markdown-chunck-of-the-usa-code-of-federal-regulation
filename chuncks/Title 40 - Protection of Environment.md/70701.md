2.4.2.3 If one or more of the standard oil extracts do not meet this linear-stability criterion, then the "offending" standard(s) can be prepared a second time (, extraction of the specified amount of oil from 30-ml or seawater for the "offending" standard according to the pretest preparation procedure). If replacement of the reanalyzed standard solution(s) in the standard curve meets the linear-stability criterion (, no RF >20% different from the overall mean), then analysis of sample extracts can begin.

2.4.2.4 If the initial-stability criterion is still not satisfied, analysis of sample extract cannot begin and the source of the problem (e.g., preparation protocol for the oil standards, spectrophotometer stability, etc.) must be corrected.

2.4.2.5 The initial six-point calibration of the UV-visible spectrophotometer at the oil concentrations identified is required at least once per test day.
