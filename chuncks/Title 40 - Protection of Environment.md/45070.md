5.7.1The acidity test uses the titration principle to detect any compound that is soluble in water and ionizes as an acid. The test method shall be that described in(incorporated by reference, see ยง 82.168). This test may not be suitable for determination of high molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found in the high boiling residue test outlined in Section 5.8. The test requires a 50 to 60 gram sample and has a detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight calculated as HCl.
