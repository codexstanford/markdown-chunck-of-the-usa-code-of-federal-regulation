####### § 63.7333 How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations that apply to me?

(a) For each control device applied to pushing emissions and subject to the emission limit in § 63.7290(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Maintaining emissions of particulate matter at or below the applicable limits in paragraphs § 63.7290(a)(1) through (4); and

(2) Conducting subsequent performance tests to demonstrate continuous compliance no less frequently than twice during each term of your title V operating permit (at mid-term and renewal).

(b) For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions and subject to the operating limits in § 63.7290(b)(1), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Maintaining the daily average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate at levels no lower than those established during the initial or subsequent performance test.

(2) Operating and maintaining each CPMS according to § 63.7331(b) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements.

(3) Collecting and reducing monitoring data for pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate according to § 63.7331(e)(1) through (3).

(c) For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions and subject to the operating limits in § 63.7290(b)(2), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Maintaining the daily average water pressure and temperature at levels no lower than those established during the initial or subsequent performance test.

(2) Operating and maintaining each CPMS according to § 63.7331(b) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements.

(3) Collecting and reducing monitoring data for water pressure and temperature according to § 63.7331(f).

(d) For each capture system applied to pushing emissions and subject to the operating limit in § 63.7290(b)(3), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by meeting the requirements in paragraph (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section:

(1) If you elect the operating limit for volumetric flow rate in § 63.7290(b)(3):

(i) Maintaining the daily average volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the control device at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test; and

(ii) Checking the volumetric flow rate at least every 8 hours to verify the daily average is at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test and recording the results of each check.

(2) If you elect the operating limit for fan motor amperes in § 63.7290(b)(3)(i):

(i) Maintaining the daily average fan motor amperages at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test; and

(ii) Checking the fan motor amperage at least every 8 hours to verify the daily average is at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test and recording the results of each check.

(3) If you elect the operating limit for static pressure or fan RPM in § 63.7290(b)(3)(ii):

(i) Maintaining the daily average static pressure at the inlet to the control device at an equal or greater vacuum than established during the initial or subsequent performance test or the daily average fan RPM at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test; and

(ii) Checking the static pressure or fan RPM at least every 8 hours to verify the daily average static pressure at the inlet to the control device is at an equal or greater vacuum than established during the initial or subsequent performance test or the daily average fan RPM is at or above the minimum level established during the initial or subsequent performance test and recording the results of each check.

(e) Beginning on the first day compliance is required under § 63.7283, you must demonstrate continuous compliance for each by-product coke oven battery subject to the opacity limit for stacks in § 63.7296(a) by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Maintaining the daily average opacity at or below 15 percent for a battery on a normal coking cycle or 20 percent for a battery on batterywide extended coking; and

(2) Operating and maintaining a COMS and collecting and reducing the COMS data according to § 63.7331(j).

(f) Beginning on the first day compliance is required under § 63.7283, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the TDS limit for quenching in § 63.7295(a)(1)(i) by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Maintaining the TDS content of the water used to quench hot coke at 1,100 mg/L or less; and

(2) Determining the TDS content of the quench water at least weekly according to the requirements in § 63.7325(a) and recording the sample results.

(g) Beginning on the first day compliance is required under § 63.7283, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the constituent limit for quenching in § 63.7295(a)(1)(ii) by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Maintaining the sum of the concentrations of benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene in the water used to quench hot coke at levels less than or equal to the site-specific limit approved by the permitting authority; and

(2) Determining the sum of the constituent concentrations at least monthly according to the requirements in § 63.7325(c) and recording the sample results.

(h) For each multicyclone applied to pushing emissions and subject to the operating limit in § 63.7290(b)(4), you must demonstrate compliance by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Maintaining the daily average pressure drop at a level at or below the level established during the initial or subsequent performance test.

(2) Operating and maintaining each CPMS according to § 63.7331(k) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements.

(3) Collecting and reducing monitoring data for pressure drop according to § 63.7331(e)(1) through (3).
