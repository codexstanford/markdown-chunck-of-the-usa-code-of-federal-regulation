####### Liability.

(c)Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR part 1039. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers that use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new engines and vessels; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations in this chapter during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 1068.
