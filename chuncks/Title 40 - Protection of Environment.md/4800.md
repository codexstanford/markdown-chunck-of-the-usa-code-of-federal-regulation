###### i.e.,

(c) The daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentration for a given day is the highest of the 17 consecutive 8-hour averages beginning with the 8-hour period from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and ending with the 8-hour period from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. the following day (the 8-hour averages for 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.). Daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentrations shall be determined for each day with ambient Omonitoring data, including days outside the Omonitoring season if those data are available.

(d) A daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentration shall be considered valid if valid 8-hour averages are available for at least 13 of the 17 consecutive 8-hour periods starting from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. In addition, in the event that fewer than 13 valid 8-hour averages are available, a daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentration shall also be considered valid if it is greater than the level of the NAAQS. Hourly Oconcentrations that have been approved under ยง 50.14 as having been affected by exceptional events shall be included when determining whether these criteria have been met.

(e) The primary and secondary Odesign value statistic is the annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour Oconcentration, averaged over three years, expressed in ppm. The fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour Oconcentration for each year shall be determined based only on days meeting the validity criteria in 3(d). The 3-year average shall be computed using the three most recent, consecutive years of ambient Omonitoring data. Design values shall be reported in ppm to three decimal places, with additional digits to the right of the third decimal place truncated.
