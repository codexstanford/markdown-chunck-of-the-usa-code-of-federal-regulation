###### ยง 141.82 Description of corrosion control treatment requirements.
####### Step 3.,optimal corrosion control treatment

(3)Water systems shall evaluate the results of the monitoring conducted under this paragraph (j)(3) to determine if either localized or centralized adjustment of theor other distribution system actions are necessary and submit the recommendation to the State within six months after the end of the tap sampling period in which the site(s) exceeded the lead action level. Corrosion control treatment modification may not be necessary to address every exceedance. Other distribution system actions may include flushing to reduce water age. Water systems must note the cause of the elevated lead level, if known from the site assessment, in their recommendation to the State as site-specific issues can be an important factor in why the system is not recommending any adjustment of corrosion control treatment or other distribution system actions. Systems in the process of optimizing or re-optimizing optimal corrosion control treatment under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section do not need to submit a treatment recommendation for find-and-fix.
