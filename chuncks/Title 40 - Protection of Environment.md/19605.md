###### § 60.705 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to § 60.702 shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.702 (§ 60.702 (a), (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial start-up required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.702 with which he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as specified by § 60.704 no later than 180 days from initial start-up.

(b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the following data measured during each performance test, and also include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used or where the reactor process vent stream is introduced as the primary fuel to any size boiler or process heater to comply with § 60.702(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.705(b)(2)(i) is required. The same data specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a combustion device, outlet concentration of TOC, or the TRE index value of a vent stream from a recovery system is determined.

(1) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.702(a) through use of either a thermal or catalytic incinerator:

(i) The average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing, and

(ii) The percent reduction of TOC determined as specified in § 60.704(b) achieved by the incinerator, or the concentration of TOC (ppmv, by compound) determined as specified in § 60.704(b) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.

(2) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.702(a) through use of a boiler or process heater:

(i) A description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater, and

(ii) The average combustion temperature of the boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing.

(3) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.702(b) through use of a smokeless flare, flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted or nonassisted), all visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test, continuous records of the flare pilot flame monitoring, and records of all periods of operations during which the pilot flame is absent.

(4) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.702(c):

(i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter which is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation, if approved by the Administrator), and average exit temperature, of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or

(ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or

(iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total steam mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance test (full carbon bed cycle), temperature of the carbon bed after regeneration [and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle(s)], and duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle (all measured while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally); or

(iv) As an alternative to § 60.705(b)(4) (i), (ii) or (iii), the concentration level or reading indicated by the organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

(v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.

(c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.703 (a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion device is used to comply with § 60.702(a), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:

(1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.702(a) was determined.

(2) For catalytic incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature of the vent stream immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average temperature of the vent stream during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.702(a) was determined. The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the bed during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.702(a) was determined.

These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating value, and E. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8. The facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.702 or § 60.700(d). If the facility chooses to comply with § 60.702, the facility may qualify for an exemption under § 60.700(c)(2), (4), or (8).

(6) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under § 60.705(g).

A record of the serial number of the car-seal or a record to show that the key to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out must be maintained to demonstrate the period, the duration, and frequency in which the bypass line was operated.

(8) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the vent stream concentration above the low concentration exemption level in § 60.700(c)(8), including a measurement of the new vent stream concentration, as recorded under § 60.705(j). These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. If the vent stream concentration is above 300 ppmv as measured using Method 18 or above 150 ppmv as measured using Method 25A, a performance test must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating value, and E. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption provisions listed in § 60.700(c), except for the TRE index greater than 8.0 exemption in § 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.702.
