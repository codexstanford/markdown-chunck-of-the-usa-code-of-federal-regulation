####### Testing of used oil fuel.

(2)Used oil to be burned for energy recovery is presumed to contain quantifiable levels (2 ppm) of PCB unless the marketer obtains analyses (testing) or other information that the used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable levels of PCBs.

(i) The person who first claims that a used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable level (2 ppm) PCB must obtain analyses or other information to support that claim.

(ii) Testing to determine the PCB concentration in used oil may be conducted on individual samples, or in accordance with the testing procedures described in ยง 761.60(g)(2). However, for purposes of this part, if any PCBs at a concentration of 50 ppm or greater have been added to the container or equipment, then the total container contents must be considered as having a PCB concentration of 50 ppm or greater for purposes of complying with the disposal requirements of this part.

(iii) Other information documenting that the used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable levels (2 ppm) of PCBs may consist of either personal, special knowledge of the source and composition of the used oil, or a certification from the person generating the used oil claiming that the oil contains no detectable PCBs.
