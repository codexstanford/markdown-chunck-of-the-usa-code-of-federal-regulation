###### ยง 141.600 General requirements.

(a) The requirements of subpart U of this part constitute national primary drinking water regulations. The regulations in this subpart establish monitoring and other requirements for identifying subpart V compliance monitoring locations for determining compliance with maximum contaminant levels for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and haloacetic acids (five)(HAA5). You must use an Initial Distribution System Evaluation (IDSE) to determine locations with representative high TTHM and HAA5 concentrations throughout your distribution system. IDSEs are used in conjunction with, but separate from, subpart L compliance monitoring, to identify and select subpart V compliance monitoring locations.
