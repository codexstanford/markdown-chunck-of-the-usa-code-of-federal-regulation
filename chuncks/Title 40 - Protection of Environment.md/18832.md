(A) 2.6 kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids from BC/CC topcoats, and 1.47 kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids from all other topcoat coatings; or

(B) 1.47 kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids from all topcoat coatings.

(iii) Commencing on the day after the expiration of the period described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) and continuing thereafter, emissions of VOC's from each topcoat operation shall not exceed 1.47 kilograms of VOC per liter of applied coating solids as specified under § 60.392(c) of this subpart.
