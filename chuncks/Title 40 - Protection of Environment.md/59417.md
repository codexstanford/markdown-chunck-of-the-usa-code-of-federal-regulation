####### For all existing containment structures, what construction materials must I use?

(a)These are the material specifications for an existing containment structure:

(1) The containment structure must be constructed of steel, reinforced concrete or other rigid material capable of withstanding the full hydrostatic head, load and impact of any pesticides, precipitation, other substances, equipment and appurtenances placed within the structure. The structure must be liquid-tight with cracks, seams and joints appropriately sealed.

(2) The structure must not be constructed of natural earthen material, unfired clay, or asphalt.

(3) The containment structure must be made of materials compatible with the pesticides stored. In this case, compatible means able to withstand anticipated exposure to stored or transferred substances and still provide containment of those same or other substances within the containment area.
