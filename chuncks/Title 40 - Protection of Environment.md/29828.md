######## 3

() If construction of the kiln commenced after April 19, 1996 at a plant site where a cement kiln (whether burning hazardous waste or not) did not previously exist, hydrocarbons are limited to 50 parts per million by volume, over a 30-day block average (monitored continuously with a continuous monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane.

(6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 86 parts per million, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) Particulate matter in excess of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed and opacity greater than 20 percent.

(i) You must use suitable methods to determine the kiln raw material feedrate.

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, you must compute the particulate matter emission rate, E, from the equation specified in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.

(iii) If you operate a preheater or preheater/precalciner kiln with dual stacks, you must test simultaneously and compute the combined particulate matter emission rate, E, from the equation specified in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.
