() If a recovery device was added as part of a pollution prevention project, the percent reduction shall be demonstrated by conducting a performance test at the inlet and outlet of that recovery device.

(B) For a Group 2 continuous process vent controlled using a technology with an approved nominal efficiency greater than 98 percent or a pollution prevention measure achieving greater than 98 percent reduction, use Equation 38 of this subpart.

(iv) Emissions from Group 2 continuous process vents at baseline shall be calculated as follows:

(A) If the continuous process vent was uncontrolled on November 15, 1990, ECPV2= ECPV2and shall be calculated according to the procedures and equation for ECPVin paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

(B) If the continuous process vent was controlled on November 15, 1990, use Equation 39 of this subpart.
