###### ยง 1060.601 How do the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101 apply with respect to the requirements of this part?

(a) As described in ยง 1060.1, fuel tanks and fuel lines that are used with or intended to be used with new nonroad engines or equipment are subject to evaporative emission standards under this part. This includes portable marine fuel tanks and fuel lines and other fuel-system components associated with portable marine fuel tanks. Note that ยง 1060.1 specifies an implementation schedule based on the date of manufacture of nonroad equipment, so new fuel tanks and fuel lines are not subject to standards under this part if they will be installed for use in equipment built before the specified dates for implementing the appropriate standards, subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, fuel-system components that are subject to permeation or diurnal emission standards under this part must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity before being introduced into U.S. commerce to avoid violating the prohibition of 40 CFR 1068.101(a). To the extent we allow it under the exhaust standard-setting part, fuel-system components may be certified with a family emission limit higher than the specified emission standard.

(b) New replacement fuel tanks and fuel lines must meet the requirements of this part 1060 if they are intended to be used with nonroad engines or equipment regulated under this part 1060, as follows:
