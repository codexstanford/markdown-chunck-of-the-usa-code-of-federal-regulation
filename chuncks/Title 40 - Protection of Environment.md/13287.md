(k)The LDEQ submitted a maintenance plan addressing the 1997 8-hour ozone standard for the New Orleans Ozone Maintenance Area on June 29, 2007. This area is designated unclassifiable/attainment for the 1997 ozone standard. EPA determined this request for the New Orleans Ozone Maintenance Area was complete on August 8, 2007. This maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the CAA, and is consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the New Orleans Ozone Maintenance Area including the parishes of Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard and St. Charles on September 16, 2008.
