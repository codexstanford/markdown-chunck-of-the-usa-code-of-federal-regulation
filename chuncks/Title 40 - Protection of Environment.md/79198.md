(i)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.63(a)(4), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for ยง 721.63(a)(4) engineering control measures (enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following NIOSH-certified respirators with an APF of at least 50 meet the requirements of ยง 721.63(a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; NIOSH-certified supplied-air respirator operated in positive pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood, or helmet or tight-fitting facepiece. As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for these substances. The NCEL is 0.1 mg/mas an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.
