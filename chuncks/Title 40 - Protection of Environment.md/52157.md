(4)If a destruction device used to destroy fluorinated GHG is subject to subpart EEE of part 63 of this chapter or any portion of parts 260-270 of this chapter, you may apply the destruction efficiency specifically determined for CF, SF, PFCs other than CF, and all other fluorinated GHGs under that test if the testing meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iv) of this section. If the testing of the destruction efficiency under subpart EEE of part 63 of this chapter was conducted more than 10 years ago, you may use the most recent destruction efficiency test provided that the design, operation, or maintenance of the destruction device has not changed since the last destruction efficiency test in a manner that could affect the ability to achieve the destruction efficiency, and the hazardous waste is fed into the normal flame zone.
