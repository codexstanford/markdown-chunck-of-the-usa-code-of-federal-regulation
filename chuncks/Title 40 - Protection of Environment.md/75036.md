3.3 Operators shall first calculate the mass of each NAF-cuttings sample and perform the mass ratio analysis (Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part). Operators with only one NAF-cuttings discharge may skip this step (Section 4.c.4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).

3.4 Operators shall homogenize (e.g., stirring, shaking) each NAF-cuttings sample prior to placing a sub-sample into the retort cup. The bottom of the NAF-cuttings sample container shall be examined to be sure that solids are not sticking to it.
