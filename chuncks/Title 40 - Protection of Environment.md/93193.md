####### Chemical identity information.

(g)For substances exempt under paragraph (e) of this section the manufacturer must to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer identify the following and maintain the records in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section:

(1) A specific chemical name and CAS Registry Number (or EPA assigned Accession Number) for each "reactant," as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of this section, used at any weight in the manufacture of the polymer. For purposes of determining chemical identity, the manufacturer may determine whether a reactant is used at greater than two weight percent according to either the weight of the reactant charged to the reaction vessel or the weight of the chemically combined (incorporated) reactant in the polymer. Manufacturers who choose the "incorporated" method must have analytical data, or theoretical calculations (if it can be documented that an analytical determination cannot be made or is not necessary), to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph. Reactants that introduce into the polymer elements, properties, or functional groups that would render the polymer ineligible for the exemption are not allowed at any level.

(2) A representative structural diagram, if possible.
