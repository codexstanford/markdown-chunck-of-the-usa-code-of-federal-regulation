####### Release to water.

(i)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 770 parts per billion (ppb) for the aggregate of the PMN substances, P-11-619 and P-11-620). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4), the statement that the amount of the substances that will be released will be calculated before the substances enter control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substances will be treated before release, then the amount of the substances reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 90 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.

(ii) [Reserved]
