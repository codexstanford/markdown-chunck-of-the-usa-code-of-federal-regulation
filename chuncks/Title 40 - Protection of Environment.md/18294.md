####### Secondary emission control system

means the combination of equipment used for the capture and collection of secondary emissions (e.g.,

(1) An open hood system for the capture and collection of primary and secondary emissions from the BOPF, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device such as a baghouse for the capture and collection of emissions from the hot metal transfer and skimming station; or

(2) An open hood system for the capture and collection of primary and secondary emissions from the furnace, plus a furnace enclosure with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for additional capture and collection of secondary emissions from the furnace, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for the capture and collection of emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming station; or

(3) A furnace enclosure with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device such as a baghouse for the capture and collection of secondary emissions from a BOPF controlled by a closed hood primary emission control system, with local hooding ducted to a secondary emission collection device, such as a baghouse, for the capture and collection of emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming stations).
