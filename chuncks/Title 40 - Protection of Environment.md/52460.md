###### § 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Methods for performing as found measurements from individual centrifugal compressor sources.

(2)If conducting measurements for each compressor source, you must determine the volumetric emissions from blowdown valves and isolation valves as specified in paragraph (o)(2)(i) of this section, and the volumetric emissions from wet seal oil degassing vents as specified in paragraph (o)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) For blowdown valves on compressors in operating-mode and for isolation valves on compressors in not-operating-depressurized-mode, determine the volumetric emissions using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (o)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) Determine the volumetric flow at standard conditions from the blowdown vent using calibrated bagging or high volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 98.234(c) and § 98.234(d), respectively.

(B) Determine the volumetric flow at standard conditions from the blowdown vent using a temporary meter such as a vane anemometer according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).

(C) Use an acoustic leak detection device according to methods set forth in § 98.234(a)(5).

(D) You may choose to use any of the methods set forth in § 98.234(a) to screen for emissions. If emissions are detected using the methods set forth in § 98.234(a), then you must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (o)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. If emissions are not detected using the methods in § 98.234(a), then you may assume that the volumetric emissions are zero. For the purposes of this paragraph, when using any of the methods in § 98.234(a), emissions are detected whenever a leak is detected according to the methods.

(ii) For wet seal oil degassing vents in operating-mode, determine vapor volumes at standard conditions, using a temporary meter such as a vane anemometer or permanent flow meter according to methods set forth in § 98.234(b).
