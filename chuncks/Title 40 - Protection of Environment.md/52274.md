####### Fluorinated-GHG throughput limit.

(iv)You may use the alternative to the error calculation specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section only if the total annual CO-equivalent fluorinated GHG throughput of the process is 500,000 mtCOe or less. The total throughput is the sum of the masses of the fluorinated GHG reactants, products, and by-products fed into and generated by the process. To convert these masses to COe, use Equation A-1 of ยง 98.2. For fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, use a default GWP of 2,000.
