(i)(A) Letter of September 3, 1987, from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and attached transportation control measures adopted August 18, 1987.

(B) Revision of the Wichita-Sedgwick County Portion of the Kansas State Implementation Plan for Carbon Monoxide submitted by the Governor on March 1, 1985. The plan contains an attainment demonstration, emissions inventory, and a control strategy.

(23) Kansas Administrative Regulations (K.A.R.) 28-19-19(a) through 28-19-19(o) pertaining to continuous emission monitoring at certain stationary sources were submitted on January 6, 1988, by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. K.A.R. 28-19-19(o) allows for departmental discretion on use of different but equivalent procedures than those specified in 28-19-19(a) through 28-19-19(n). EPA approves this rule with the understanding that all such equivalent procedures and requirements must be submitted to EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable provisions of K.A.R. 28-19-19(a) through 28-19-19(n) shall be applicable.
