(ii) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of all thevalues (see 40 CFR 1065.602). Verify choked flow by plottingas a function of.will have a relatively constant value for choked flow; as vacuum pressure increases, the venturi will become unchoked andwill decrease. Paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) through (viii) of this section describe how to verify your range of choked flow.
