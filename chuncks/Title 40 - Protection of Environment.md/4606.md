####### Filter holder assembly.

7.3.5The sampler shall have a sample filter holder assembly to adapt and seal to the down tube and to hold and seal the specified filter, under section 6.0 of this appendix, in the sample air stream in a horizontal position below the downtube such that the sample air passes downward through the filter at a uniform face velocity. The upper portion of this assembly shall be fabricated as indicated in Figures L-25 and L-26 of this appendix and shall accept and seal with the filter cassette, which shall be fabricated as indicated in Figures L-27 through L-29 of this appendix.

(a) The lower portion of the filter holder assembly shall be of a design and construction that:

(1) Mates with the upper portion of the assembly to complete the filter holder assembly,

(2) Completes both the external air seal and the internal filter cassette seal such that all seals are reliable over repeated filter changings, and

(3) Facilitates repeated changing of the filter cassette by the sampler operator.

(b) Leak-test performance requirements for the filter holder assembly are included in section 7.4.6 of this appendix.

(c) If additional or multiple filters are stored in the sampler as part of an automatic sequential sample capability, all such filters, unless they are currently and directly installed in a sampling channel or sampling configuration (either active or inactive), shall be covered or (preferably) sealed in such a way as to:

(1) Preclude significant exposure of the filter to possible contamination or accumulation of dust, insects, or other material that may be present in the ambient air, sampler, or sampler ventilation air during storage periods either before or after sampling; and

(2) To minimize loss of volatile or semi-volatile PM sample components during storage of the filter following the sample period.
