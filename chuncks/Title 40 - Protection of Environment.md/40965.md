####### Performance test.

(ii)A performance test is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with § 65.83(b)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks. The owner or operator is not required to prepare a design evaluation for the halogen reduction device as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section if a performance test will be performed that meets the following criteria:

(A) The performance test demonstrates that the halogen reduction device achieves greater than or equal to the required control efficiency specified in § 65.83(b)(1) for transfer racks; and

(B) The performance test meets the applicable performance test requirements of §§ 65.157 and 65.158, and the results are submitted as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in § 65.165(b).

(iii) If the halogen reduction device used to comply with § 65.83(b)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks, is also used to comply with § 65.63(b)(1) for process vents, or § 65.83(b)(1) for high-throughput transfer racks, a performance test required by § 65.154(b) is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with § 65.83(b)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks. The owner or operator is not required to prepare a design evaluation for the halogen reduction device as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if a performance test will be performed which meets the following criteria:

(A) The performance test demonstrates that the halogen reduction device achieves greater than or equal to the required control efficiency specified in § 65.83(b)(1) for transfer racks; and
