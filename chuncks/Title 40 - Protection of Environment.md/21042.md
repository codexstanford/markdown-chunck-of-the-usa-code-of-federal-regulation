######## Gross useful output

means the gross useful work performed by the stationary combustion turbine system. For units using the mechanical energy directly or generating only electricity, the gross useful work performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output from the turbine/generator set. For combined heat and power units, the gross useful work performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output plus the useful thermal output (i.e., thermal energy delivered to a process).
