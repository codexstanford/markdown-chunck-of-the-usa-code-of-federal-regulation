###### Urban scale

(4)-Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the NOmonitoring network identified in paragraph 4.3.4 above.

4.3.6 NOMonitoring

(a) NO/NOmeasurements are included within the NCore multi-pollutant site requirements and the PAMS program. These NO/NOmeasurements will produce conservative estimates for NOthat can be used to ensure tracking continued compliance with the NONAAQS. NO/NOmonitors are used at these sites because it is important to collect data on total reactive nitrogen species for understanding Ophotochemistry.
