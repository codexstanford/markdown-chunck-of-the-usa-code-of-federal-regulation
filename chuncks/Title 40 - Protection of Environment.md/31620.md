###### § 63.1360 Applicability.
####### Applicability of this subpart.

(e)(1) Each provision set forth in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.

(i) The startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the owner or operator of an affected source to comply with one or more specific emission limitations to which a particular emission point is subject; and

(ii) The owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in §§ 63.1367(a)(3) and 63.1368(i).

(2) The provisions set forth in § 63.1363 shall apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the PAI process unit (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which § 63.1363 applies.

(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.
