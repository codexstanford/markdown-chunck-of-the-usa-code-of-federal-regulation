(9) Divide the mean CHconcentration by the reference concentration of CH, converted to a Cbasis. The result is the CHcombined response factor and penetration fraction,. Use this combined CHresponse factor and CHpenetration fraction and the product of the CHresponse factor and CHpenetration fraction,, set to 1.0 in emission calculations according to ยง 1065.660(b)(2)(i) or (d)(1)(i) or ยง 1065.665, as applicable.
