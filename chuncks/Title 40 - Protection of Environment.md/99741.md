(d) The test sequence consists of preconditioning the engine by running one or two FTPs with each FTP followed by (20 +/-1) minutes with no engine operation and a hot start run through the LLC. You may start any preconditioning FTP with a hot engine. Perform testing as described in 40 CFR 1065.530 for a test interval that includes engine starting. Calculate the total emission mass of each constituent,and the total work,as described in 40 CFR 1065.650. Calculate total work over the test interval for powertrain testing using system power,Determineusing ยง 1036.520(f). For powertrains with automatic transmissions, account for and include the work produced by the engine from the CITT load. For batch sampling, you may sample background periodically into the bag over the course of multiple test intervals.

(e) Calculate and evaluate cycle statistics as specified in 40 CFR 1065.514 for nonhybrid engines and 40 CFR 1037.550 for hybrid engines and hybrid powertrains. For gaseous-fueled engine testing with a single-point fuel injection system, you may apply all the statistical criteria in ยง 1036.540(d)(3) to validate the LLC.
