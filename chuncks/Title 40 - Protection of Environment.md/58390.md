####### Position of ingredient statement.

(2)(i) The ingredient statement is normally required on the front panel of the label. If there is an outside container or wrapper through which the ingredient statement cannot be clearly read, the ingredient statement must also appear on such outside container or wrapper. If the size or form of the package makes it impracticable to place the ingredient statement on the front panel of the label, permission may be granted for the ingredient statement to appear elsewhere.

(ii) The text of the ingredient statement must run parallel with other text on the panel on which it appears, and must be clearly distinguishable from and must not be placed in the body of other text.
