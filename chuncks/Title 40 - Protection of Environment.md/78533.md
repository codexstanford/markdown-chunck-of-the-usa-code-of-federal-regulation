####### Manufacture for commercial purposes

(h)means to import, produce, or manufacture with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer and includes, among other things, such "manufacture" of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture:

(1) For commercial distribution, including for test marketing.

(2) For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research and development, or as an intermediate. Manufacture for commercial purposes also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another substance or mixture, including byproducts and coproducts that are separated from that other substance or mixture, and impurities that remain in that substance or mixture. Byproducts and impurities may not in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of the manufacture of a chemical produced for a commercial purpose.
