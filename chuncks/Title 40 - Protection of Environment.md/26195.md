####### Performance test requirements.

(a)Performance tests shall be conducted using the test methods and procedures in this section. Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests. Performance test results shall be documented in complete test reports that contain the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this section. The test plan to be followed shall be made available to the Administrator prior to the testing, if requested.

(1) A brief process description;

(2) Sampling location description(s);

(3) A description of sampling and analytical procedures and any modifications to standard procedures;

(4) Test results;

(5) Quality assurance procedures and results;

(6) Records of operating conditions during the test, preparation of standards, and calibration procedures;

(7) Raw data sheets for field sampling and field and laboratory analyses;

(8) Documentation of calculations; and

(9) Any other information required by the test method.

(b)(1) If the owner or operator of an affected source conducts performance testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the affected source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with this subpart if:

(i) The test methods and procedures identified in paragraph (c) of this section were used during the performance test;

(ii) The performance test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;

(iii) The performance test report contains the elements required by paragraph (a) of this section;

(iv) The owner or operator of the affected source for which the performance test was conducted has sufficient data to establish the operating parameter value(s) that correspond to compliance with the standards, as required for continuous compliance monitoring under ยง 63.343(c);

(v) The performance test was conducted after January 25, 1995;

(vi) As of September 19, 2012 the source was using the same emissions controls that were used during the compliance test;

(vii) As of September 19, 2012, the source was operating under conditions that are representative of the conditions under which the source was operating during the compliance test; and

(viii) Based on approval from the permitting authority.
