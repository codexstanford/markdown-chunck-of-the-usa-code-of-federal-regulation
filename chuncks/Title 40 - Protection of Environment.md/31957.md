####### Large control devices.

(ii)For devices controlling greater than or equal to 10 tons/yr of HAP for which a performance test is required, the parameter level must be established as follows:

(A) If the operating parameter level to be established is a maximum or minimum, it must be based on the average of the average values from each of the three test runs.

(B) The owner or operator may establish the parametric monitoring level(s) based on the performance test supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values. The rationale for the specific level for each parameter, including any data and calculations used to develop the level(s) and a description of why the level indicates proper operation of the control device shall be provided in the Precompliance plan. Determination of the parametric monitoring level using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
