(a) For calendar year 2011 monitoring, the facility may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods as listed in ยง 98.3(d)(1)(i) through (iv). The request must be submitted no later than October 12, 2010 and must contain the information in ยง 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2011.

(b) You must determine the concentration of organic material in wastewater treated anaerobically using analytical methods for COD or BODspecified in 40 CFR 136.3 Table 1B. For the purpose of determining concentrations of wastewater influent to the anaerobic wastewater treatment process, samples may be diluted to the concentration range of the approved method, but the calculated concentration of the undiluted wastewater must be used for calculations and reporting required by this subpart.
