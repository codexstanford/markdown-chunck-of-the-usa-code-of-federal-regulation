###### ยง 86.447-2006 What provisions apply to motorcycle engines below 50 cc that are certified under the Small SI program or the Recreational-vehicle program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce into commerce a new highway motorcycle (that is, a motorcycle that is a motor vehicle) if it has an engine below 50 cc that is already certified to the requirements that apply to engines or vehicles under 40 CFR part 90 or 1051 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 90 or 1051 for each engine or vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 86 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 86. See ยง 86.448-2006 for similar provisions that apply to vehicles that are certified to chassis-based standards under 40 CFR part 1051.
