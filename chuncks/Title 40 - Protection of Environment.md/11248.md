####### Determination of attainment.

(q)Effective February 10, 2023, the EPA has determined that, based on 2019 to 2021 ambient air quality data, the Imperial County PMnonattainment area has attained the 2012 annual PMNAAQS. Under the provisions of the EPA's PMimplementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.1015), this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 2012 annual PMNAAQS. If the EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2012 annual PMNAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
