######## Determine the transfer efficiency for each coating.,see,see,see

(g)You must determine the transfer efficiency for each primer-surfacer and topcoat coating, and for all coatings, except for deadener and for adhesive and sealer that are not components of glass bonding systems, used in coating operations added to the affected source pursuant to § 63.3082(c) using ASTM Method D5066-91 (Reapproved 2017), "Standard Test Method for Determination of the Transfer Efficiency Under Production Conditions for Spray Application of Automotive Paints-Weight Basis" (incorporated by reference,§ 63.14), or the guidelines presented in "Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat" EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,§ 63.14). You may conduct transfer efficiency testing on representative coatings and for representative spray booths as described in "Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat" EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,§ 63.14). You may assume 100 percent transfer efficiency for electrodeposition primer coatings, glass bonding primers, and glass bonding adhesives. For final repair coatings, you may assume 40 percent transfer efficiency for air atomized spray and 55 percent transfer efficiency for electrostatic spray and high volume, low pressure spray. For blackout, chip resistant edge primer, interior color, inline repair, lower body anti-chip coatings, or underbody anti-chip coatings, you may assume 40 percent transfer efficiency for air atomized spray, 55 percent transfer efficiency for electrostatic spray and high volume-low pressure spray, and 80 percent transfer efficiency for airless spray.
