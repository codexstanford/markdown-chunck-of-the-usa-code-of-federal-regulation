####### For SI units,

(C)

(x) V= Volume of gas pumped by the positive displacement pump, in cubic feet (m) per revolution. This volume is dependent on the pressure differential across the positive displacement pump.

(xi) N = Number of revolutions of the positive displacement pump during the test phase while samples are being collected.

(xii) P= Barometric pressure, mm Hg (kPa).

(xiii) P= Pressure depression below atmospheric measured at the inlet to the positive displacement pump, in mm Hg (kPa) (during an idle mode).

(xiv) T= Average temperature of dilute exhaust entering positive displacement pump during test, &#xB0;R(&#xB0;K).

(8)(i) NMHC= HC- (rx CH).

(ii) Density= The density of non-methane hydrocarbon.
