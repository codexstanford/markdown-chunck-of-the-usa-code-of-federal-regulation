####### Recovery devices.

(5)The average VOC concentration in the vent upstream and downstream of the control device shall be determined using Method 25A or 25B of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter for recovery devices. The average VOC concentration shall correspond to the volume measurement by taking into account the sampling system response time.

(6) The VOC mass at the inlet and outlet of the combustion or recovery device during each testing interval shall be calculated as follows:

(7) The VOC mass emission rates at the inlet and outlet of the recovery or combustion device shall be calculated as follows:

(8) Where Method 25, 25A, or 25B is used to measure the percent reduction in VOC, the percent reduction across the combustion or recovery device shall be calculated as follows:

(9) Repeat the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section 3 times. The arithmetic average percent efficiency of the three runs shall determine the overall efficiency of the control device.

(10) Use of methods other than Method 25, 25A, or 25B shall be validated pursuant to Method 301 of appendix A to part 63 of this chapter.
