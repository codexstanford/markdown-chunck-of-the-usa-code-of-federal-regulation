###### Potential contamination.

3.3.2.4Determine the number of people served by drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to potential contamination. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations factors.

Assign distance-weighted population values from table 3-12 to this population as follows:

- Use the "Karst" portion of table 3-12 to assign values only for that portion of the population served by points of withdrawal that draw drinking water from a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site.

- Use the "Other Than Karst" portion of table 3-12 for the remainder of the population served by points of withdrawal subject to potential contamination.

Calculate the value for the potential contamination factor (PC) as follows:

If PC is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PC is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
