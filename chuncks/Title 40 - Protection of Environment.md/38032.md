######## Resin-bonded refractory product

means a formed refractory product that is manufactured using a phenolic resin or other type of thermosetting resin as a bonding agent. Resin-bonded refractory products are manufactured by mixing resin with alumina, magnesium oxide, graphite, silica, zirconia, or other refractory raw materials, and forming the mix into shapes. After forming, resin-bonded refractory products are cured in a curing oven and may be subsequently fired in a kiln.
