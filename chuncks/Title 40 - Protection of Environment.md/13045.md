(i)326 Indiana Administrative Code 13-3 Control of Gasoline Reid Vapor Pressure. Sections 1 through 7. Finally adopted by the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board January 11, 1995. Signed by the Secretary of State July 6, 1995. Effective August 5, 1995. Published at Indiana Register, Volume 18, Number 11, August 1, 1995.

(102) On June 6, 1995, and on September 28, 1995 the Indiana Department of Environmental Management submitted State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions establishing an enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) program in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. The new enhanced I/M program replaces the basic I/M programs in operation in Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd Counties. The Air Pollution Control Board adopted new rule 326 IAC 13-1.1 and repealed existing 326 IAC 13-1, thereby putting in place a revised I/M program.
