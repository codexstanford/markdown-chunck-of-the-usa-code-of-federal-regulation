For those stacks where the terrain rise within a distance range is greater than the effective stack height (, HE-TR is less than zero), the TAESH for that distance range is set equal to zero, and generic source number 1 should be used for that distance range forsubsequent distance ranges. Additionally, for all stacks with a physical stack height of less than or equal to 10 meters, use generic source number 1 for all distance ranges.For the remaining stacks, proceed to Step 10(D)(2).

2. For the remaining stacks, refer to Table 5.0-2 and, for each distance range, identify the generic source number that includes the TAESH. Use the values obtained from Steps 10(D)(1) and 10(D)(2) to complete the following summary worksheet;
