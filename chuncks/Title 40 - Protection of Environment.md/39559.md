######## Paints and allied products manufacturing

means the production of paints and allied products, the intended use of which is to leave a dried film of solid material on a substrate. Typically, the manufacturing processes that produce these materials are described by Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes 285 or 289 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 3255 and 3259 and are produced by physical means, such as blending and mixing, as opposed to chemical synthesis means, such as reactions and distillation. Paints and allied products manufacturing does not include:

(1) The manufacture of products that do not leave a dried film of solid material on the substrate, such as thinners, paint removers, brush cleaners, and mold release agents;

(2) The manufacture of electroplated and electroless metal films;

(3) The manufacture of raw materials, such as resins, pigments, and solvents used in the production of paints and coatings; and

(4) Activities by end users of paints or allied products to ready those materials for application.
