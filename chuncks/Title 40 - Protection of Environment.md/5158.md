####### Baseline actual emissions

(xxxv)means the rate of emissions, in tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(xxxv)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The reviewing authority shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation.
