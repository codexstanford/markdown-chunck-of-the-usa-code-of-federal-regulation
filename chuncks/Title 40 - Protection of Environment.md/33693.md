######## Monitoring method.

(iii)If you comply with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. If you comply with the total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate leak action level as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) You must determine the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each monitoring location using the "Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources" (incorporated by reference-see ยง 63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the Modified El Paso Method.

(B) You must convert the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in ppmv as methane) to a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) using the calculations in Section 7.0 of "Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources" (incorporated by reference-see ยง 63.14).
