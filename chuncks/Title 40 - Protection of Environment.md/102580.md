####### Pressure control.

(2)Maintain static pressure at the location where raw exhaust is introduced into the tunnel within +/-1.2 kPa of atmospheric pressure. You may use a booster blower to control this pressure. If you test using more careful pressure control and you show by engineering analysis or by test data that you require this level of control to demonstrate compliance at the applicable standards in this chapter, we will maintain the same level of static pressure control when we test.
