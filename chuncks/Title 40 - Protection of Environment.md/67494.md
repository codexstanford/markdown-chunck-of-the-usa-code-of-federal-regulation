####### Information required.

(2)The following information must be submitted with the certification of precompliance to support the determination that the limits established for the operating parameters identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are not likely to result in an exceedance of the allowable emission rates for particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl.

(i) General facility information:

(A) EPA facility ID number;

(B) Facility name, contact person, telephone number, and address;

(C) Description of boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste, including type and capacity of device;

(D) A scaled plot plan showing the entire facility and location of the boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste; and

(E) A description of the air pollution control system on each device burning hazardous waste, including the temperature of the flue gas at the inlet to the particulate matter control system.

(ii) Except for facilities complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits for metals or total chlorine and chloride provided by §§ 266.106 (b) or (e) and 266.107 (b)(1) or (e), respectively, the estimated uncontrolled (at the inlet to the air pollution control system) emissions of particulate matter, each metal controlled by § 266.106, and hydrogen chloride and chlorine, and the following information to support such determinations:

(A) The feed rate (lb/hr) of ash, chlorine, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, silver, and thallium in each feedstream (hazardous waste, other fuels, industrial furnace feedstocks);

(B) The estimated partitioning factor to the combustion gas for the materials identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and the basis for the estimate and an estimate of the partitioning to HCl and Clof total chloride and chlorine in feed materials. To estimate the partitioning factor, the owner or operator must use either best engineering judgment or the procedures specified in appendix IX of this part.

(C) For industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter (PM) back into the furnace and that will certify compliance with the metals emissions standards under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A), the estimated enrichment factor for each metal. To estimate the enrichment factor, the owner or operator must use either best engineering judgment or the procedures specified in "Alternative Methodology for Implementing Metals Controls" in appendix IX of this part.

(D) If best engineering judgment is used to estimate partitioning factors or enrichment factors under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) or (b)(2)(ii)(C) respectively, the basis for the judgment. When best engineering judgment is used to develop or evaluate data or information and make determinations under this section, the determinations must be made by a qualified, registered professional engineer and a certification of his/her determinations in accordance with § 270.11(d) of this chapter must be provided in the certification of precompliance.

(iii) For facilities complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits for metals or total chlorine and chloride provided by §§ 266.106 (b) or (e) and 266.107 (b)(1) or (e), the feed rate (lb/hr) of total chloride and chlorine, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, silver, and thallium in each feed stream (hazardous waste, other fuels, industrial furnace feedstocks).

(iv) For facilities complying with the Tier II or Tier III emission limits for metals or HCl and Cl(under §§ 266.106 (c) or (d) or 266.107(b)(2) or (c)), the estimated controlled (outlet of the air pollution control system) emissions rates of particulate matter, each metal controlled by § 266.106, and HCl and Cl, and the following information to support such determinations:

(A) The estimated air pollution control system (APCS) removal efficiency for particulate matter, HCl, Cl, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, silver, and thallium.

(B) To estimate APCS removal efficiency, the owner or operator must use either best engineering judgment or the procedures prescribed in appendix IX of this part.

(C) If best engineering judgment is used to estimate APCS removal efficiency, the basis for the judgment. Use of best engineering judgment must be in conformance with provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.

(v) Determination of allowable emissions rates for HCl, Cl, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, silver, and thallium, and the following information to support such determinations:

(A) For all facilities:
