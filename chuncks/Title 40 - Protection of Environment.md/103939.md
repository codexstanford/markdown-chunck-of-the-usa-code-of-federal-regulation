####### C,equivalent

-means a convention of expressing HC concentrations based on the total number of carbon atoms present, such that the C-equivalent of an HC concentration equals the concentration multiplied by the mean number of carbon atoms in each HC molecule. For example, the C-equivalent of 10 ppm of propane (CH) is 30 ppm. C-equivalent concentration values may be denoted as "ppmC" in the standard-setting part. Densities may also be expressed on a Cbasis. Note that calculating HC masses from concentrations and densities is only valid where they are each expressed on the same carbon basis.
