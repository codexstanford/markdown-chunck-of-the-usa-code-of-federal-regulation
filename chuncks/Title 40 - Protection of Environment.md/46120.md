####### SCR and lean NO,catalyst active/intrusive reductant delivery performance.

(B)The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration of the system to properly regulate reductant delivery (e.g., urea injection, separate injector fuel injection, post injection of fuel, air assisted injection/mixing) that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed any of the applicable emissions thresholds for NOaftertreatment systems as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). If no failure or deterioration of the reductant delivery system could result in an engine's emissions exceeding any of the applicable thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it is no longer able to deliver the desired quantity of reductant.
