(F)The manufacturer must perform a separate test for each monitoredcatalyst(s) (e.g., SCR catalyst). The catalyst(s) being evaluated must be deteriorated to the applicable malfunction criteria established by the manufacturer for the monitoring required by paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(A) and (g)(6)(ii)(B) of this section and using methods established by the manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (l)(7) of this section.

Emissions data are not required for the empty can demonstration.
