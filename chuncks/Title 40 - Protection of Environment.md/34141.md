####### ยง 63.3171 How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
######## Capture of electrodeposition bake oven emissions.

(f)You must show that the electrodeposition bake oven meets the criteria in sections 5.3 through 5.5 of Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 and directs all of the exhaust gases from the bake oven to an add-on control device. For purposes of this showing, an electrodeposition bake oven air seal is not considered a natural draft opening provided you demonstrate that the direction of air movement across the interface between the bake oven air seal and the bake oven is into the bake oven. You may use lightweight strips of fabric or paper, or smoke tubes to make such demonstrations. You cannot count air flowing from an electrodeposition bake oven air seal into an electrodeposition bake oven as air flowing through a natural draft opening unless you elect to treat that electrodeposition bake oven air seal as a natural draft opening.
