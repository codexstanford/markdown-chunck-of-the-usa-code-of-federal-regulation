######## Thermal exposure.

(1)We recommend that you select applications for a given engine family that represent the 90th percentile of exposure to thermal aging. For example, if a given engine family incorporates a periodic infrequent regeneration event that involves exposure to higher temperatures than are observed during normal (non-regeneration) operation, we recommend that you select an application wherein the total duration of the cumulative regeneration events is at the 90th percentile of expected applications for that family. For an engine that does not incorporate a distinct regeneration event, we recommend selecting an application that represents the 90th percentile in terms of the overall average temperature.
