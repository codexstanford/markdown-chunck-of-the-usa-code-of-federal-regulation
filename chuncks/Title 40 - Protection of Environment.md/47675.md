####### Changing content of manufacturer-specific scan tools.

(15)Manufacturers who opt to remove non-emissions related content from their manufacturer-specific scan tools and sell them to the persons specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall adjust the cost of the tool accordingly lower to reflect the decreased value of the scan tool. All emissions-related content that remains in the manufacturer-specific tool shall be identical to the information that is contained in the complete version of the manufacturer specific tool. Any manufacturer who wishes to implement this option must request approval from the Administrator prior to the introduction of the tool into commerce.
