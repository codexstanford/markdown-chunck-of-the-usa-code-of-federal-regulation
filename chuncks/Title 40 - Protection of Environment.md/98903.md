####### Study conduct,Observation of offspring.

(7)-(i)(A) All offspring must be examined cage-side at least daily for gross signs of mortality or morbidity.

(B) A total of 10 male offspring and 10 female offspring per dose group must be examined outside the cage for signs of toxicity on days 4, 11, 21, 35, 45, and 60. The offspring must be observed by trained technicians, who are unaware of the treatment being used, using standardized procedures to maximize interobserver reliability. Where possible, it is advisable that the same observer be used to evaluate the animals in a given study. If this is not possible, some demonstration of interobserver reliability is required. At a minimum, the end points outlined in paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section must be monitored as appropriate for the developmental stage being observed.

(C) Any gross signs of toxicity in the offspring must be recorded as they are observed, including the time of onset, degree, and duration.
