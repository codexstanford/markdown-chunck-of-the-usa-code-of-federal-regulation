###### Independent Measurement.

3.17Two independent measurements are spectra of two independent samples. Two independent samples are separated by, at least 5 cell volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell). There is no mixing of gas between two independent samples. Alternatively, estimate the analyte residence time empirically: (1) Fill cell to ambient pressure with a (known analyte concentration) gas standard, (2) measure the spectrum of the gas standard, (3) purge the cell with zero gas at the sampling rate and collect a spectrum every minute until the analyte standard is no longer detected spectroscopically. If the measured time corresponds to less than 5 cell volumes, use 5 * TC as the minimum interval between independent measurements. If the measured time is greater than 5 * TC, then use this time as the minimum interval between independent measurements.
