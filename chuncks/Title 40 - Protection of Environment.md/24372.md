(1) The owner or operator of a designated facility must achieve the increments of progress according to the schedule in table 3 of this subpart, except for those affected facilities specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Once this subpart becomes effective on January 7, 2000, any designated facility to which this subpart applies will remain subject to the schedule in table 3 if a subsequently approved State or Tribal plan contains a less stringent schedule, (a schedule that provides more time to comply with increments 1, 4 and/or 5 than does this Federal plan).

(2) The owner or operator of the specified designated facility in table 4 of this subpart must achieve the increments of progress according to the schedule in table 4 of this subpart.

(d) For designated facilities that are subject to the schedule requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner or operator (or the State or Tribal air pollution control authority) may submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office for approval alternative dates for achieving increments 2 and 3.
