####### e.g.,

(iii) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.

(A) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is still within the range of net heating values included in the original application, the owner or operator shall determine the net heating value on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application is still appropriate.

(B) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is lower than the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).
