###### ยง 98.83 Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process COemissions from each kiln using the procedure in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(a) For each cement kiln that meets the conditions specified in ยง 98.33(b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii), you must calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure COemissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) For each kiln that is not subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, calculate and report the process and combustion COemissions from the kiln by using the procedure in either paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

(c) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure COemissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(d) Calculate and report process and combustion COemissions separately using the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section.

(1) Calculate COprocess emissions from all kilns at the facility using Equation H-1 of this section:
