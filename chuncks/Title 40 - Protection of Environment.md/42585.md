####### Provisional approval of certification (or recertification) applications.

(3)Upon the successful completion of the required certification (or recertification) procedures of this section, each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system shall be deemed provisionally certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program for a period not to exceed 120 days following receipt by the Administrator of the complete certification (or recertification) application under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Notwithstanding this paragraph, no continuous emission or opacity monitor systems for a combustion source seeking to enter the Opt-in Program in accordance with part 74 of this chapter shall be deemed provisionally certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program. Data measured and recorded by a provisionally certified (or recertified) continuous emission or opacity monitoring system , operated in accordance with the requirements of appendix B to this part, will be considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional certification or recertification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the provisional certification (or recertification) by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120 days of receipt by the Administrator of the complete certification (or recertification) application. Note that when the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are used for the initial certification (or recertification) of a continuous emissions monitoring system, the date and time of provisional certification (or recertification) of the CEMS may be earlier than the date and time of completion of the required certification (or recertification) tests.
