####### ยง 60.2675 What operating limits must I meet and by when?
######## e.g.,

(1) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record all hourly average output values (milliamps, or the digital signal equivalent) from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (three 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 1-hour test runs):

(i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output, or the digital signal equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or digital bits;

(ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and
