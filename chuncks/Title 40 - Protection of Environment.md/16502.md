###### General.

Use Schedule D.3 to report forecast revenue and cost information summed in Schedules D.1 and D.2 for the years 1984 through 1990. Applicants applying for a permanent waiver must complete Schedule D.3 twice. Forecast revenues and costs in Schedule D.3 shall be compatible with productive capacity and pollution control assumptions underlying the operating revenue and cost forecasts incorporated into each set of Schedules D.1 and D.2. Applicants applying for a temporary waiver should use only the first assumption: installation of interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional SO2 controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO. The transfer of line items from Schedules D.1 and D.2 to this Schedule is explained in the following instructions.
