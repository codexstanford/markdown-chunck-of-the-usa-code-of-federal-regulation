###### Field-Measured BSAFs.

C.The following procedural and quality assurance requirements shall be met for field-measured BSAFs:

1. The field studies used shall be limited to those conducted in the Great Lakes System with fish at or near the top of the aquatic food chain (i.e., in trophic levels 3 and/or 4).

2. Samples of surface sediments (0-1 cm is ideal) shall be from locations in which there is net deposition of fine sediment and is representative of average surface sediment in the vicinity of the organism.

3. The Ks used shall be acceptable quality as described in section III.F below.

4. The site of the field study should not be so unique that the resulting BAF cannot be extrapolated to other locations where the criteria and values will apply.

5. The tropic level of the fish species shall be determined.

6. The percent lipid shall be either measured or reliably estimated for the tissue used in the determination of the BAF.
