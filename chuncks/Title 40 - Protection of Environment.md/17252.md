As specified in this section, we may require you to post a bond if you import into the United States containers that are subject to the standards of this subpart. See paragraph (f) of this section for the requirements related to importing containers that have been certified by someone else.

(a) Prior to importing containers into the U.S., we may require you to post a bond to cover any potential compliance or enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act if you cannot demonstrate to us that you have assets of an appropriate liquidity readily available in the United States with a value equal to the retail value of the containers that you will import during the calendar year.

(b) We may set the value of the bond up to five dollars per container.
