##### ยง 228.15 Dumping sites designated on a final basis.
###### Site management actions.

(x)Once disposal operations at the site begin, the three-tier monitoring program described in paragraphs (l)(3)(ix) (A) through (C) of this section shall be implemented on an annual basis, through December 31, 1998, independent of the actual volumes disposed at the site. Thereafter, the Regional Administrator may establish a minimum annual disposal volume (not to exceed 10 percent of the designated site capacity at any time) below which this monitoring program need not be fully implemented. The Regional Administrator shall promptly review monitoring reports for the SF-DODS along with any other information available to the Regional Administrator concerning site monitoring activities. If the information gathered from monitoring at a given monitoring tier is not sufficient for the Regional Administrator to base reasonable conclusions as to whether disposal at the SF-DODS might be endangering the marine ecosystem, then the Regional Administrator shall require intensified monitoring at a higher tier. If monitoring at a given tier establishes that disposal at the SF-DODS is endangering the marine ecosystem, then the Regional Administrator shall require modification, suspension or termination of site use.
