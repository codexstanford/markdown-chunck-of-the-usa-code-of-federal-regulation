####### 2,For English units,

()P= P- PPI(SP.GR./13.57).

(F) P= barometric pressure, kPa (in. Hg.).

(G) PPI = Pump inlet depression, kPa (in. fluid).

(H) SP.GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid relative to water.

(iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated from the calibration data:

(A) X= correlation function.

(B) Δ P= The pressure differential from pump inlet to pump outlet, kPa (in. Hg) = P- P.
