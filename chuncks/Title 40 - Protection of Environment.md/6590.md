1.2This pre-survey method is intended for use at corn wet-milling (CWM) facilities to satisfy the requirements of Method 18, Section 16 (Pre-survey). This procedure establishes the analytes for subsequent Method 18 testing to determine the total mass emissions of VOCs from sources at CWM facilities. The specific objectives of the pre-survey procedure are:

1.2.1 Identify the physical characteristics of the VOC contained in the effluent.

1.2.2 Determine the appropriate Method 18 sampling approach to ensure efficient collection of all VOC present in the effluent.

1.2.3 Develop a specific list of target compounds to be quantified during the subsequent total VOC test program.

1.2.4 Qualify the list of target compounds as being a true representation of the total VOC.
