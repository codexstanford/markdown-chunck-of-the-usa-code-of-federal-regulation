###### Combined effluents.

3.6When the effluents from two or more affected facilities of similar design and operating characteristics are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the State plan may allow monitoring systems to be installed on the combined effluent. When the affected facilities are not of similar design and operating characteristics, or when the effluent from one affected facility is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the State should establish alternate procedures to implement the intent of these requirements.
