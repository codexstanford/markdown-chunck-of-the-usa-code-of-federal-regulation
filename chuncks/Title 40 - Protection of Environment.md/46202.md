####### Evaporative system MIL activation and DTC storage.

(iv)(A) Except as provided for in paragraph (h)(7)(iv)(B) of this section, the MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(B) If the OBD system is capable of discerning that a system leak is being caused by a missing or improperly secured gas cap, the OBD system need not activate the MIL or store a DTC provided the vehicle is equipped with an alternative indicator for notifying the operator of the gas cap problem. The alternative indicator must be of sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions. If the vehicle is not equipped with such an alternative indicator, the MIL must activate and a DTC be stored as required in paragraph (h)(7)(iv)(A) of this section; however, these may be deactivated and erased, respectively, if the OBD system determines that the gas cap problem has been corrected and the MIL has not been activated for any other malfunction. The Administrator may approve other strategies that provide equivalent assurance that a vehicle operator will be notified promptly of a missing or improperly secured gas cap and that corrective action will be undertaken.
