###### ยง 59.506 How do I demonstrate compliance if I manufacture multi-component kits?

(a) If you manufacture multi-component kits as defined in ยง 59.503, then the Kit PWR must not exceed the Total Reactivity Limit.

(b) You must calculate the Kit PWR and the Total Reactivity Limit as follows:

(1) KIT PWR = (PWRx W) + (PWRx W) + . ... + (PWRx W)

(2) Total Reactivity Limit = (RLx W) + (RLx W) + ... + (RLx W).

(3) Kit PWR &#x2264;Total Reactivity Limit.
