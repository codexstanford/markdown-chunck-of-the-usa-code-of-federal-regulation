####### Compliance schedule.

(a)Except as allowed in ยง 65.102(b) or as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors in each process unit initially for leaks by either 12 months after the implementation date as specified in ยง 65.1(f) or 12 months after initial startup, whichever is later. If all connectors in each process unit have been monitored for leaks prior to the implementation date specified in ยง 65.1(f), no initial monitoring is required provided either no process changes have been made since the monitoring or the owner or operator can determine that the results of the monitoring, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. If required to monitor because of a process change, the owner or operator is required to monitor only those connectors involved in the process change.
