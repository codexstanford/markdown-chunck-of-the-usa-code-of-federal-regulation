####### Compliance determination for SO

(iv). Compliance with the SOemission limit described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section shall be determined based on a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day basis. The rolling 30-boiler-operating-day SOemission rate for the unit shall be calculated for each boiler operating day in accordance with the following procedure: Step one, sum the hourly pounds of SOemitted for the current boiler operating day and the preceding twenty-nine (29) boiler operating days to calculate the total pounds of SOemitted over the most recent thirty (30) boiler-operating-day period for that unit; Step two, sum the total heat input, in MMBtu, during the current boiler operating day and the preceding twenty-nine (29) boiler operating days to calculate the total heat input over the most recent thirty (30) boiler-operating-day period for that unit; Step three, divide the total amount of SOcalculated from Step one by the total heat input calculated from Step two to calculate the rolling 30-boiler-operating-day SOemission rate, in pounds per MMBtu for that unit. Each rolling 30-boiler-operating-day SOemission rate shall include all emissions and all heat input that occur during all periods within any boiler operating day, including emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction. If a valid SOpounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for the unit, that heat input and SOpounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the rolling 30-boiler-operating-day emission rate.
