###### Calculation of environmental threat-waste characteristics factor category value.

4.2.4.2.3For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.2.4.2.1.5, use its ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply the ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10. Then multiply this product by the ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 10. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the environmental threat-waste characteristics category for the watershed. Enter the value in table 4-25.
