(3) Calculate the incremental COemissions due to air conditioning operation by subtracting the composite mass-weighted emissions of COwith the vehicle's air conditioner and the solar heating on,from the composite mass-weighted emissions of COwith the vehicle's air conditioner and the solar heating off,

(h) Record information for each test as specified in ยง 1066.695. Emission results and the results of all calculations must be reported for each phase of the test. The manufacturer must also report the following information for each vehicle tested: interior volume, climate control system type and characteristics, refrigerant used, compressor type, and evaporator/condenser characteristics.
