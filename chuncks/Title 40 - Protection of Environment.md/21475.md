###### ยง 60.5430 What definitions apply to this subpart?
####### Natural gas transmission and storage segment

means the transport or storage of natural gas prior to delivery to a "local distribution company custody transfer station" (as defined in this section) or to a final end user (if there is no local distribution company custody transfer station). For the purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage segment after the natural gas processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage segment after the point of "custody transfer" (as defined in this section). A compressor station that transports natural gas prior to the point of "custody transfer" or to a natural gas processing plant (if present) is not considered a part of the natural gas transmission and storage segment.
