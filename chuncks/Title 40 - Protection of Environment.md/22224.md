###### 13.2 System Bias.

This specification is applicable to both the system bias and 2-point system calibration error tests described in section 8.2.5 and 8.5. The pre- and post-run system bias (or system calibration error) must be within +/-5.0 percent of the calibration span for the low-level and upscale calibration gases. Alternatively, the results are acceptable if | C-C| is &#x2264;0.5 ppmv or if | C- C| is &#x2264;0.5 ppmv (as applicable).
