######## Incinerator

means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds, with or without heat recovery. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. An incinerator may use a catalytic combustion process where a substance is introduced into an exhaust stream to burn or oxidize contaminants while the substances itself remains intact, or a thermal process which uses elevated temperatures as a primary means to burn or oxidize contaminants.
