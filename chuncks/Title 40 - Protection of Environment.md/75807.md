##### Subpart A - Organic Pesticide Chemicals Manufacturing Subcategory
###### ยง 455.20 Applicability; description of the organic pesticide chemicals manufacturing subcategory.

(a) For the purpose of calculating and applying effluent limitations for COD, BOD, and TSS, and applying pH limits under BPT (ยง 455.22), BCT (ยง 455.23), and NSPS (ยง 455.25), the provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of organic pesticide active ingredients and organo-tin pesticide active ingredients, excluding the following: Allethrin; Benzyl Benzoate; Bisethylxanthogen; Chlorophacinone; Coumafuryl; Dimethyl Phthalate; Diphacinone; Endothall Acid; EXD (Herbisan); Gibberellic Acid; Glyphosate; Naphthalene Acetic Acid; Propargite; 1,8 Naphthalic Anhydride; Quinmethionate; Rotenone; Sulfoxide; Triazine compounds (both symmetrical and asymmetrical); and Warfarin and similar anticoagulants. Provided, however, that the effluent limitations of this subpart for BODand TSS, but not COD, apply to manufacturers of Ametryn, Prometon, Prometryn, Terbutryn, Cyanazine, Atrazine, Propazine, Simazine, Terbuthylazine, Hexazinone, and Glyphosate.

(b) For the purpose of calculating BPT effluent limitations for organic Pesticide chemicals, the provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of the following organic active ingredients: Aldrin, BHC, Captan, Chlordane, DDD, DDE, DDT, Dichloran, Dieldrin, Endosulfan, Endrin, Heptachlor, Lindane, Methoxychlor, Mirex, PCNB, Toxaphene, Trifluralin, Azinphos Methyl, Demeton-O, Demeton-S, Diazinon, Disulfoton, Malathion, Parathion Methyl, Parathion Ethyl, Aminocarb, Carbaryl, Methiocarb, Mexacarbate, Propoxur, Barban, Chlorpropham, Diuron, Fenuron, Fenuron-TCA, Linuron, Monuron, Monuron-TCA, Neubron, Propham, Swep, 2,4-D, Dicamba, Silvex, 2,4,5-T, Siduron, Perthane, and Dicofol.

(c) The intermediates used to manufacture the active ingredients and active ingredients used solely in experimental pesticides are excluded from coverage in this subpart. Insecticidal pathogenic organisms such as Bacillus thuringiensis, insect growth hormones, plant extracts such as pyrethrins; sex attractants and botanicals such as Rotenone are also excluded from BPT coverage in this subpart.

(d) A plant that manufactures a pesticide active ingredient listed in Table 1 of this part must comply with the BAT effluent limitations and new source performance and pretreatment standards for that pesticide active ingredient listed in table 2 (BAT and PSES) or Table 3 of this part (NSPS and PSNS). A plant that manufactures a pesticide active ingredient listed in Table 1 of this part must also comply with the BAT effluent limitations and new source performance and pretreatment standards for priority pollutants listed in Tables 4, 5 and 6 of this part. The limitations in Table 4 of this part (BAT and NSPS) are applicable to existing and new direct discharge point sources that use End-of-Pipe biological treatment. The limitations in Table 5 of this part (BAT and NSPS) are applicable to existing and new direct discharge point sources that do not use end-of-pipe biological treatment. The limitations in Table 6 of this part (PSES and PSNS) are applicable to existing and new sources that discharge to Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
