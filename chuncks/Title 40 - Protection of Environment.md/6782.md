(i) In any marginal nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.1:1;

(iii) In any serious nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.2:1;

(iv) In any severe nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.3:1 (except that the ratio may be at least 1.2:1 if the State also requires all existing major sources in such nonattainment area to use BACT for the control of VOC); and

(v) In any extreme nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.5:1 (except that the ratio may be at least 1.2:1 if the State also requires all existing major sources in such nonattainment area to use BACT for the control of VOC); and

Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph IV.G.2 of this Ruling for meeting the requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling, the ratio of total actual emissions reductions of VOC to the emissions increase of VOC shall be at least 1.15:1 for all areas within an ozone transport region that is subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, except for serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act.

4. In meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling for ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart 1, part D, title I of the Act (but are not subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, including 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas subject to 40 CFR 51.902(b)), the ratio of total actual emissions reductions of VOC to the emissions increase of VOC shall be at least 1:1.
