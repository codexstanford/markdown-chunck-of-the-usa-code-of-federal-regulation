####### Scope.

(a)(1) Nothing in this part precludes a state from adopting or enforcing requirements that are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part or from operating a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions with more stringent requirements or a broader scope of coverage than that required under this part.

(2) All states which develop and implement a Subtitle D permit program must submit an application for an adequacy determination for purposes of this part. Except as provided in ยง 239.12, state Subtitle D permit programs which received full approval prior to November 23, 1998 need not submit new applications for approval under this part. Similarly, except as provided in ยง 239.12, states that received partial approval of their Subtitle D permit programs prior to November 23, 1998 need not reapply under this part for approval for those program elements EPA has already determined to be adequate.

(3) If EPA determines that a state Subtitle D permit program is inadequate, EPA will have the authority to enforce the Subtitle D federal revised criteria on the RCRA section 4010(c) regulated facilities under the state's jurisdiction.
