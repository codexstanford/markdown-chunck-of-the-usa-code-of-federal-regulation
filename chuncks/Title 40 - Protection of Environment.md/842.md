###### Claims for loss or damage to household items.

(d)(1) Claims for damages to household goods may be allowed where:

(i) The loss or damages occurred while the goods were being shipped pursuant to an EPA authorized change in duty station;

(ii) The employee filed a claim for the damages with the appropriate carrier; and

(iii) The employee substantiates that he/she has suffered a loss in excess of the amount paid by the carrier.

(2) Where a carrier has refused to make an award to an employee because of his/her failure to comply with the carrier's claims procedures, any award by EPA will be reduced by the maximum amount payable for the item by the carrier under its contract of shipment. Where an employee fails to notify the carrier of damages or loss, either at the time of delivery of the household goods or within a reasonable time after discovery, any award by EPA will be reduced by the amount of the carrier's maximum contractual liability for the damage or loss. The employee has the burden of proving his/her entitlement to reimbursement from EPA for amounts in excess of that allowed by the carrier.
