###### ยง 795.70 Indirect photolysis screening test: Sunlight photolysis in waters containing dissolved humic substances.
####### Phase 3-Indirect photoreaction with actinometer: Calculation of,and,Introduction and purpose.

(d)kk-(1)

(i) The purpose of Phase 3 is to measure k, the indirect photolysis rate constant in tubes, and then to calculate kfor the test chemical in a natural water. If the approximate (k)determined in Phase 2 is not significantly greater than kmeasured for the experiment date of Phase 2, then Phase 3 is unnecessary because the test chemical is not subject to indirect photoreaction.

(ii) In the case (k)is significantly larger than k, Phase 3 is necessary. The rate constant (k)is used to choose an actinometer composition that matches the actinometer rate to the test chemical rate. Test chemical solutions in SHW and in pure water buffer are then irradiated in sunlight in parallel with actinometer solutions, all in tubes.
