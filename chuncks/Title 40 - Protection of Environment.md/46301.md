(7)-(i)For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction limits for the monitoring required by paragraphs (g)(5)(ii)(A), (g)(5)(ii)(B), and (g)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, where those catalysts are monitored individually, the manufacturer must use a catalyst deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using methods established by the manufacturer to represent real world catalyst deterioration under normal and malfunctioning engine operating conditions. For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction limits for the monitoring required by paragraphs (g)(5)(ii)(A), (g)(5)(ii)(B), and (g)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, where those catalysts are monitored in combination with other catalysts, the manufacturer must submit their catalyst system aging and monitoring plan to the Administrator as part of their certification documentation package. The plan must include the description, emission control purpose, and location of each component, the monitoring strategy for each component and/or combination of components, and the method for determining the applicable malfunction criteria including the deterioration/aging process.
