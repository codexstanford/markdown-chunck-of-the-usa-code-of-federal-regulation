####### ยง 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## Bromine and sulfur considerations.

(ii)If you operate an incinerator, boiler, or lightweight aggregate kiln and your feedstreams contain bromine or sulfur during the comprehensive performance test at levels specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, you must use EPA Method 320/321 or ASTM D 6735-01, or an equivalent method, to measure hydrogen chloride, and Method 26/26A, or an equivalent method, to measure chlorine and hydrogen chloride, and determine your chlorine emissions as follows:

(A) You must determine your chlorine emissions to be the higher of the value measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 of this chapter, or an equivalent method, or the value calculated by the difference between the combined hydrogen chloride and chlorine levels measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 of this chapter, or an equivalent method, and the hydrogen chloride measurement from EPA Method 320/321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01 as described under ยง 63.1208(b)(5)(i)(C), or an equivalent method.

(B) The procedures under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for determining hydrogen chloride and chlorine emissions apply if you feed bromine or sulfur during the performance test at the levels specified in this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B):
