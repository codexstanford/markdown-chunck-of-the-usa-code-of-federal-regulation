(a) Part D-Conditional Approval-The Illinois plan is approved provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) [Reserved]

(2) The State conducts a study to demonstrate that the 75 percent overall control efficiency requirement in Rule 205(n) represents RACT, submits the results of the study to USEPA, and submits any necessary regulations representing RACT to the Illinois Pollution Control Board. The State must comply with these conditions by February 28, 1981. Any necessary regulations must be finally promulgated by the State and submitted to USEPA by February 28, 1982.

(3) Extension of Condition-USEPA approves the date of July 31, 1984 for the State of Illinois to satisfy the condition of approval to the ozone State Implementation Plan listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(b) Disapproval-USEPA disapproves the compliance schedule in Rule 205(j) as it applies to loading rack controls for all emission sources subject to Rule 205(b)(1), as approved by USEPA on May 31, 1972 which were required to be in compliance by December 31, 1973. This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).
