####### Exceptions.

(b)(1) If personal protective equipment were required for a product before the effective date of this subpart, the existing requirements shall be retained on the labeling wherever they are more specific or more protective (as specified in EPA guidance materials) than the requirements in the table in paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) Any existing labeling statement that prohibits the use of gloves or boots overrides the corresponding requirement in paragraph (e) of this section and must be retained on the labeling.

(3) If the product labeling contains uses that are not covered by part 170 of this chapter, the registrant may adopt the personal protective equipment required in this section for those uses. However, if the personal protective equipment required in this section would not be sufficiently protective or would be onerously overprotective for uses not covered by part 170 of this chapter, the registrant must continue to apply the existing personal protective equipment requirements to those uses. The labeling must indicate which personal protective equipment requirements apply to uses covered by part 170 of this chapter and which personal protective equipment requirements apply to other uses.
