###### emission offsets

This appendix sets forth EPA's Interpretative Ruling on the preconstruction review requirements for stationary sources of air pollution (not including indirect sources) under 40 CFR part 51, subpart I. A major new source or major modification which would locate in any area designated under section 107(d) of the Act as attainment or unclassifiable for ozone that is located in an ozone transport region or which would locate in an area designated in 40 CFR part 81, subpart C, as nonattainment for a pollutant for which the source or modification would be major may be allowed to construct only if the stringent conditions set forth below are met. These conditions are designed to ensure that the new source's emissions will be controlled to the greatest degree possible; that more than equivalent offsetting emission reductions () will be obtained from existing sources; and that there will be progress toward achievement of the NAAQS.

For each area designated as exceeding a NAAQS (nonattainment area) under 40 CFR part 81, subpart C, or for any area designated under section 107(d) of the Act as attainment or unclassifiable for ozone that is located in an ozone transport region, this Interpretative Ruling will be superseded after June 30, 1979 (a) by preconstruction review provisions of the revised SIP, if the SIP meets the requirements of part D, Title 1, of the Act; or (b) by a prohibition on construction under the applicable SIP and section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Act, if the SIP does not meet the requirements of part D. The Ruling will remain in effect to the extent not superseded under the Act. This prohibition on major new source construction does not apply to a source whose permit to construct was applied for during a period when the SIP was in compliance with part D, or before the deadline for having a revised SIP in effect that satisfies part D.

The requirement of this Ruling shall not apply to any major stationary source or major modification that was not subject to the Ruling as in effect on January 16, 1979, if the owner or operator:

A. Obtained all final Federal, State, and local preconstruction approvals or permits necessary under the applicable State Implementation Plan before August 7, 1980;

B. Commenced construction within 18 months from August 7, 1980, or any earlier time required under the applicable State Implementation Plan; and

C. Did not discontinue construction for a period of 18 months or more and completed construction within a reasonable time.
