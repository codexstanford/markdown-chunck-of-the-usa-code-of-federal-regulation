###### § 761.274 Reporting PCB concentrations in samples.

(a) Report all sample concentrations for non-liquid PCBs on a dry weight basis as micrograms of PCBs per gram of sample (ppm by weight). Report surface sampling results as µg/100 cm. Divide 100 cmby the surface area and multiply this quotient by the total number of micrograms of PCBs on the surface to obtain the equivalent measurement of micrograms per 100 cm.

(b) Report all sample concentrations for liquid PCBs on a wet weight basis as micrograms of PCBs per gram of sample (ppm by weight).
