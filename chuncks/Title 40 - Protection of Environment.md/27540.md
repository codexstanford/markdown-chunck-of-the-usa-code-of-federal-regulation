####### Maximum HAP vapor pressure

means the sum of the individual HAP equilibrium partial pressure exerted by an off-site material at the temperature equal to either: the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service when the off-site material is stored or treated at ambient temperature; or the highest calendar-month average temperature of the off-site material when the off-site material is stored at temperatures above the ambient temperature or when the off-site material is stored or treated at temperatures below the ambient temperature. For the purpose of this subpart, maximum HAP vapor pressure is determined using the procedures specified in ยง 63.694(j) of this subpart.
