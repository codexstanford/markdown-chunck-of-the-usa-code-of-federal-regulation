###### Relative Accuracy (RA)

3.3means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant (Hg) concentrations determined by the sorbent trap monitoring system and the values determined by the reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for low concentration sources, the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean sorbent trap monitoring system and RM values.
