####### Calculations of average concentration.

(iv)The average concentration for each individually speciated Table 8 compound shall be calculated by adding the individual values determined for the specific compound in each sample and dividing by the number of samples. The total average concentration of Table 9 compounds shall be calculated by first summing the concentration of the individual compounds to obtain a total hazardous air pollutants concentration for the sample; add the sample totals and then divide by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run. If the method used does not speciate the compounds, the sample results should be added and this total divided by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run.
