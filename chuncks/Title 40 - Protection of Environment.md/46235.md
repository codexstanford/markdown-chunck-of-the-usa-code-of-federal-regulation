####### Other emission control system monitoring,General.

(4)-(i)For other emission control systems that are either not addressed in paragraphs (g) through (i)(3) of this section (e.g., hydrocarbon traps, homogeneous charge compression ignition control systems), or addressed in paragraph (i)(3) of this section but not corrected or compensated for by an adaptive control system (e.g., swirl control valves), the manufacturer must submit a plan for Administrator approval of the monitoring strategy, malfunction criteria, and monitoring conditions prior to introduction on a production engine. The plan must demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring strategy, the malfunction criteria used, the monitoring conditions required by the monitor, and, if applicable, the determination that the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section are satisfied.

(ii) For engines that use emission control systems that alter intake air flow or cylinder charge characteristics by actuating valve(s), flap(s), etc., in the intake air delivery system (e.g., swirl control valve systems), the manufacturer, in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section, may elect to have the OBD system monitor the shaft to which all valves in one intake bank are physically attached rather than performing a functional check of the intake air flow, cylinder charge, or individual valve(s)/flap(s). For non-metal shafts or segmented shafts, the monitor must verify all shaft segments for proper functional response (e.g., by verifying that the segment or portion of the shaft farthest from the actuator functions properly). For systems that have more than one shaft to operate valves in multiple intake banks, the manufacturer is not required to add more than one set of detection hardware (e.g., sensor, switch) per intake bank to meet this requirement.
