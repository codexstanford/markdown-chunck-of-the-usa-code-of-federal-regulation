####### ยง 63.2853 How do I determine the actual solvent loss?
######## Measuring the beginning and ending solvent inventory.

(3)You are required to measure and record the solvent inventory on the beginning and ending dates of each normal operating period that occurs during an operating month. You must consistently follow the procedures described in your plan for demonstrating compliance, as specified in ยง 63.2851, to determine the extraction solvent inventory, and maintain readily available records of the actual solvent loss inventory, as described in ยง 63.2862(c)(1). In general, you must measure and record the solvent inventory only when the source is actively processing any type of agricultural product. When the source is not active, some or all of the solvent working capacity is transferred to solvent storage tanks which can artificially inflate the solvent inventory.
