####### Additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.

(1)Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, use an additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive deterioration factor for a pollutant is the difference between exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission results for each tested locomotive at the selected test point by adding the factor to the measured emissions. The deteriorated emission level is intended to represent the highest emission level during the useful life. Thus, if the factor is less than zero, use zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one more decimal place than the applicable standard.
