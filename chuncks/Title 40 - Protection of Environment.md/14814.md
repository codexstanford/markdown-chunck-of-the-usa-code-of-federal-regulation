####### Determination of attaining data.

(a)EPA has determined, as of November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

(b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).
