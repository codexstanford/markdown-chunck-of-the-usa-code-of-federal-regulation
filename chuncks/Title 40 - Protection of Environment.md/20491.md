######## e.g.,

(iii) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values, or their digital equivalent, from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (average all your PM CPMS output values for the three corresponding Method 5 or Method 29 p.m. test runs).

(2) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS output values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or Method 29 performance test with the procedures in (i)(1) through (5) of this section:

(i) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:
