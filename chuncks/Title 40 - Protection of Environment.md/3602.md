######## What general provisions apply under this program?

(d)The following general provisions apply to you as an owner/operator of a source:

(1) If you propose to construct a new major source or a major modification at an existing major source in a nonattainment area in Indian country, you must obtain a major NSR permit under this program before beginning actual construction. If you commence construction after the effective date of this program without applying for and receiving a permit pursuant to this program, you will be subject to appropriate enforcement action.

(2) If you do not construct or operate your source or modification in accordance with the terms of your major NSR permit issued under this program, you will be subject to appropriate enforcement action.

(3) Issuance of a permit under this program does not relieve you of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of any EPA-approved implementation plan or FIP and any other requirements under applicable law.

(4) Nothing in this program prevents a Tribe from administering a nonattainment major NSR permit program with different requirements in an approved TIP as long as the TIP meets the requirements of part D of title I of the Act.
