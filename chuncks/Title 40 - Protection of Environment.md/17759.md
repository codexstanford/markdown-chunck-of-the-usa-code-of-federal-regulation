####### Dry flue gas desulfurization technology

means a SOcontrol system that is located between the steam generating unit and the exhaust vent or stack, and that removes sulfur oxides from the combustion gases of the steam generating unit by contacting the combustion gases with an alkaline reagent and water, whether introduced separately or as a premixed slurry or solution and forming a dry powder material. This definition includes devices where the dry powder material is subsequently converted to another form. Alkaline reagents used in dry flue gas desulfurization systems include, but are not limited to, lime and sodium compounds.
