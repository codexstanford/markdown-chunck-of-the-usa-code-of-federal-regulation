() if a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average catalyst bed inlet temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average catalyst bed inlet temperature established in accordance with ยง 63.827(d).

(ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency. The percent control efficiency of the oxidizer shall be demonstrated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section except that separate continuous measurements of the inlet volumetric gas flow rate and the outlet volumetric gas flow rate are required for an oxidizer.

(3) To demonstrate compliance without the use of a control device, each owner or operator shall compare the mass of organic HAP used to the mass of volatile matter used each month, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) of this section:

(i) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used in the affected source during the month.

(ii) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used during the month following the procedure in ยง 63.827(b)(1), and

(iii) Determine the volatile matter content, including water, of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used during the month following the procedure in ยง 63.827(c)(1).

(iv) The affected source is in compliance for the month if the mass of organic HAP used does not exceed eight percent of the mass of volatile matter used.
