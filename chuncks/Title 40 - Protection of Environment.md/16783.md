###### Collocated Quality Control Sampler Precision Estimate for PM,, PM,and Pb,d

4.2.1. Precision is estimated via duplicate measurements from collocated samplers. It is recommended that the precision be aggregated at the PQAO level quarterly, annually, and at the 3-year level. The data pair would only be considered valid if both concentrations are greater than or equal to the minimum values specified in section 4(c) of this appendix. For each collocated data pair, calculate the relative percent difference,using equation 6 of this appendix:
