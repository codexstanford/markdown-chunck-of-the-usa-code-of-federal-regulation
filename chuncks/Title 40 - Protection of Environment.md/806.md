###### ยง 13.30 Standards for suspension.
####### Financial condition of debtor.

(b)The Administrator may suspend collection action on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in real or personal property and is unable to make payment on the claim or effect a compromise but the debtor's future financial prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, provided that:

(1) The applicable statute of limitations will not expire during the period of the suspension, can be tolled or has started running anew;

(2) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the 10-year statute of limitations for administrative offsets; or

(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.
