###### ยง 1065.640 Flow meter calibration calculations.

This section describes the calculations for calibrating various flow meters. After you calibrate a flow meter using these calculations, use the calculations described in ยง 1065.642 to calculate flow during an emission test. Paragraph (a) of this section first describes how to convert reference flow meter outputs for use in the calibration equations, which are presented on a molar basis. The remaining paragraphs describe the calibration calculations that are specific to certain types of flow meters.
