(A) Title R307 of the Utah Administrative Code,Rule R307-107,Effective July 31, 2012; as published in the Utah State Bulletin on March 1, 2012, modified on July 1, 2012, and August 15, 2012. Note: The August 15, 2012 publication contains a typographical error in the title of Rule R307-107.

(75) On September 15, 2006, the Governor submitted revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP) permitting rules. The September 15, 2006 submittal contains new, amended and renumbered rules in Utah Administrative Code (UAC) Title R-307 that pertain to the issuance of Utah air quality permits. EPA is approving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-1 through 6; R307-401-8; R307-401-9 (except for paragraph (b) and the portions of paragraph (c) that reference paragraph (b)); R307-401-10 through 11; R307-401-13; R307-401-17 through 20; and R307-410-1 through 4. EPA is disapproving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-7; R307-401-9(b) and the portions of 9(c) that reference (9)(b); R307-401-12; and R307-410-5. EPA is limitedly approving and limitedly disapproving R307-410-6 from the September 15, 2006 submittal-this means EPA is approving this rule because it will strengthen the SIP but is simultaneously disapproving it because it does not fully comply with applicable requirements. EPA is not acting on the revisions to UAC R307-101-2 because the revisions have been superseded by later revisions to the rule, which EPA approved at ยง 52.2320(c)(67) (see 73 FR 51222). EPA is not acting on R307-401-14 through 16 because EPA previously acted on such provisions (notice of final rulemaking signed October 19, 2012).
