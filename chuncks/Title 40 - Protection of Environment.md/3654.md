####### ยง 49.4162 Delegation of authority of administration to the tribes.
######## How is the delegation of administration accomplished?

(c)(1) A Delegation of Authority Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, will specify the rule and provisions that the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation shall be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA, and shall be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Regional Administrator and the authorized representative of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for assisting us with administration of this FIP and shall act as the Regional Administrator as that term is used in these regulations. Any Delegation of Authority Agreement will clarify the circumstances in which the term "Regional Administrator"' found throughout this FIP is to remain the EPA Regional Administrator and when it is intended to refer to the "Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation," instead.

(2) A Delegation of Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.
