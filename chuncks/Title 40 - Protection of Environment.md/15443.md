5.2.2.2Determine the values given by zero and span gas SOconcentrations at 2-hour intervals until 15 sets of data are obtained. Alternatively, for nonextractive measurement systems, determine the values given by an electrically or mechanically produced zero condition, and by inserting a certified calibration gas concentration equivalent to not less than 20 percent of span, into the measurement system. Record these readings on the example sheet shown in Figure D-4. These 2-hour periods need not be consecutive but may not overlap. If the analyzer span is set at the expected maximum concentration for the tests performed under section 5.2.2, then the zero and span determinations to be made under this paragraph may be made concurrent with the tests under section 5.2.2.1. Zero and calibration corrections and adjustments are allowed only at 24-hour intervals (except as required under section 5.2.2) or at such shorter intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify. Automatic corrections made by the measurement system without operator intervention or initiation are allowable at any time. During the entire 168-hour test period, record the values given by zero and span gas SOconcentrations before and after adjustment at 24-hour intervals in the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
