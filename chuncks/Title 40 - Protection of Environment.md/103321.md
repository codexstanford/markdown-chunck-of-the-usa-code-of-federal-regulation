###### ยง 1065.845 Response factor determination.
####### RF

(10) Divide the mean measured concentration by the recorded span concentration of the alcohol/carbonyl calibration gas on a C-equivalent basis. The result is the FID analyzer's response factor for alcohol/carbonyl,on a C-equivalent basis.

(c) Alcohol/carbonyl calibration gases must remain within +/-2% of the labeled concentration. You must demonstrate the stability based on a quarterly measurement procedure with a precision of +/-2% percent or another method that we approve. Your measurement procedure may incorporate multiple measurements. If the true concentration of the gas changes deviates by more than +/-2%, but less than +/-10%, the gas may be relabeled with the new concentration.
