###### 1.4 Data Quality Assessment for Low Emitters. Is performance relief granted when testing low-emission units?

Yes. For low-emitting sources, there are alternative performance specifications for analyzer calibration error, system bias, drift, and response time. Also, the alternative dynamic spiking procedure in section 16 may provide performance relief for certain low-emitting units.

In this method, a sample of the effluent gas is continuously sampled and conveyed to the analyzer for measuring the concentration of NO. You may measure NO and NOseparately or simultaneously together but, for the purposes of this method, NOis the sum of NO and NO. You must meet the performance requirements of this method to validate your data.
