####### ยง 53.57 Test for filter temperature control during sampling and post-sampling periods.
######## Filter temperature measurement accuracy.

(1)(i) For each 4-hour test period, calculate the absolute value of the difference between the mean filter temperature indicated by the sampler (active filter) and the mean filter temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor installed within 1 cm downstream of the (active) filter as:

(ii) To successfully pass the indicated filter temperature accuracy test, the calculated difference between the measured means (T) must not exceed 2 &#xB0;C for each 4-hour test period.
