####### iii,2,ii

() The average nitrogen oxides emissions (kilograms per day) on a calendar year basis shall be calculated as the sum of all daily total nitrogen oxides emissions calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)()() of this section divided by the number of calendar days for which a daily total was calculated.

(2) A State plan may establish a program to allow owners or operators of municipal waste combustor plants to engage in trading of nitrogen oxides emission credits. A trading program must be approved by EPA before implementation.

(3) For approval, a State plan shall include emission limits for nitrogen oxides from fluidized bed combustors at least as protective as the emission limits listed in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) The emission limit for nitrogen oxides contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility that is a fluidized bed combustor is 180 parts per million by volume, corrected to 7 percent oxygen.

(ii) If a State plan allows nitrogen oxides emissions averaging as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(v) of this section, the emission limit for nitrogen oxides contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility that is a fluidized bed combustor is 165 parts per million by volume, corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
