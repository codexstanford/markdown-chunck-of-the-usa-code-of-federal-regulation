####### Low mileage locomotive

means a locomotive during the interval between the time that normal assembly operations and adjustments are completed and the time that either 10,000 miles of locomotive operation or 300 additional operating hours have been accumulated (including emission testing if performed). Note that we may deem locomotives with additional operation to be low mileage locomotives, consistent with good engineering judgment.
