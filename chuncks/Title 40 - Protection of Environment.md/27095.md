(2)Monitor and record the inlet liquid flowrate and the inlet gas flowrate to the absorber and record the calculated L/V ratio. The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate liquid and gas flow indicators. For sources monitoring the L/V ratio established during the performance test, a data acquisition system shall record the flowrates and calculated ratio every 15 minutes and shall compute and record an average ratio each cycle (same time period or cycle as the performance test) and a 3-cycle block average ratio every third cycle. For sources monitoring the manufacturer recommended L/V ratio, a data acquisition system shall record the flowrates and calculated ratio every 15 minutes and shall compute and record an average ratio each hour and a 3-hour average ratio every third hour. The liquid and gas flow indicators shall be installed immediately upstream of the respective inlet lines to the absorber.
