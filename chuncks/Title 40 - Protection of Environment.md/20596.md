######## Kiln

means an oven or furnace, including any associated preheater or precalciner devices, in-line raw mills, in-line coal mills or alkali bypasses used for processing a substance by burning, firing or drying. Kilns include cement kilns that produce clinker by heating limestone and other materials for subsequent production of Portland Cement. Because the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill and in-line coal mill are considered an integral part of the kiln, the kiln emissions limits also apply to the exhaust of the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill and in-line coal mill.
