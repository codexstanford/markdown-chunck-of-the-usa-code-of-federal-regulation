(1) Continuous or repeated immersion exposure of 90 to 98 percent sulfuric acid, or oleum;

(2) Continuous or repeated immersion exposure to strong organic solvents;

(3) Continuous or repeated immersion exposure to petroleum processing at high temperatures and pressures; and

(4) Continuous or repeated immersion exposure to food or pharmaceutical products which may or may not require high temperature sterilization.
