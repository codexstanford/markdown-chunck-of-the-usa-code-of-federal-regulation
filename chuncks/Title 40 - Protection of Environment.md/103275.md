(b) Estimate the maximum expected mole fraction of water during emission testing,Make this estimate where the humidified NO span gas was introduced in ยง 1065.370(e)(6). When estimating the maximum expected mole fraction of water, consider the maximum expected water content in intake air, fuel combustion products, and dilution air (if applicable). If you introduced the humidified NO span gas into the sample system upstream of a sample dryer during the verification test, you need not estimate the maximum expected mole fraction of water and you must setequal to
