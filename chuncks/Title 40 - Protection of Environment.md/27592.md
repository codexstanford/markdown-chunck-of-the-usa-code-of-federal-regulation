###### § 63.691 Standards: Equipment leaks.

(a) The provisions of this section apply to the control of air emissions from equipment leaks for which § 63.683(d) references the use of this section for such air emissions control.

(b) According to the date an affected source commenced construction or reconstruction and the date an affected source receives off-site material for the first time, as established in § 63.680(e)(i) through (iii), the owner or operator shall control the HAP emitted from equipment leaks in accordance with the applicable provisions specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1)(i) The owner or operator controls the HAP emitted from equipment leaks in accordance with §§ 61.241 through 61.247 in 40 CFR part 61, subpart V-National Emission Standards for Equipment Leaks, with the difference noted in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section for the purposes of this subpart; or

(ii) The owner or operator controls the HAP emitted from equipment leaks in accordance with §§ 63.161 through 63.182 in subpart H of this part-National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from Equipment Leaks, with the differences noted in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section for the purposes of this subpart.

(iii) On or after March 18, 2015, for the purpose of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 61.242-6(a)(2) or the requirements of § 63.167(a)(2), the open end is sealed when instrument monitoring of the open-ended valve or line conducted according to Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A indicates no readings of 500 ppm or greater.

(iv) On or after March 18, 2015, for the purpose of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 61.242-6(d) or the requirements of § 63.167(d), open-ended valves or lines in an emergency shutdown system which are designed to open automatically in the event of a process upset and that are exempt from the requirements in 40 CFR 61.242-6(a), (b), and (c) or § 63.167(a), (b), and (c) must comply with the requirements in § 63.693(c)(2).

(2) The owner or operator controls the HAP emitted from equipment leaks in accordance with §§ 63.161 through 63.183 in subpart H of this part-National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants for Equipment Leaks, with the differences noted in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section for the purposes of this subpart.

(i) For each valve in gas/vapor or in light liquid service, as defined in § 63.681, that is part of an affected source under this subpart, an instrument reading that defines a leak is 500 ppm or greater as detected by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

(ii) For each pump in light liquid service, as defined in § 63.681, that is part of an affected source under this subpart, an instrument reading that defines a leak is 1,000 ppm or greater as detected by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Repair is not required unless an instrument reading of 2,000 ppm or greater is detected.

(iii) On or after March 18, 2015, for the purpose of complying with the requirements of § 63.167(a)(2), the open end is sealed when instrument monitoring of the open-ended valve or line conducted according to Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A indicates no readings of 500 ppm or greater.

(iv) On or after March 18, 2015, for the purpose of complying with the requirements of § 63.167(d), open-ended valves or lines in an emergency shutdown system which are designed to open automatically in the event of a process upset and that are exempt from the requirements in § 63.167(a), (b), and (c) must comply with the requirements in § 63.693(c)(2).

(v) For the purposes of this subpart, the pressure relief device requirements of § 63.691(c) of this subpart rather than those of § 63.165 or of 40 CFR 61.242-4, as applicable, shall apply. The pressure relief device requirements of § 63.691(c)(3) and (4) apply in addition to the requirements of § 63.169 or of 40 CFR 61.242-8, as applicable, for pressure relief devices in liquid service.
