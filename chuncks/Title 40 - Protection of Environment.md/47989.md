####### Special provisions for durability data vehicles.

(b)(1) For DDV's, the mileage at all test points shall be within 250 miles of the scheduled mileage point as required under ยง 86.1823-08(c)(3). Manufacturers may exceed the 250 mile upper limit if there are logistical reasons for the deviation and the manufacturer determines that the deviation will not affect the representativeness of the durability demonstration.

(2) For DDV's aged using the standard or a customized/alternative whole-vehicle cycle, all emission-related hardware and software must be installed and operational during all mileage accumulation after the 5000-mile test point.

(3) DDV's may be reconfigured before the 5000-mile test point providing that the representativeness of the emission results will not be affected. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in making such determinations.
