() The hour of the probationary calibration error test (§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii)), if conditional data validation is used and all of the certification tests are successfully completed in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, with no test failures. If any required test is failed or aborted or is otherwise not in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, data validation shall be done according to § 75.20(b)(3)(vii).

(f) In accordance with § 75.20, the owner or operator of an affected gas-fired or oil-fired peaking unit, if planning to use appendix E of this part, shall ensure that the required certification tests for excepted monitoring systems under appendix E are completed for backup fuel, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, no later than 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days (whichever occurs first) after the date that the unit first combusts the backup fuel following the certification testing with the primary fuel. If the required testing is completed by this deadline, the appendix E correlation curve derived from the test results may be used for reporting data under this part beginning with the first date and hour that the backup fuel is combusted, provided that the fuel flowmeter for the backup fuel was certified as of that date and hour. If the required appendix E testing has not been successfully completed by the compliance date in this paragraph, then, until the testing is completed, the owner or operator shall report NOemission rate data for all unit operating hours that the backup fuel is combusted using either:

(1) The fuel-specific maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter; or

(2) Reference methods under § 75.22(b) of this part; or

(3) Another procedure approved by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under § 75.66.

(g) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply unless an owner or operator is exempt from certifying a fuel flowmeter for use during combustion of emergency fuel under section 2.1.4.3 of appendix D to this part, in which circumstance the provisions of section 2.1.4.3 of appendix D shall apply. In accordance with § 75.20, whenever the owner or operator of a gas-fired or oil-fired unit uses an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E of this part and combusts emergency fuel as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, then the owner or operator shall ensure that a fuel flowmeter measuring emergency fuel is installed and the required certification tests for excepted monitoring systems are completed by no later than 30 unit operating days after the first date after January 1, 1995 that the unit combusts emergency fuel. For all unit operating hours that the unit combusts emergency fuel after January 1, 1995 until the owner or operator installs a flowmeter for emergency fuel and successfully completes all required certification tests, the owner or operator shall determine and report SOmass emission data using either:

(1) The maximum potential fuel flow rate, as described in appendix D of this part, and the maximum sulfur content of the fuel, as described in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A of this part;

(2) Reference methods under § 75.22(b) of this part; or

(3) Another procedure approved by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under § 75.66.

(h) [Reserved]

(i) In accordance with § 75.20, the owner or operator of each affected unit at which SOconcentration is measured on a dry basis or at which moisture corrections are required to account for COemissions, NOemission rate in lb/mmBtu, heat input, or NOmass emissions for units in a NOmass reduction program, shall ensure that the continuous moisture monitoring system required by this part is installed and that all applicable initial certification tests required under § 75.20(c)(5), (c)(6), or (c)(7) for the continuous moisture monitoring system are completed no later than the following dates:

(1) April 1, 2000, for a unit that is existing and has commenced commercial operation by January 2, 2000;

(2) For a new affected unit which has not commenced commercial operation by January 2, 2000, 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days (whichever occurs first) after the date the unit commences commercial operation; or

(3) For an existing unit that is shutdown and is not yet operating by April 1, 2000, 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days (whichever occurs first) after the date that the unit recommences commercial operation.

(j) If the certification tests required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section have not been completed by the applicable compliance date, the owner or operator shall determine and report SOconcentration, NOemission rate, COconcentration, and flow rate data for all unit operating hours after the applicable compliance date in this paragraph until all required certification tests are successfully completed using either:

(1) The maximum potential concentration of SO, as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part, the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum potential COconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part;

(2) Reference methods under § 75.22(b); or

(3) Another procedure approved by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under § 75.66.
