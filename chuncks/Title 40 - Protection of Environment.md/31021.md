() A combustion control device demonstrating during the performance test under ยง 63.1282(d) that combustion zone temperature is an indicator of destruction efficiency and operates at a minimum temperature of 760 degrees C.

(4) For a condenser design analysis conducted to meet the requirements of ยง 63.1281(d)(1), (e)(3)(ii), or (f)(1), the owner or operator shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Documentation of the design analysis shall be submitted as a part of the Notification of Compliance Status Report as required in ยง 63.1285(d)(1)(i).

(i) The condenser design analysis shall include an analysis of the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flowrate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design outlet organic compound concentration level, design average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet. As an alternative to the condenser design analysis, an owner or operator may elect to use the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

(A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flowrate and shall establish the design minimum and average temperatures in the combustion zone and the combustion zone residence time.

(B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flowrate and shall establish the design minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet, and the design service life of the catalyst.

(C) For a boiler or process heater, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flowrate; shall establish the design minimum and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time; and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone.

(D) For a condenser, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flowrate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design outlet organic compound concentration level, design average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet. As an alternative to the design analysis, an owner or operator may elect to use the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

(E) For a regenerable carbon adsorption, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flowrate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon beds, design total regeneration stream flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of the carbon.

(F) For a nonregenerable carbon adsorption system, such as a carbon canister, the design analysis shall include the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flowrate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule. In addition, these systems will incorporate dual carbon canisters in case of emission breakthrough occurring in one canister.

(ii) If the owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on a demonstration of control device performance using a design analysis, then the disagreement shall be resolved using the results of a performance test performed by the owner or operator in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The Administrator may choose to have an authorized representative observe the performance test.

(5) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to use the procedures documented in the GRI report entitled, "Atmospheric Rich/Lean Method for Determining Glycol Dehydrator Emissions," (GRI-95/0368.1) as inputs for the model GRI-GLYCalc, Version 3.0 or higher, to generate a condenser performance curve.
