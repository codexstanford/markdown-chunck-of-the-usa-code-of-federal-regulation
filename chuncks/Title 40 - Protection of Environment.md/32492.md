###### § 63.1430 Process vent reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
####### Records to demonstrate compliance.

(b)The owner or operator complying with the process vent control requirements in § 63.1425(b), (c), or (d) shall keep the following records, as applicable, readily accessible:

(1) When using a flare to comply with the process vent control requirements in § 63.1425(b)(2)(i), (c)(1)(i), (c)(3)(i), or (d)(1):

(i) The flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted, or non-assisted);

(ii) All visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate determinations, and exit velocity determinations made during the flare specification determination required by § 63.1437(c); and

(iii) All periods during the flare specification determination required by § 63.1437(c) when all pilot flames are absent.

(2) The following information when using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device (other than a flare) to achieve compliance with the process vent control requirements in § 63.1425(b), (c), or (d):

(i) For a combustion, recovery, or recapture device being used to comply with a percent reduction requirement of § 63.1425(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(3)(ii), or (d)(2), or the annual epoxide emission limitation in § 63.1425(b)(1)(iii) or (b)(2)(iv), the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC achieved, as determined using the procedures specified in the process vent requirements in § 63.1426;

(ii) For a combustion device being used to comply with an outlet concentration limitation of § 63.1425(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii), the concentration of organic HAP or TOC outlet of the combustion device, as determined using the procedures specified in the process vent requirements in § 63.1426;

(iii) For a boiler or process heater, a description of the location at which the process vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater;

(iv) For a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 megawatts and where the process vent stream is introduced with combustion air or is used as a secondary fuel and is not mixed with the primary fuel, the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC achieved, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.1426.
