(5)Any deterioration or malfunction occurring in an engine system or component directly intended to control emissions, including but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding any of the following levels: For 2007 through 2009 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or 3 times the applicable NOstandard, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.02 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2 times the applicable CO standard. A functional check, as described in paragraph (n)(6) of this section, may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (n)(5) provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that a malfunction would not cause emissions to exceed the applicable levels. This demonstration is subject to Administrator approval. For engines equipped with crankcase ventilation (CV), monitoring of the CV system is not necessary provided the manufacturer can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the CV system is unlikely to fail.
