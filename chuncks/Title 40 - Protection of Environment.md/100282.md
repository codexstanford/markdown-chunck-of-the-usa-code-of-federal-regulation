####### Test configuration.

(b)Select a powertrain for testing as described in ยง 1037.235 or 40 CFR 1036.235 as applicable. Set up the engine according to 40 CFR 1065.110 and 40 CFR 1065.405(b). Set the engine's idle speed to idle speed defined in ยง 1037.520(h)(1).

(1) The default test configuration consists of a powertrain with all components upstream of the axle. This involves connecting the powertrain's output shaft directly to the dynamometer or to a gear box with a fixed gear ratio and measuring torque at the axle input shaft. You may instead set up the dynamometer to connect at the wheel hubs and measure torque at that location. The preceeding sentence may apply if your powertrain configuration requires it, such as for hybrid powertrains or if you want to represent the axle performance with powertrain test results.

(2) For testing hybrid engines, connect the engine's crankshaft directly to the dynamometer and measure torque at that location.
