####### Multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.

(2)Use a multiplicative deterioration factor if good engineering judgment calls for the deterioration factor for a pollutant to be the ratio of exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life to exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. For example, if you use aftertreatment technology that controls emissions of a pollutant proportionally to engine-out emissions, it is often appropriate to use a multiplicative deterioration factor. Adjust the official emission results for each tested locomotive at the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. The deteriorated emission level is intended to represent the highest emission level during the useful life. Thus, if the factor is less than one, use one. A multiplicative deterioration factor may not be appropriate in cases where testing variability is significantly greater than locomotive-to-locomotive variability. Multiplicative deterioration factors must be specified to one more significant figure than the applicable standard.
