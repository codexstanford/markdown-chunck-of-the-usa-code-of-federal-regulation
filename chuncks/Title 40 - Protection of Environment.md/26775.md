###### ยง 63.505 Parameter monitoring levels and excursions.
####### Parameter monitoring excursion definitions.

(g)(1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies continuous monitoring), continuous front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, back-end process operations complying with ยง 63.494(a)(1) through (3) through the use of control or recovery devices, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iii) of this section.

(i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.

(ii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section, to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.

(iii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.

(iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under ยง 63.506(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made during the hour.

(v) The periods listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (g)(1)(v)(E) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section.

(A) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or

(B) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.

(2) With respect to batch front-end process vents, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either paragraph (g)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

(i) When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the given parameters.

(ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A) through (g)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.

(A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device.

(B) Subtract the time during the periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments from the total amount of time determined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient.
