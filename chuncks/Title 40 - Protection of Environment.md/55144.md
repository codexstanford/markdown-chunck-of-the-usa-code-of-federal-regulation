####### Temperature criteria for tidal waters in Indian lands.

(d)(1) The maximum acceptable cumulative increase in the weekly average temperature resulting from all artificial sources is 1 &#xB0;C (1.8 &#xB0;F) during all seasons of the year, provided that the summer maximum is not exceeded.

(i) Weekly average temperature increase shall be compared to baseline thermal conditions and shall be calculated using the daily maxima averaged over a 7-day period.

(ii) Baseline thermal conditions shall be measured at or modeled from a site where there is no artificial thermal addition from any source, and which is in reasonable proximity to the thermal discharge (within 5 miles), and which has similar hydrography to that of the receiving waters at the discharge.

(2) Natural temperature cycles characteristic of the waterbody segment shall not be altered in amplitude or frequency.

(3) During the summer months (for the period from May 15 through September 30), water temperatures shall not exceed a weekly average summer maximum threshold of 18 &#xB0;C (64.4 &#xB0;F) (calculated using the daily maxima averaged over a 7-day period).
