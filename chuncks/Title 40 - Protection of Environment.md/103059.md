###### ยง 1065.590 PM sampling media (e.g., filters) preconditioning and tare weighing.
####### e.g.,

(5) Weigh an unused sample medium (a new filter), record the stable balance reading and record the balance environment's dewpoint, ambient temperature, and atmospheric pressure.

(6) Reweigh the substitution weight and record the stable balance reading.

(7) Calculate the arithmetic mean of the two substitution-weight readings that you recorded immediately before and after weighing the unused sample. Subtract that mean value from the unused sample reading, then add the true mass of the substitution weight as stated on the substitution-weight certificate. Record this result. This is the unused sample's tare weight without correcting for buoyancy.

(8) Repeat these substitution-weighing steps for the remainder of your unused sample media.

(9) Once weighing is completed, follow the instructions given in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section.
