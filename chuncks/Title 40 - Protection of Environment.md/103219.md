####### W

(1) A value proportional to total work,, when you choose to determine brake-specific emissions as described in ยง 1065.650(f).

(2) Raw exhaust molar flow rate either from measured intake air molar flow rate or from fuel mass flow rate as described in paragraph (f) of this section.

(3) Raw exhaust molar flow rate from measured intake air molar flow rate and dilute exhaust molar flow rate, as described in paragraph (g) of this section.

(4) The amount of water in a raw or diluted exhaust flow, &#x3C7;, when you do not measure the amount of water to correct for the amount of water removed by a sampling system. Correct for removed water according to ยง 1065.659.

(5) The calculated total dilution air flow when you do not measure dilution air flow to correct for background emissions as described in ยง 1065.667(c) and (d).
