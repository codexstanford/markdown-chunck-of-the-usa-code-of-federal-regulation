###### § 63.867 Reporting requirements.
####### Additional reporting requirements for HAP metals standards.

(b)(1) Any owner or operator of a group of process units in a chemical recovery system at a mill complying with the PM emissions limits in § 63.862(a)(1)(ii) must submit the PM emissions limits determined in § 63.865(a) for each affected kraft or soda recovery furnace, smelt dissolving tank, and lime kiln to the Administrator for approval. The emissions limits must be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under subpart A of this part.

(2) Any owner or operator of a group of process units in a chemical recovery system at a mill complying with the PM emissions limits in § 63.862(a)(1)(ii) must submit the calculations and supporting documentation used in § 63.865(a)(1) and (2) to the Administrator as part of the notification of compliance status required under subpart A of this part.

(3) After the Administrator has approved the emissions limits for any process unit, the owner or operator of a process unit must notify the Administrator before any of the actions in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section are taken:

(i) The air pollution control system for any process unit is modified or replaced;

(ii) Any kraft or soda recovery furnace, smelt dissolving tank, or lime kiln in a chemical recovery system at a kraft or soda pulp mill complying with the PM emissions limits in § 63.862(a)(1)(ii) is shut down for more than 60 consecutive days;

(iii) A continuous monitoring parameter or the value or range of values of a continuous monitoring parameter for any process unit is changed; or

(iv) The black liquor solids firing rate for any kraft or soda recovery furnace during any 24-hour averaging period is increased by more than 10 percent above the level measured during the most recent performance test.

(4) An owner or operator of a group of process units in a chemical recovery system at a mill complying with the PM emissions limits in § 63.862(a)(1)(ii) and seeking to perform the actions in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section must recalculate the overall PM emissions limit for the group of process units and resubmit the documentation required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the Administrator. All modified PM emissions limits are subject to approval by the Administrator.
