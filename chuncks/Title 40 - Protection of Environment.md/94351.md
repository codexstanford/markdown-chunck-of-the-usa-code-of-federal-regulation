###### ยง 761.130 Sampling requirements.

Postcleanup sampling is required to verify the level of cleanup under ยง 761.125(c) (2) through (4). The responsible party may use any statistically valid, reproducible, sampling scheme (either random samples or grid samples) provided that the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are satisfied.

(a) The sampling area is the greater of (1) an area equal to the area cleaned plus an additional 1-foot boundary, or (2) an area 20 percent larger than the original area of contamination.

(b) The sampling scheme must ensure 95 percent confidence against false positives.

(c) The number of samples must be sufficient to ensure that areas of contamination of a radius of 2 feet or more within the sampling area will be detected, except that the minimum number of samples is 3 and the maximum number of samples is 40.

(d) The sampling scheme must include calculation for expected variability due to analytical error.
