####### ยง 53.64 Test procedure: Static fractionator test.
######## Calculate the aerosol spatial uniformity in the chamber.

(5)(i) Determine the quantity of material collected with each total filter sampler in the array using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for each total filter sampler as:

(ii) Calculate and record the mean mass concentration as:

(iii) (A) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation of the total mass concentration as:

(B) If the value of CVexceeds 10 percent, then the particle concentration uniformity is unacceptable, alterations to the static chamber test apparatus must be made, and steps in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section must be repeated.
