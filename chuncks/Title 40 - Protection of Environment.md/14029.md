() The type of fuel burned in the heaters and boilers during such time periods.

(C) Beginning June 20, 2008, MSCC shall measure the HS content of the fuel burned when fuel other than natural gas is burned in a heater or boiler that is exhausting to the SRU 30-meter stack. MSCC shall begin measuring the HS content of the fuel at the fuel header within one (1) hour from when any heater or boiler begins exhausting to the SRU 30-meter stack and on a once-per-3-hour period frequency until no heater or boiler is exhausting to the SRU 30-meter stack. To determine the HS content of the fuel burned, MSCC shall use length-of-stain detector tubes pursuant to ASTM Method D4810-06, "Standard Test Method for Hydrogen Sulfide in Natural Gas Using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes" (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) with the appropriate sample tube range. If the results exceed the tube's range, another tube of a higher range must be used until results are in the tube's range.

(6) Data reporting requirements:

(i) MSCC shall submit quarterly reports beginning with the first calendar quarter following May 21, 2008. The quarterly reports shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. The quarterly reports shall be submitted to EPA at the following address: Air Program Contact, EPA Montana Operations Office, Federal Building, 10 West 15th Street, Suite 3200, Helena, MT 59626.

(ii) The electronic report shall be on magnetic or optical media, and such submittal shall follow the reporting format of electronic data being submitted to the MDEQ. EPA may modify the reporting format delineated in this section, and, thereafter, MSCC shall follow the revised format. In addition to submitting the electronic quarterly reports to EPA, MSCC shall also record, organize, and archive for at least five (5) years the same data, and upon request by EPA, MSCC shall provide EPA with any data archived in accordance with this provision. The electronic report shall contain the following:

(A) Hourly average total sulfur concentrations as HS or SOin ppm, in the gas stream to the flare(s);

(B) Hourly average HS concentrations of the flare pilot and purge gases in ppm;

(C) Hourly average SOconcentrations in ppm from the SRU 100-meter stack;

(D) Hourly average volumetric flow rates in SCFH in the gas stream to the flare(s) and in the SRU 100-meter stack;

(E) Hourly average volumetric flow rates in SCFH of the flare pilot and purge gases;

(F) Hourly average temperature (in (F) and pressure (in mm or inches of Hg) in the gas stream to the flare(s);

(G) Hourly emissions in pounds per clock hour from the flare(s) and SRU 100-meter stack;

(H) Daily calibration data for all flare CEMS, all pilot gas and purge gas CEMS, and the SRU 100-meter stack CEMS;

(iii) The quarterly written report shall contain the following information:

(A) The 3-hour emissions in pounds per 3-hour period from the flare(s) and SRU 100-meter stack, and 3-hour HS concentrations in the fuel burned in the heaters and boilers described in paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section while any of these units is exhausting to the SRU 30-meter stack or auxiliary vent stacks and burning fuel other than natural gas;

(B) Periods in which only natural gas or an inert gas was used as flare pilot gas or purge gas or both;

(C) Daily emissions in pounds per calendar day from the SRU 100-meter stack;

(D) Annual emissions of SOin pounds per calendar year from the SRU 100-meter stack;

(E) The results of all quarterly Cylinder Gas Audits (CGA), Relative Accuracy Audits (RAA) and annual Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA) for all total sulfur analyzer(s), all HS analyzer(s), and the SRU 100-meter stack CEMS, and the results of all annual calibrations and verifications for the volumetric flow, temperature, and pressure monitors;

(F) For all periods of flare volumetric flow rate monitoring system or total sulfur analyzer system downtime, SRU 100-meter CEMS downtime, flare pilot gas or purge gas volumetric flow or HS analyzer system downtime, failure to obtain or analyze a grab or integrated sample, or failure to obtain an HS concentration sample as required by paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(C) and (g)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the written report shall identify:
