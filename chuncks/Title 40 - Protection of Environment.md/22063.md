###### 8.1 Sampling Site and Sampling Points.

You must follow the procedures of section 8.1 of Method 7E to determine the appropriate sampling points, unless you are using Method 3A only to determine the stack gas molecular weight and for no other purpose. In that case, you may use single-point integrated sampling as described in section 8.2.1 of Method 3. If the stratification test provisions in section 8.1.2 of Method 7E are used to reduce the number of required sampling points, the alternative acceptance criterion for 3-point sampling will be +/-0.5 percent COor O, and the alternative acceptance criterion for single-point sampling will be +/-0.3 percent COor O. In that case, you may use single-point integrated sampling as described in section 8.2.1 of Method 3.
