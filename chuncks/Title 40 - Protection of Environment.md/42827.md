######### Gas-fired or oil-fired peaking units.

(d)The owner or operator of an affected unit that qualifies as a peaking unit and as either gas-fired or oil-fired, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, based on information submitted by the designated representative in the monitoring plan, shall either:

(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; or

(2) Use the procedures in appendix D to this part for determining hourly heat input and the procedure specified in appendix E to this part for estimating hourly NOemission rate. However, for a common pipe configuration, the heat input apportionment provisions in section 2.1.2 of appendix D to this part shall not be used to meet the NOmass reporting provisions of this subpart unless all of the units served by the common pipe are affected units and have similar efficiencies. In addition, if after certification of an excepted monitoring system under appendix E to this part, the operation of a unit that reports emissions on an annual basis under § 75.74(a) of this part exceeds a capacity factor of 20.0 percent in any calendar year or exceeds an annual capacity factor of 10.0 percent averaged over three years, or the operation of a unit that reports emissions on an ozone season basis under § 75.74(b) of this part exceeds a capacity factor of 20.0 percent in any ozone season or exceeds an ozone season capacity factor of 10.0 percent averaged over three years, the owner or operator shall meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section by no later than December 31 of the following calendar year. If the required CEMS are not installed and certified by that date, the owner or operator shall report hourly NOmass emissions as the product of the maximum potential NOemission rate (MER) and the maximum hourly heat input of the unit (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), starting with the first unit operating hour after the deadline and continuing until the CEMS are provisionally certified.
