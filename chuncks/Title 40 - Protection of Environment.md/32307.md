####### 2

() For flares, the records specified in Table 3 of this subpart shall be maintained in place of continuous records.

(B) Records of the daily average value of each continuously monitored parameter, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) Each owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream that uses a control device to comply with paragraph § 63.1408(a)(1) or (2) of this section shall keep the following records, as applicable, readily accessible:

(A) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator for bypass lines specified in § 63.1415(d) was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour. Also, records of the times and durations of periods when the vent is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator specified in § 63.1415(d) is not operating.

(B) Where a seal or closure mechanism is used to comply with § 63.1415(d), hourly records of whether a diversion was detected at any time are not required. The owner or operator shall record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line damper or valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.

(C) Records specifying the times and duration of periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments. In addition, records specifying any other periods of process or control device operation when monitors are not operating.

(iii) Each owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream seeking to demonstrate compliance with the alternative standard, as specified in § 63.1408(b), shall keep the records of continuous emissions monitoring described in § 63.1416(c).

(iv) Each owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream seeking to demonstrate compliance with the mass emission limits, specified in § 63.1408(b)(2), shall keep the following records, as applicable, readily accessible:

(A) The rolling average monthly emission rate or the 12-month rolling average monthly emission rate, as appropriate.

(B) If there is a deviation from the emission limit, as specified in § 63.1413(i)(1), the individual monthly emission rate data points making up the rolling average monthly emission rate or the 12-month rolling average monthly emission rate, as appropriate.

(C) If it becomes necessary to redetermine (E) for a reactor batch process vent, as specified in § 63.1413(e)(2), the new value(s) for (E).
