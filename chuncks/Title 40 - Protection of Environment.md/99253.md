####### Crankcase emissions.

(a)Crankcase emissions may not be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere from any locomotive, except as follows:

(1) Locomotives may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing. If you take advantage of this exception, you must do both of the following things:

(i) Manufacture the locomotives so that all crankcase emissions can be routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part 1065, consistent with good engineering judgment.

(ii) Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when determining exhaust deterioration factors.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere.
