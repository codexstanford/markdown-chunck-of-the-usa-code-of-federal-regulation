(g)shall mean the Board within the Agency described in ยง 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in appeals filed under subparts B and C of this part. An appeal directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion under subparts B and C to the Administrator when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all of the parties shall be so notified and the rules in subparts B and C referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.
