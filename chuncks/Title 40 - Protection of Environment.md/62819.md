(c)(1) For rail car pass-by tests, the microphone shall be positioned on a line perpendicular to the track 30 meters (100 feet) from the track centerline.

(2) Rail car noise measurements shall be made when the locomotives have passed a distance 152.4 meters (500 feet) or 10 rail cars beyond the point at the intersection of the track and the line which extends perpendicularly from the track to the microphone location, providing any other locomotives are also at least 152.4 meters (500 feet) or 10 rail car lengths away from the measuring point. The maximum sound level observed in this manner which exceeds the noise levels specified in ยง 201.13 shall be utilized for compliance purposes.
