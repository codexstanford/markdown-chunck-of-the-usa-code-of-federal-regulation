###### LOAEL to NOAEL Extrapolations (UF

F.). In those cases in which a NOAEL is unavailable as the TD and a LOAEL is available, the LOAEL may be used to estimate the NOAEL. If used, the LOAEL shall be divided by an UF to estimate a NOAEL for use in deriving WVs. The value of the UF shall not be less than one and should not exceed 10, depending on the dose-response curve and any other available data, and is represented by UFin the equation expressed in Section II.A of this appendix. Guidance for selecting an appropriate UF, based on a review of available wildlife toxicity data, is available in the Wildlife TSD.
