######## Report of relocation.

(1)After your source has been registered, you must report any relocation of your source to the reviewing authority in writing no later than 30 days prior to the relocation of the source. Unless otherwise specified in an existing permit, a report of relocation shall be provided as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. In either case, the permit application for the new location satisfies the report of relocation requirement.

(i) Where the relocation results in a change in the reviewing authority for your source, you must submit a report of relocation to the current reviewing authority and a permit application to the new reviewing authority.

(ii) Where the reviewing authority remains the same, a report of relocation is fulfilled through the permit application for the new location.
