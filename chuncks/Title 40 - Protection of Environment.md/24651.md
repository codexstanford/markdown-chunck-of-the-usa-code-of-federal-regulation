####### ยง 62.15210 How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into appropriate averaging times and units?

(a) Use the equation in ยง 62.15390(a) to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.

(b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.

(c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.

(d) Use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
