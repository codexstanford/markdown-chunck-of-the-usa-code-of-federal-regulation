####### Payment for scheduled maintenance.

(g)Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines, which generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, you may commit to paying for scheduled maintenance as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section to demonstrate that the maintenance will occur. You may also schedule maintenance not otherwise allowed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section if you pay for it. You must pay for scheduled maintenance on any component during the useful life if it meets all the following conditions:

(1) Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before 1980.

(2) The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.

(3) The cost of the maintenance is more than 2 percent of the price of the engine.

(4) Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.
