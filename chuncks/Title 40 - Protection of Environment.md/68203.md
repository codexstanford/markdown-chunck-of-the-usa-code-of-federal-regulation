####### Alternative HC limit for industrial furnaces with organic matter in raw materials.

(b)Owners and operators of industrial furnaces requesting an alternative HC limit under ยง 266.104(f) of this chapter shall submit the following information at a minimum:

(1) Documentation that the furnace is designed and operated to minimize HC emissions from fuels and raw materials;

(2) Documentation of the proposed baseline flue gas HC (and CO) concentration, including data on HC (and CO) levels during tests when the facility produced normal products under normal operating conditions from normal raw materials while burning normal fuels and when not burning hazardous waste;

(3) Test burn protocol to confirm the baseline HC (and CO) level including information on the type and flow rate of all feedstreams, point of introduction of all feedstreams, total organic carbon content (or other appropriate measure of organic content) of all nonfuel feedstreams, and operating conditions that affect combustion of fuel(s) and destruction of hydrocarbon emissions from nonfuel sources;

(4) Trial burn plan to:

(i) Demonstrate that flue gas HC (and CO) concentrations when burning hazardous waste do not exceed the baseline HC (and CO) level; and

(ii) Identify the types and concentrations of organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, that are emitted when burning hazardous waste in conformance with procedures prescribed by the Director;

(5) Implementation plan to monitor over time changes in the operation of the facility that could reduce the baseline HC level and procedures to periodically confirm the baseline HC level; and

(6) Such other information as the Director finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.
