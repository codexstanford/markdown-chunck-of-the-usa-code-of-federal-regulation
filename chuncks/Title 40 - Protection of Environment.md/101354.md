####### Warranty period.

(b)Your emission-related warranty must be valid during the periods specified in this paragraph (b). You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for an engine may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component.
