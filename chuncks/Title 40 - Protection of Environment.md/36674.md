###### Initial Compliance Requirements
####### § 63.7326 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations that apply to me?

(a) For each coke oven battery subject to the emission limit for particulate matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions, you have demonstrated initial compliance if you meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section that apply to you.

(1) The concentration of particulate matter, measured in accordance with the performance test procedures in § 63.7322(b)(1) and (2), did not exceed 0.01 gr/dscf for a control device where a cokeside shed is used to capture pushing emissions or the process-weighted mass rate of particulate matter (lb/ton of coke), measured in accordance with the performance test procedures in § 63.7322(b)(1) through (4), did not exceed:

(i) 0.02 lb/ton of coke if a moveable hood vented to a stationary control device is used to capture emissions;

(ii) If a mobile scrubber car that does not capture emissions during travel is used, 0.03 lb/ton of coke from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a short coke oven battery or 0.01 lb/ton of coke from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a tall coke oven battery; and

(iii) 0.04 lb/ton of coke if a mobile control device that captures emissions during travel is used.

(2) For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you have established appropriate site-specific operating limits and have a record of the pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(a).

(3) For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you have established appropriate site-specific operating limits and have a record of the water pressure and temperature measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(b).

(4) For each capture system applied to pushing emissions, you have established an appropriate site-specific operating limit, and:

(i) If you elect the operating limit in § 63.7290(b)(3) for volumetric flow rate, you have a record of the total volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the control device measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(c)(1); or

(ii) If you elect the operating limit in § 63.7290(b)(3)(i) for fan motor amperes, you have a record of the fan motor amperes during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(c)(2); or

(iii) If you elect the operating limit in § 63.7290(b)(3)(ii) for static pressure or fan RPM, you have a record of the static pressure at the inlet of the control device or fan RPM measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(c)(3).

(5) For each multicyclone applied to pushing emissions, you have established an appropriate site-specific operating limit and have a record of the pressure drop measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7323(d).

(b) For each new or existing by-product coke oven battery subject to the opacity limit for stacks in § 63.7296(a), you have demonstrated initial compliance if the daily average opacity, as measured according to the performance test procedures in § 63.7324(b), is no more than 15 percent for a battery on a normal coking cycle or 20 percent for a battery on batterywide extended coking.

(c) For each new or existing by-product coke oven battery subject to the TDS limit or constituent limits for quench water in § 63.7295(a)(1),

(1) You have demonstrated initial compliance with the TDS limit in § 63.7295(a)(1)(i) if the TDS concentration, as measured according to the performance test procedures in § 63.7325(a), does not exceed 1,100 mg/L.

(2) You have demonstrated initial compliance with the constituent limit in § 63.7295(a)(1)(ii) if:

(i) You have established a site-specific constituent limit according to the procedures in § 63.7325(b); and

(ii) The sum of the constituent concentrations, as measured according to the performance test procedures in § 63.7325(c), is less than or equal to the site-specific limit.

(d) For each by-product coke oven battery stack subject to an opacity limit in § 63.7296(a) and each by-product coke oven battery subject to the requirements for quench water in § 63.7295(a)(1), you must submit a notification of compliance status containing the results of the COMS performance test for battery stacks and the quench water performance test (TDS or constituent limit) according to § 63.7340(e)(1). For each particulate matter emission limitation that applies to you, you must submit a notification of compliance status containing the results of the performance test according to § 63.7340(e)(2).
