###### § 86.1360 Supplemental emission test; test cycle and procedures.
####### Maximum allowable emission limits.

(f)(1) For gaseous emissions, the 12 non-idle test point results and the four-point linear interpolation procedure specified in paragraph (g) of this section for intermediate conditions, shall define Maximum Allowable Emission Limits for purposes of § 86.007-11(a)(3) except as modified under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Each engine shall have it's own Maximum Allowable Emission Limits generated from the 12 non-idle supplemental steady state test points from that engine. The control area extends from the 25% to the 75% engine speeds, at engine loads of 25% to 100%, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. Figure 1 of this paragraph (f)(1) depicts a sample Maximum Allowable Emission Limit curve, for illustration purposes only, as follows:

(2) If the weighted average emissions, calculated according to paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for any gaseous pollutant is equal to or lower than required by § 86.007-11(a)(3), each of the 13 test values for that pollutant shall first be multiplied by the ratio of the applicable emission standard (under § 86.007-11(a)(3)) to the weighted average emissions value, and then by 1.10 for interpolation allowance, before determining the Maximum Allowable Emission Limits under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

(3) If the Maximum Allowable Emission Limit for any point, as calculated under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, is greater than the applicable Not-to-Exceed limit (if within the Not-to-Exceed control area defined in § 86.1370(b)), then the Maximum Allowable Emission Limit for that point shall be defined as the applicable Not-to-Exceed limit.
