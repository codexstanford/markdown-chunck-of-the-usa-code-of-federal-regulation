(C) For model years 2013 through 2018, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, the OBD system must monitor continuously for engine misfire when positive torque is between 20 and 75 percent of peak torque, and engine speed is less than 75 percent of maximum engine speed. If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator approve the monitoring system nonetheless. In evaluating the manufacturer's request, the Administrator will consider the following factors: The magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (, the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions (, compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be based on the following misfire patterns: Equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and, paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.
