######## Generate aerosol.

(2)(i) Generate particles of a size specified in table F-2 of this subpart using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator.

(ii) Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator as necessary.

(iii) Calculate the physical particle size using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator and record.

(iv) Determine the particle's aerodynamic diameter from the calculated physical diameter and the known density of the generated particle. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be within the tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
