###### § 63.344 Performance test requirements and test methods.
####### Special compliance provisions for multiple sources controlled by a common add-on air pollution control device.

(e)(1) This section identifies procedures for measuring the outlet chromium concentration from an add-on air pollution control device that is used to control multiple sources that may or may not include sources not affected by this subpart.

(2) When multiple affected sources performing the same type of operation (e.g., all are performing hard chromium electroplating), and subject to the same emission limitation, are controlled with an add-on air pollution control device that is not controlling emissions from any other type of affected operation or from any nonaffected sources, the applicable emission limitation identified in § 63.342 must be met at the outlet of the add-on air pollution control device.

(3) When multiple affected sources performing the same type of operation and subject to the same emission limitation are controlled with a common add-on air pollution control device that is also controlling emissions from sources not affected by these standards, the following procedures should be followed to determine compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 63.342:

(i) Calculate the cross-sectional area of each inlet duct (i.e., uptakes from each hood) including those not affected by the standard.

(ii) Determine the total sample time per test run by dividing the total inlet area from all tanks connected to the control system by the total inlet area for all ducts associated with affected sources, and then multiply this number by 2 hours. The calculated time is the minimum sample time required per test run.

(iii) Perform Method 306 or 306A testing and calculate an outlet mass emission rate.

(iv) Determine the total ventilation rate from the affected sources (VR) by using equation 1:

(v) Establish the allowable mass emission rate of the system (AMR) in milligrams of total chromium per hour (mg/hr) using equation 2:

(4) When multiple affected sources performing different types of operations (e.g., hard chromium electroplating, decorative chromium electroplating, or chromium anodizing) are controlled by a common add-on air pollution control device that may or may not also be controlling emissions from sources not affected by these standards, or if the affected sources controlled by the common add-on air pollution control device perform the same operation but are subject to different emission limitations (e.g., because one is a new hard chromium plating tank and one is an existing small, hard chromium plating tank), the following procedures should be followed to determine compliance with the applicable emission limitation in § 63.342:

(i) Follow the steps outlined in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section.

(ii) Determine the total ventilation rate for each type of affected source (VR,a) using equation 3:

(iii) Establish the allowable mass emission rate in mg/hr for each type of affected source that is controlled by the add-on air pollution control device using equation 4, 5, 6, or 7 as appropriate:

(iv) Establish the allowable mass emission rate of the system (AMR) in milligrams of total chromium per hour (mg/hr) using equation 8, including each type of affected source as appropriate:

The allowable mass emission rate calculated from equation 8 should be equal to or more than the outlet three-run average mass emission rate determined from Method 306 or 306A testing in order for the source to be in compliance with the standards.

(5) Each owner or operator that uses the special compliance provisions of this paragraph to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations of § 63.342 shall submit the measurements and calculations to support these compliance methods with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.347(e).

(6) Each owner or operator that uses the special compliance provisions of this section to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations of § 63.342 shall repeat these procedures if a tank is added or removed from the control system regardless of whether that tank is a nonaffected source. If the new nonaffected tank replaces an existing nonaffected tank of the same size and is connected to the control system through the same size inlet duct then this procedure does not have to be repeated.
