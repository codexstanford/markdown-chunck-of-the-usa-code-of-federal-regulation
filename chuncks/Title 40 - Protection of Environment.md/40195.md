###### Record Sample Spectrum.

5.4Connect the sample line to the source. Either evacuate the absorption cell to an absolute pressure below 5 mmHg before extracting a sample from the effluent stream into the absorption cell, or pump at least ten cell volumes of sample through the cell before obtaining a sample. Record the sample pressure P. Generate the absorbance spectrum of the sample. Store the background and sample single beam interferograms, and document the process by which the absorbance spectra are generated from these data. (If necessary, apply the spectral transformations developed in section 5.6.2 of this addendum). The resulting sample spectrum is referred to below as S.
