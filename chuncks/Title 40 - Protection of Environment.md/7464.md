####### Review of major stationary sources and major modifications-source applicability and exemptions.

(c)(1) No stationary source or modification to which the requirements of this section apply shall begin actual construction without a permit which states that the stationary source or modification would meet those requirements. The Administrator has sole authority to issue any such permit unless the authority has been delegated pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section.

(2) The requirements of this section shall apply to construction of any new major stationary source or major modification that would both be constructed in an area classified as nonattainment under section 107(d)(1)(A), (B) or (C) of the Clean Air Act and potentially have an impact on visibility in any visibility protection area.

(3) The requirements of this section shall apply to any such major stationary source and any such major modification with respect to each pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act that it would emit, except as this section otherwise provides.

(4) The requirements of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source or major modification, if:

(i) The source or modification would be a nonprofit health or nonprofit educational institution, or a major modification would occur at such an institution, and the governor of the State in which the source or modification would be located requests that it be exempt from those requirements; or

(ii) The source or modification would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following categories:

(A) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers);

(B) Kraft pulp mills;

(C) Portland cement plants;

(D) Primary zinc smelters;

(E) Iron and steel mills;

(F) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants;

(G) Primary copper smelters;

(H) Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 250 tons of refuse per day;

(I) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants;

(J) Petroleum refineries;

(K) Lime plants;

(L) Phosphate rock processing plants;

(M) Coke oven batteries;

(N) Sulfur recovery plants;

(O) Carbon black plants (furnace process);

(P) Primary lead smelters;

(Q) Fuel conversion plants;

(R) Sintering plants;

(S) Secondary metal production plants;

(T) Chemical process plants;

(U) Fossil-fuel boiler (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input;

(V) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels;

(W) Taconite ore processing plants;

(X) Glass fiber processing plants;

(Y) Charcoal production plants;

(Z) Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input;

(AA) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Act; or

(iii) The source is a portable stationary source which has previously received a permit under this section, and

(A) The owner or operator proposes to relocate the source and emissions of the source at the new location would be temporary; and

(B) The emissions from the source would not exceed its allowable emissions; and

(C) The emissions from the source would impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and

(D) Reasonable notice is given to the Administrator, prior to the relocation, identifying the proposed new location and the probable duration of operation at the new location. Such notice shall be given to the Administrator not less than 10 days in advance of the proposed relocation, unless a different time duration is previously approved by the Administrator.

(5) The requirements of this section shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates that, as to that pollutant, the source or modification is located in an area designated as attainment under section 107 of the Clean Air Act.

(6) The requirements of this section shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant, if the allowable emissions of that pollutant from the source, or the net emissions increase of that pollutant from the modification:

(i) Would impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated, and

(ii) Would be temporary.
