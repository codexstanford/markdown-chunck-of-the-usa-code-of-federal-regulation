####### Vehicle/component selection method.

(b)The manufacturer shall determine a vehicle and component selection procedure which results in representative test vehicles and reflects good engineering judgment.

(c) The manufacturer shall calculate a deterioration factor which is applied to the evaporative emission results of the emission data vehicles. The deterioration factor shall be based on a linear regression, or an other regression technique approved in advance by the Administrator. The DF will be calculated to be the difference between the full life mileage evaporative level minus the stabilized mileage (e.g., 4000-mile) evaporative level from the regression analysis. The DF and the full and stabilized mileage emission levels shall be rounded to two decimal places of accuracy in accordance with the Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with Specifications (incorporated by reference, see ยง 86.1(b)(1). Calculated DF values of less than zero shall be changed to zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
