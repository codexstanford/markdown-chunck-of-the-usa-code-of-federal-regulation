###### ยง 1054.112 What evaporative emission standards must my nonhandheld equipment meet?
####### Tank permeation.

(b)Fuel tanks must meet the permeation requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.103. Equipment manufacturers may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b) under the averaging, banking, and trading program as described in subpart H of this part. Starting in the 2014 model year for Class II equipment and in the 2015 model year for Class I equipment, the following FEL caps represent the maximum values for family emission limits that you may use for your fuel tanks:

(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, you may not use fuel tanks with a family emission limit that exceeds 5.0 g/m/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 28 &#xB0;C, or 8.3 g/m/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 40 &#xB0;C.

(2) For small-volume emission families, you may not use fuel tanks with a family emission limit that exceeds 8.0 g/m/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 28 &#xB0;C, or 13.3 g/m/day for testing at a nominal temperature of 40 &#xB0;C.

(3) FEL caps do not apply to fuel caps that are certified separately to meet permeation standards.
