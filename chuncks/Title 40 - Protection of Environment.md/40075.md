###### Sampling and Analysis.

2.2In extractive sampling a probe assembly and pump are used to extract gas from the exhaust of the affected source and transport the sample to the FTIR gas cell. Typically, the sampling apparatus is similar to that used for single-component continuous emission monitor (CEM) measurements.

2.2.1 The digitized infrared spectrum of the sample in the FTIR gas cell is measured and stored on a computer. Absorbance band intensities in the spectrum are related to sample concentrations by what is commonly referred to as Beer's Law.

2.2.2 Analyte spiking is used for quality assurance (QA). In this procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) an analyte is spiked into the gas stream at the back end of the sample probe. Analyte concentrations in the spiked samples are compared to analyte concentrations in unspiked samples. Since the concentration of the spike is known, this procedure can be used to determine if the sampling system is removing the spiked analyte(s) from the sample stream.
