####### ยง 63.11237 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Hot water heater,i.e.,

means a closed vessel with a capacity of no more than 120 U.S. gallons in which water is heated by combustion of gaseous, liquid, or biomass fuel and hot water is withdrawn for use external to the vessel. Hot water boilers (not generating steam) combusting gaseous, liquid, or biomass fuel with a heat input capacity of less than 1.6 million Btu per hour are included in this definition. The 120 U.S. gallon capacity threshold to be considered a hot water heater is independent of the 1.6 million Btu per hour heat input capacity threshold for hot water boilers. Hot water heater also means a tankless unit that provides on-demand hot water.
