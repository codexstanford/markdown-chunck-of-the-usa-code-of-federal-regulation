###### ยง 1066.630 PDP, SSV, and CFV flow rate calculations.

This section describes the equations for calculating flow rates from various flow meters. After you calibrate a flow meter according to ยง 1066.625, use the calculations described in this section to calculate flow during an emission test. Calculate flow according to 40 CFR 1065.642 instead if you calculate emissions based on molar flow rates.
