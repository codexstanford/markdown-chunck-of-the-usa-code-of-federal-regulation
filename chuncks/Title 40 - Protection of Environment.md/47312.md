####### Provided,

(a) Certification test results, pursuant to ยง 86.082-23, exceed the emission standard for a particular pollutant but do not exceed the upper limit established for that pollutant. In that event, the manufacturer will be offered a qualified certificate of conformity allowing for the introduction into commerce of the specified engine family,That:

(1) The manufacturer must agree to conduct a PCA of those engines or vehicles;

(2) PCA testing must be conducted on the same configurations that exceeded the standard in certification. In lieu of that requirement, the Administrator may approve testing of a greater or lesser number of configurations provided the manufacturer agrees to pay the NCP determined from the CL of each tested configuration for that configuration and for other non-tested configurations that have similar emission characteristics. If an acceptable showing of similar emission characteristics is not made, the highest CL of the configurations tested will apply to all non-tested configurations exceeding the standard.

(3) The selection of engines or vehicles for PCA testing must be initiated no later than five (5) days after the start of assembly-line production of the specified engine or vehicle configuration, unless that period is extended by the Administrator;

(4) The manufacturer must agree:

(i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on each engine or vehicle, unless the manufacturer successfully challenges the Administrator's determination of the compliance level or penalty calculation or both under ยง 86.1115-87(c);

(ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce, without invoking the procedural requirements of section 207(c) of the Clean Air Act, if the compliance level for the engine or vehicle configuration of (a)(2) exceeds the upper limit as determined by the PCA;

(5) If the compliance level determined in the PCA is below the emission standard, no NCP will be offered, and all appropriate qualifications will be removed from the qualified certificate of conformity.
