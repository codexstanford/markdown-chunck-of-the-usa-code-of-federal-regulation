#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart L - National Emission Standards for Coke Oven Batteries
###### § 63.310 Requirements for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.

(a) At all times including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain the coke oven battery and its pollution control equipment required under this subpart, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the levels required by any applicable performance standards under this subpart. Failure to adhere to the requirement of this paragraph shall not constitute a separate violation if a violation of an applicable performance or work practice standard has also occurred.

(b) Each owner or operator of a coke oven battery shall develop, according to paragraph (c) of this section, a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes procedures for operating the battery, including associated air pollution control equipment, during a period of a startup, shutdown, or malfunction in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions, and procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable.

(c) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practicable after their occurrence.

(d) In order for the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section to apply with respect to the observation (or set of observations) for a particular day, notification of a startup, shutdown, or a malfunction shall be made by the owner or operator:

(1) If practicable, to the certified observer if the observer is at the facility during the occurrence; or

(2) To the enforcement agency, in writing, within 24 hours of the occurrence first being documented by a company employee, and if the notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section was not made, an explanation of why no such notification was made.

(e) Within 14 days of the notification made under paragraph (d) of this section, or after a startup or shutdown, the owner or operator shall submit a written report to the applicable permitting authority that:

(1) Describes the time and circumstances of the startup, shutdown, or malfunction; and

(2) Describes actions taken that might be considered inconsistent with the startup, shutdown, or malfunction plan.

(f) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of internal reports which form the basis of each malfunction notification under paragraph (d) of this section.

(g) To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the standard operating procedures manual for the battery, provided the manual meets all the requirements for this section and is made available for inspection at reasonable times when requested by the Administrator.

(h) The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan:

(1) Does not address a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event that has occurred;

(2) Fails to provide for the operation of the source (including associated air pollution control equipment) during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions; or

(3) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable.

(i) If the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a startup, shutdown, or malfunction has occurred, then an observation occurring during such startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not:

(1) Constitute a violation of relevant requirements of this subpart;

(2) Be used in any compliance determination under § 63.309; or

(3) Be considered for purposes of § 63.306, until the Administrator has resolved the claim that a startup, shutdown, or malfunction has occurred. If the Administrator determines that a startup, shutdown, or malfunction has not occurred, such observations may be used for purposes of § 63.306, regardless of whether the owner or operator further contests such determination. The owner's or operator's receipt of written notification from the Administrator that a startup, shutdown, or malfunction has not occurred will serve, where applicable under § 63.306, as written notification from the certified observer that an exceedance has occurred.

(j) The owner or operator of a nonrecovery coke oven battery subject to the work practice standards for door leaks in § 63.303(c) shall include the information specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.

(1) Identification of potential malfunctions that will cause a door to leak, preventative maintenance procedures to minimize their occurrence, and corrective action procedures to stop the door leak.

(2) Identification of potential malfunctions that affect charging emissions, preventative maintenance procedures to minimize their occurrence, and corrective action procedures.
