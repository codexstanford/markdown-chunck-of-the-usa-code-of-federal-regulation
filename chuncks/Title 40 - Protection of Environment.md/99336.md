####### Installed APU tested separately.

(1)If you separately measure emission rates (g/hr) for each pollutant from the APU installed in the locomotive, you may use the measured emissions rates (g/hr) as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is operating. For all testing other than in-use testing, apply appropriate deterioration factors to the measured emission rates. You may ask to carryover APU emission data for a previous test, or use data for the same APU installed on locomotives in another engine family.
