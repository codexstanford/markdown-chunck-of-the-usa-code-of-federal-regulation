() Emissions from heating shall be calculated using either Equation 13 of this subpart or Equation 37 of this subpart. In Equation 13, the HAP vapor pressures shall be determined at the temperature of the receiver. In Equations 13 and 37 of this subpart, Δ&#x3B7; is equal to the number of moles of noncondensable displaced from the vessel, as calculated using Equation 15 of this subpart. In Equations 13 and 37 of this subpart, the HAP average molecular weight shall be calculated using Equation 17 with the HAP partial pressures determined at the temperature of the receiver.
