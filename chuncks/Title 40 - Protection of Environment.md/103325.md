####### General.

(a)Unless the standard-setting part specifies deviations from the provisions of this subpart, field testing and laboratory testing with PEMS must conform to the provisions of this subpart.

For example, this may require additional maintenance or calibration for field testing or may require verification after moving the PEMS unit.
