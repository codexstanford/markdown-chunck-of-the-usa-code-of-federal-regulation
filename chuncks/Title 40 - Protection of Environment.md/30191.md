######## 1,System removal efficiency.

()You must calculate a semivolatile metal system removal efficiency for each test run and calculate the average system removal efficiency of the test run averages. If emissions exceed the semivolatile metal emission standard during the comprehensive performance test, it is not a violation because the averaging period for the semivolatile metal emission standard is one year and compliance is based on compliance with the semivolatile metal feedrate limit that has an averaging period not to exceed an annual rolling average.
