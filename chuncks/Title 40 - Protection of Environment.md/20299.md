###### Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
####### ยง 60.2110 What operating limits must I meet and by when?

(a) If you use a wet scrubber(s) to comply with the emission limitations, you must establish operating limits for up to four operating parameters (as specified in table 2 of this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test:

(1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate:

(i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations; and

(ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.

(2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations;

(3) Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquid flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations; and

(4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limitation.

(b) You must meet the operating limits established during the initial performance test 60 days after your CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.

(c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a particulate matter (PM) continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for monitoring PM compliance, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.

(d) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric power value (secondary voltage x secondary current = secondary electric power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary electric power measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
