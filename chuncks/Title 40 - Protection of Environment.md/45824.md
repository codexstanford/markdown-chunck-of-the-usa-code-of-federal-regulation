####### For parts certifying on the basis of emission test results, certification compliance shall be demonstrated as follows.

(d)(1) The emission test to be used is the Federal Test Procedure as set forth in the applicable portions of 40 CFR part 86. Certification emission testing must be carried out using representative production aftermarket parts as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The test results must demonstrate that the proper installation of the certified aftermarket part will not cause the vehicle to fail to meet any applicable Federal emission requirements under section 202 of the Act.

(2) The following portions of the Federal Test Procedure are not required to be performed when certifying a part using emission testing:

(i) The evaporative emissions portion, if the aftermarket manufacturer has an adequate technical basis for believing that the part has no effect on the vehicle's evaporative emissions;

(ii) The exhaust emissions portion, if the part manufacturer has an adequate technical basis for believing that the part has no affect on the vehicle's exhaust emissions; and
