####### Determinations of attainment.

(2)The EPA has determined that the Calaveras County, Chico (Butte County), San Francisco Bay Area and Tuscan Buttes 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in California have attained the 2008 8-hour ozone standard by the July 20, 2015 applicable attainment date, based upon complete quality-assured data for 2012-2014. Therefore, the EPA has met its obligation pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. As a result of these determinations, the Calaveras County, Chico (Butte County), San Francisco Bay Area and Tuscan Buttes 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in California will not be reclassified for failure to attain by their July 20, 2015, applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
