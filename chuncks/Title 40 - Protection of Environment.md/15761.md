####### ยง 53.54 Test for proper sampler operation following power interruptions.
######## Required test equipment.

(b)(1) Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual volumetric sample flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.

(2) Ambient air temperature sensor (if needed for volumetric corrections to flow rate measurements), with a resolution of 0.1 &#xB0;C, certified accurate to within 0.5 &#xB0;C, and continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

(3) Barometer (if needed for volumetric corrections to flow rate measurements), range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 mm Hg, with continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

(4) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sample flow rate at the sampler downtube.

(5) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the filter.

(6) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L (if required).

(7) Time measurement system, accurate to within 10 seconds per day.
