####### ยง 63.6125 What are my monitor installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

(a) If you are operating a stationary combustion turbine that is required to comply with the formaldehyde emission limitation and you use an oxidation catalyst emission control device, you must monitor on a continuous basis your catalyst inlet temperature in order to comply with the operating limitations in Table 2 and as specified in Table 5 of this subpart.

(b) If you are operating a stationary combustion turbine that is required to comply with the formaldehyde emission limitation and you are not using an oxidation catalyst, you must continuously monitor any parameters specified in your approved petition to the Administrator, in order to comply with the operating limitations in Table 2 and as specified in Table 5 of this subpart.

(c) If you are operating a stationary combustion turbine which fires landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, or a stationary combustion turbine where gasified MSW is used to generate 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, you must monitor and record your fuel usage daily with separate fuel meters to measure the volumetric flow rate of each fuel. In addition, you must operate your turbine in a manner which minimizes HAP emissions.

(d) If you are operating a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart, and you use any quantity of distillate oil to fire any new or existing stationary combustion turbine which is located at the same major source, you must monitor and record your distillate oil usage daily for all new and existing stationary combustion turbines located at the major source with a non-resettable hour meter to measure the number of hours that distillate oil is fired.
