(v)(A) Formulation and sterilization of nutrient medium used for algal culture and preparation of test solutions should conform to those currently recommended by the U.S. EPA for freshwater and marine algal bioassays. No chelating agents are to be included in the nutrient medium used for test solution preparation. Nutrient medium should be freshly prepared for algal testing and may be dispensed in appropriate volumes in test containers and sterilized by autoclaving or filtration. The pH of the nutrient medium shall be 7.5 (+/-0.1) forand 8.1 (+/-0.1) forat the start of the test and may be adjusted prior to test chemical addition with 0.1N NaOH or HC1.

(B) Dilution water used for preparation of nutrient medium and test solutions should be filtered, deionized or glass distilled. Saltwater for marine algal nutrient medium and test solutions should be prepared by adding a commercial, synthetic, sea salt formulation or a modified synthetic seawater formulation to distilled/deionized water to a concentration of 30 parts per thousand.
