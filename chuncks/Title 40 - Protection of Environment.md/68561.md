(ii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 6D, 1997 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 63: Sections 63-2-103 through 63-2-105, 63-2-201 through 63-2-203 (except 63-2-203(10)), 63-2-204, 63-2-205, 63-2-301 through 63-2-308, 63-2-401 through 63-2-405, and 63-2-802.

(iii) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3, 1953 as amended 1987, Title 26, Chapter 14: Section 26-14-8.

(iv) Utah Administrative Code revised as of January 3, 1989: R450-3.1.1(b) & (c) and R450-3-2.4(b).

(v) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996: Sections R315-2-14, R315-3-3(i)(1)&(3), R315-3-11(a), (b) & (f), R315-3-16(b), R315-3-23(b)(1) & (2), R315-3-23(c) & (d), R315-3-24(a) through R315-3-29, and R315-3-34.

(vi) Utah Administrative Code revised as of May 15, 1996: Section R315-15-1.1(j) & (k).

(3) The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader-in-scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, and are not incorporated by reference:

(i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-6-105(3), 19-6-113(5), 19-6-118, 19-6-120, and 19-6-121.

(ii) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996. EPA considers Utah's listing of all P999 and some F999 wastes (specifically: nerve, military, and chemical agents) as more stringent than the Federal rule. To the extent that unused chemical agents, as produced, exhibit a hazardous waste reactivity characteristic, they are considered hazardous waste and, thus, are regulated under Federal rule. Utah's listing of these wastes enhances the degree of regulatory control regarding these wastes. EPA also considers Utah's rule as broader-in-scope than the federal rule for those F999 process wastes which do not exhibit a characteristic for hazardous waste and would not be regulated under Federal rule. R315-2-10(e)(1), 315-2-11(e) introductory paragraph and R315-2-11(e)(1) are broader-in-scope regarding these wastes.

(iii) Utah Administrative Code, as of May 15, 1996: R315-15-7.1(d), R315-15-10, R315-15-11 with respect to used oil transfer and off-specification used oil burning facilities, and R315-15-12 through R315-15-15 except R315-15-13.5(d).
