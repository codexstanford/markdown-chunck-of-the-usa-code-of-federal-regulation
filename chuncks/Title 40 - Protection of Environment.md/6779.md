###### Location of offsetting emissions.

D.The owner or operator of a new or modified major stationary source may comply with any offset requirement in effect under this Ruling for increased emissions of any air pollutant only by obtaining emissions reductions of such air pollutant from the same source or other sources in the same nonattainment area, except that the reviewing authority may allow the owner or operator of a source to obtain such emissions reductions in another nonattainment area if the conditions under paragraphs IV.D.1 and 2 of this Ruling are met.

1. The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the source is located.

2. Emissions from such other area contribute to a violation of the national ambient air quality standard in the nonattainment area in which the source is located.
