If you choose to withhold the location information from disclosure to the public, you must clearly indicate that the information is "confidential." You must provide the confidential location information on a separate sheet from the other Tier II information (which will be disclosed to the public), and attach the Confidential Location Information Sheet to the other Tier II information. Indicate any attachments you are including.

(t) An indication whether you are including any attachments (optional).
