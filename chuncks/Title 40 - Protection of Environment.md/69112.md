####### Methods of release detection for piping.

(2)Owners and operators of underground piping associated with field-constructed tanks less than or equal to 50,000 gallons must meet the release detection requirements in subpart D of this part. Owners and operators of underground piping associated with airport hydrant systems and field-constructed tanks greater than 50,000 gallons must follow either the requirements in subpart D (except § 280.43(e) and (f) must be combined with inventory control as stated below) or use one or a combination of the following alternative methods of release detection:

(i)(A) Perform a semiannual or annual line tightness test at or above the piping operating pressure in accordance with the table below.

(B) Piping segment volumes ≥100,000 gallons not capable of meeting the maximum 3.0 gallon per hour leak rate for the semiannual test may be tested at a leak rate up to 6.0 gallons per hour according to the following schedule:

(ii) Perform vapor monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) for a tracer compound placed in the tank system) capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years;

(iii) Perform inventory control (conducted in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 4140.25; ATA Airport Fuel Facility Operations and Maintenance Guidance Manual; or equivalent procedures) at least every 30 days that can detect a leak equal to or less than 0.5 percent of flow-through; and

(A) Perform a line tightness test (conducted in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section using the leak rates for the semiannual test) at least every two years; or

(B) Perform vapor monitoring or groundwater monitoring (conducted in accordance with § 280.43(e) or (f), respectively, for the stored regulated substance) at least every 30 days; or

(iv) Another method approved by the implementing agency if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability of detection.
