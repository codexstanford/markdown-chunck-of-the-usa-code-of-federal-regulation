###### ยง 1060.520 How do I test fuel tanks for permeation emissions?
####### Reference tank.

(c)A reference tank is required to correct for buoyancy effects that may occur during testing. Prepare the reference tank as follows:

(1) Obtain a second tank whose total volume is within 5 percent of the test tank's volume. You may not use a tank that has previously contained fuel or any other contents that might affect its mass stability.

(2) Fill the reference tank with enough glass beads (or other inert material) so the mass of the reference tank is approximately the same as the test tank when filled with fuel. Considering the performance characteristics of your balance, use good engineering judgment to determine how similar the mass of the reference tank needs to be to the mass of the test tank.

(3) Ensure that the inert material is dry.

(4) Seal the tank.
