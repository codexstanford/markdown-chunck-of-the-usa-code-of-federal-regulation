####### Overall efficiency.,2

(v)(A) The overall efficiency of the emission control system shall be determined as the product of the capture system efficiency and the control device efficiency or by the liquid/liquid test protocol as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 (and revised by paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A)() of this section for each solvent recovery system. In those cases in which the overall efficiency is being determined for an entire line, the capture efficiency used to calculate the product of the capture and control efficiency is the total capture efficiency over the entire line.

(B) For coating lines which are both chosen by the owner or operator to comply with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv), (e)(2)(v), or (e)(2)(vi) of this section by the alternative in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section and meet the criteria allowing them to comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section instead of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device, as determined by the test methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii), (iv) and (v)(A) of this section, shall be no less than the equivalent overall efficiency which shall be calculated by the following equation:
