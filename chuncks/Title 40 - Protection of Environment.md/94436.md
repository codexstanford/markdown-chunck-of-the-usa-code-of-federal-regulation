Use the standard wipe test as defined in ยง 761.123 to sample one 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter square (100 cm) area to represent surface area PCB concentrations of each square meter or fraction of a square meter of a nearly flat, non-porous surface. For small surfaces, use the same procedure as for the standard wipe test, only sample the entire area, rather than 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter squares.
