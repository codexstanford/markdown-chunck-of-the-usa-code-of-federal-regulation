####### Storage vessel with the potential for flash emissions

means any storage vessel that contains a hydrocarbon liquid with a stock tank GOR equal to or greater than 0.31 cubic meters per liter and an API gravity equal to or greater than 40 degrees and an actual annual average hydrocarbon liquid throughput equal to or greater than 79,500 liters per day. Flash emissions occur when dissolved hydrocarbons in the fluid evolve from solution when the fluid pressure is reduced.
