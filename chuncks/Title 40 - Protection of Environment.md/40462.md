(2) The total concentration of the pure organic compound constituents having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 &#xB0;C (0.04 pounds per square inch at 68 &#xB0;F) is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight of the total process stream; and

(3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
