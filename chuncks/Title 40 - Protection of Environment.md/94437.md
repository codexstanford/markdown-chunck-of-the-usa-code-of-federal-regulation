For a surface originally contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, it is permissible to composite surface wipe test samples and to use the composite measurement to represent the PCB concentration of the entire surface. Composite samples consist of more than one sample gauze extracted and chemically analyzed together resulting in a single measurement. The composite measurement represents an arithmetic mean of the composited samples.
