(6) The following example illustrates the use of the governing equations to calculateof an SSV flow meter at one reference flow meter value. Note that calculatingfor a CFV flow meter would be similar, except thatwould be determined from Table 2 of this section or calculated iteratively using values ofandas described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
