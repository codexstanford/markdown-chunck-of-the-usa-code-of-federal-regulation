####### Motor gasoline (finished)

means a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons, with or without additives, suitably blended to be used in spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and all types of oxygenated gasoline. Gasoline also has seasonal variations in an effort to control ozone levels. This is achieved by lowering the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline during the summer driving season. Depending on the region of the country the RVP is lowered to below 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi. The RVP may be further lowered by state regulations.
