###### ยง 370.1 What is the purpose of this part?

(a) This part (40 CFR part 370) establishes reporting requirements for providing the public with important information on the hazardous chemicals in their communities. Reporting raises community awareness of chemical hazards and aids in the development of State and local emergency response plans. The reporting requirements established under this part consist of Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheet (SDS) reporting and inventory reporting.

(b) This part is written in a special format to make it easier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, this part establishes enforceable legal requirements. Information considered non-binding guidance under EPCRA is indicated in this regulation by the word "note" and a smaller typeface. Such notes are provided for information purposes only and are not considered legally binding under this part.
