####### APU engine certification data.

(3)If the engine used for the APU has been certified to EPA emission standards you may calculate the APU's emissions based upon existing EPA-certification information about the APU's engine. In this case, calculate the APU's emissions as follows:

(i) For each pollutant determine the brake-specific standard/FEL to which the APU engine was originally EPA-certified.

(ii) Determine the APU engine's cycle-weighted power when operating in the locomotive.

(iii) Multiply each of the APU's applicable brake-specific standards/FELs by the APU engine's cycle-weighted power. The results are the APU's emissions rates (in g/hr).

(iv) Use these emissions rates as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is running. Do not apply a deterioration factor to these values.
