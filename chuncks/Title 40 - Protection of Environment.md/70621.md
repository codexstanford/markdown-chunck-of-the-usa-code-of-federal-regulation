###### Degradation.

5.2.1.2.1.2Assign a degradation factor value to each hazardous substance as follows:

- For any hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed exposure, or if a NAPL is present in the subsurface below an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination at a depth less than or equal to 30 feet, assign that substance a degradation factor value of 1.

- For all other situations, assign a degradation factor value using Table 5-18. Assign the depth to contamination as directed in section 5.2.1.1.2.2, except if evidence indicates that biologically active soil is not present throughout the depth beneath any regularly occupied structure. In this situation, subtract any thickness of non-biologically active soil from the estimated depth to contamination.

The half-life of a substance in the subsurface is defined for HRS purposes as the time required to reduce the initial concentration of the substance in the subsurface by one-half as a result of the combined decay processes of two components: Biodegradation and hydrolysis.

Estimate the half-life (t) of a hazardous substance as follows:

If either of these component half-lives cannot be estimated for the hazardous substance from available data, delete that component half-life from the above equation.

If no half-life information is available for a hazardous substance and the substance is not already assigned a value of 1, unless information indicates otherwise, assign a value of 1.
