(c) Collect and measure emissions as described in 40 CFR part 1066. Calculate emission rates in grams per ton-mile without rounding. Determine values forandfor the vehicle being simulated as specified in 40 CFR part 1066. If you will apply an improvement factor or test results to multiple vehicle configurations, use values of, andthat represent the vehicle configuration with the smallest potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the hybrid capability.
