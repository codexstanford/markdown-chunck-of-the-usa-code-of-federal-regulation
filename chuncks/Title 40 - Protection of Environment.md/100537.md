###### ยง 1037.801 Definitions.
####### Secondary vehicle manufacturer

anyone that produces a vehicle by modifying a complete vehicle or completing the assembly of a partially complete vehicle. For the purpose of this definition, "modifying" generally does not include making changes that do not remove a vehicle from its original certified configuration. However, custom sleeper modifications and alternative fuel conversions that change actual vehicle aerodynamics are considered to be modifications, even if they are permitted without recertification. This definition applies whether the production involves a complete or partially complete vehicle and whether the vehicle was previously certified to emission standards or not. Manufacturers controlled by the manufacturer of the base vehicle (or by an entity that also controls the manufacturer of the base vehicle) are not secondary vehicle manufacturers; rather, both entities are considered to be one manufacturer for purposes of this part.
