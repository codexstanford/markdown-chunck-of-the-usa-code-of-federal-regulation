###### Focusing trap

3.4is a cooled, secondary sorbent trap integrated into the analytical thermal desorber. It typically has a smaller i.d. and lower thermal mass than the original sample tube allowing it to effectively refocus desorbed analytes and then heat rapidly to ensure efficient transfer/injection into the capillary GC analytical column.
