######## Non-HAP binder

means a binder formulation that does not contain any substance that is required to be listed in Section 3 of a safety data sheet (SDS) pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and that is a HAP as defined in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act. In designating a non-HAP binder under this subpart, you may not rely on the SDS for a binder where the manufacturer has withheld the specific chemical identity, including the chemical name, other specific identification of a hazardous chemical, or the exact percentage (concentration) of the substance in a mixture from Section 3 of the SDS. You may not withhold this information when making the case that the binder is a non-HAP binder for the purposes of ยง 63.2996.
