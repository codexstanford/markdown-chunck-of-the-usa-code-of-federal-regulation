() At termination, all surviving fish shall be measured for growth. Total length measurements should be used except in cases where fin erosion occurs, then the use of standard length measurements shall be permitted. Standard length measurements should be made directly with a caliper, but may be measured photographically. Measurements shall be made to the nearest millimeter (0.1 mm is desirable). Weight measurements shall also be made for each fish alive at termination (wet, blotted dry, and to the nearest 0.01 g for the minnows and 0.1 g for the trout). If the fish exposed to the toxicant appear to be edematous compared to control fish, determination of dry, rather than wet, weight is recommended.
