####### Designated liability area.

(c)The system shall be required to prevent all violations of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA. The DLA of any smelter is the area within which the smelter's emissions may cause or significantly contribute to violations of the NAAQS for SOwhen the smelter is operating at its maximum production capacity under any recorded or probable meterological conditions. The boundaries of that area shall be specified in the NSO.

(1) Unless an acceptable demonstration is made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the DLA shall be a circle with a center point at the smelter's tallest stack and a minimum radius as given in the following table:

(2) The NSO may provide for a DLA with different boundaries if the smelter owner can demonstrate through the use of appropriate dispersion modeling and ambient air quality monitoring data that the smelter's controlled emissions could not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of the NAAQS beyond the boundaries of such a different area under any recorded or probable meteorological conditions.

(3) A violation of the NAAQS in the DLA of any smelter shall constitute a violation of that smelter's NSO, unless the issuing agency determines on the basis of a showing by the smelter owner that the smelter owner had taken all emission curtailment action indicated by the SCS operational manual and that the violation was caused in significant part by:

(i) Emissions of another source(s) which were in excess of the maximum permissible emissions applicable to such source(s),

(ii) Fugitive emissions of another source(s), or
