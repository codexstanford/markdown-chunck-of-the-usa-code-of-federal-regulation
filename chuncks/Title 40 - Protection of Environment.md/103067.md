(e)Determine accuracy as described in this paragraph (e). Make multiple measurements of a standard quantity to create a set of observed values,, and compare each observed value to the known value of the standard quantity. The standard quantity may have a single known value, such as a gas standard, or a set of known values of negligible range, such as a known applied pressure produced by a calibration device during repeated applications. The known value of the standard quantity is represented by. If you use a standard quantity with a single value,would be constant. Calculate an accuracy value as follows:
