####### Number of locomotives to be tested.

(a)Determine the number of locomotives to be tested by the following method:

(1) Test a minimum of 2 locomotives per engine family, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. You must test additional locomotives if any locomotives fail to meet any standard. Test 2 more locomotives for each failing locomotive, but stop testing if the total number of locomotives tested equals 10.

(2) If an engine family has been certified using carryover emission data from a family that has been previously tested under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (and we have not ordered or begun to negotiate remedial action of that family), you need to test only one locomotive per engine family. If that locomotive fails to meet applicable standards for any pollutant, testing for that engine family must be conducted as outlined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(3) You may ask us to allow you to test more locomotives than the minimum number described above or you may concede failure before testing 10 locomotives.
