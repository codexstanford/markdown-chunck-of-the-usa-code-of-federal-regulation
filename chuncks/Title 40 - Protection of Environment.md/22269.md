6.1.2.3 Placement of Anemometer at the Center of Manifold. At least one anemometer shall be installed in the immediate vicinity (within 10 m (33 ft)) of the center of the manifold (see section 6.2.1). For its placement in relation to the width of the monitor, there are two alternatives. The first is to make a velocity traverse of the width of the roof monitor where an anemometer is to be placed and install the anemometer at a point of average velocity along this traverse. The traverse may be made with any suitable low velocity measuring device, and shall be made during normal process operating conditions. The second alternative is to install the anemometer half-way across the width of the roof monitor. In this latter case, the velocity traverse need not be conducted.
