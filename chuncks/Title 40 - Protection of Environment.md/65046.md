###### Design Criteria
####### ยง 257.71 Liner design criteria for existing CCR surface impoundments.
######## Mathematical model to estimate the potential for releases.

(C)Owners or operators must incorporate the data collected for paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section into a mathematical model to calculate the potential groundwater concentrations that may result in downgradient wells as a result of the impoundment. Facilities must also, where available, incorporate the national-scale data on constituent concentrations and behavior provided by the existing risk record. Application of the model must account for the full range of site current and potential future conditions at and around the site to ensure that high-end groundwater concentrations have been effectively characterized. All of the data and assumptions incorporated into the model must be documented and justified.
