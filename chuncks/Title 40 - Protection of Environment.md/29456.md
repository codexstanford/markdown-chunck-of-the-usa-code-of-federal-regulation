####### Decoking operation standards for ethylene cracking furnaces.

(7)Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in ยง 63.1102(c), the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section and also use at least two of the control measures specified in paragraphs (e)(7)(ii) through (v) of this section to minimize coke combustion emissions from the decoking of the radiant tube(s) in each ethylene cracking furnace.

(i) During normal operations, conduct daily inspections of the firebox burners and repair all burners that are impinging on the radiant tube(s) as soon as practical, but not later than 1 calendar day after the flame impingement is found. The owner or operator may delay burner repair beyond 1 calendar day using the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(7)(i)(A) and (B) of this section provided the repair cannot be completed during normal operations, the burner cannot be shutdown without significantly impacting the furnace heat distribution and firing rate, and action is taken to reduce flame impingement as much as possible during continued operation. An inspection may include, but is not limited to: visual inspection of the radiant tube(s) for localized bright spots (this may be confirmed with a temperature gun), use of luminescent powders injected into the burner to illuminate the flame pattern, or identifying continued localized coke build-up that causes short runtimes between decoking cycles. A repair may include, but is not limited to: Taking the burner out of service, replacing the burner, adjusting the alignment of the burner, adjusting burner configuration, making burner air corrections, repairing a malfunction of the fuel liquid removal equipment, or adding insulation around the radiant tube(s).

(A) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair, repair must be completed following the next planned decoking operation (and before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations) or during the next ethylene cracking furnace complete shutdown (when the ethylene cracking furnace firebox is taken completely off-line), whichever is earlier.

(B) If a shutdown for repair would cause lower emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair, then shutdown of the ethylene cracking furnace must immediately commence and the repair must be completed before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations.

(ii) During decoking operations, beginning before the expected end of the air-in decoke time, continuously monitor (or use a gas detection tube or equivalent sample technique every three hours to monitor) the COconcentration in the combined decoke effluent downstream of the last component being decoked for an indication that the coke combustion in the ethylene cracking furnace radiant tube(s) is complete. The owner or operator must immediately initiate procedures to stop the coke combustion once the COconcentration at the outlet consistently reaches a level that indicates combustion of coke is complete and site decoke completion assurance procedures have been concluded.
