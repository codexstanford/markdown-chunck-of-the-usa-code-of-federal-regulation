######## Test procedures.

(ii)Prior to the determination of the Kof the test chemical, two procedures shall be followed:

(A) The saturated aqueous solution leaving the generator column shall be tested for the presence of an emulsion, using a Tyndall procedure (i.e. light scattering). If colloids are present, they must be removed prior to injection into the extractor column by lowering the flow rate of water.

(B) The efficiency of removal of the solute (the test chemical) by solvent extraction from the extractor column shall be determined and used in the determination of the Kof the test chemical.
