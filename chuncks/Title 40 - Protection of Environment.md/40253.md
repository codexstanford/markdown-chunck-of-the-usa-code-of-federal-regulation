###### Sampling Line.

6.9Heated 180 &#xB0;C (360 &#xB0;F) and fabricated of either stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane or other material that prevents adsorption of HCl and transports effluent to analytical instrumentation. The extractive sample line must have the capability to transport sample gas to the analytical components as well as direct heated calibration spike gas to the calibration assembly located at the sample probe. It is important to minimize the length of heated sample line.
