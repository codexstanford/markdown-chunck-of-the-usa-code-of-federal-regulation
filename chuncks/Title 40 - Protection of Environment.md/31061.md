####### Breakthrough

means that point in the adsorption step when the mass transfer zone (i.e., the section of the carbon bed where the HAP is removed from the carrier gas stream) first reaches the carbon bed outlet as the mass transfer zone moves down the bed in the direction of flow. The breakthrough point is characterized by the beginning of a sharp increase in the outlet HAP or organic compound concentration.
