###### "Steam electric plants of more than 250 million BTU/hr heat input."

(1)Because the category refers to "plants," we interpret this category title to mean that boiler capacities should be aggregated to determine whether the 250 million BTU/hr threshold is reached. This definition includes only those plants that generate electricity for sale. Plants that cogenerate steam and electricity also fall within the definition of "steam electric plants". Similarly, combined cycle turbines are also considered "steam electric plants" because such facilities incorporate heat recovery steam generators. Simple cycle turbines, in contrast, are not "steam electric plants" because these turbines typically do not generate steam.
