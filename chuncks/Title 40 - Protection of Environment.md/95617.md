(A) Equilibrate one solution containing a known concentration of the test chemical with the sediment or soil in a solid/solution ratio equal to or greater thanand preferably equal to or greater than. It is important that the concentration of the test chemical in the equilibrating solution () does not exceed one-half of its solubility and () should be 10 ppm or less at the end of the equilibration period.

(B) Measure the concentration of the chemical in the solution phase at frequent intervals during the equilibration period.

(C) Determine the equilibration time by plotting the measured concentration versus time of sampling; the equilibration time is the minimum period of time needed to establish a rate of change of solution concentration of 5 percent or less per 24 hours.
