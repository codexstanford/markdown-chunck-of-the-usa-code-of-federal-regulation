###### ยง 1039.610 What provisions apply to vehicles certified under the motor-vehicle program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new nonroad engines or equipment into commerce if the vehicle is already certified to the requirements that apply under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all of the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the engine under this part 1039 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1039. See ยง 1039.605 for similar provisions that apply to motor-vehicle engines produced for nonroad equipment.
