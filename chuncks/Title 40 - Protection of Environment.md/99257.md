####### Evaporative and refueling controls.

(d)For locomotives fueled with a volatile fuel you must design and produce them to minimize evaporative emissions during normal operation, including periods when the engine is shut down. You must also design and produce them to minimize the escape of fuel vapors during refueling. Hoses used to refuel gaseous-fueled locomotives may not be designed to be bled or vented to the atmosphere under normal operating conditions. No valves or pressure relief vents may be used on gaseous-fueled locomotives except as emergency safety devices that do not operate at normal system operating flows and pressures.
