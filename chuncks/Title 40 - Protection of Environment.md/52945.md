(6) ASME MFC-18M-2001 Measurement of Fluid Flow using Variable Area Meters (incorporated by reference,ยง 98.7).

(f) If applicable, the owner or operator shall document the procedures used to ensure the accuracy of gas flow rate, gas composition, temperature, and pressure measurements. These procedures include, but are not limited to, calibration of fuel flow meters and other measurement devices. The estimated accuracy of measurements made with these devices shall also be recorded, and the technical basis for these estimates shall be provided.

(g) Each gas flow meter shall be calibrated prior to the first reporting year and recalibrated either annually or at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer, whichever is more frequent. Each gas flow meter must have a rated accuracy of +/-5 percent or lower and be capable of correcting for the temperature and pressure and, if the gas composition monitor determines CHconcentration on a dry basis, moisture content.
