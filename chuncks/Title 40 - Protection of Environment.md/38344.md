5.1.1Periodic QA testing of each Hg CEMS is required following initial certification. The required QA tests, the test frequencies, and the performance specifications that must be met are summarized in Table A-2, below. All tests must be performed with the affected unit(s) operating (combusting fuel), however, the daily calibration may optionally be performed off-line. The RATA must be performed at normal load, but no particular load level is required for the other tests. For each test, follow the same basic procedures in section 4.1.1 of this appendix that were used for initial certification.
