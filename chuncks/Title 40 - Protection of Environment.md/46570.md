(B)() Manufacturers with aggregated sales from and including 301 through 9,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year certifying light-duty vehicle exhaust emissions from vehicles equipped with proven emission control systems shall use assigned deterioration factors that the manufacturer determines based on its good engineering judgment. However, the manufacturer may not use deterioration factors less than either the average or 70th percentile of all of that manufacturer's deterioration factor data, whichever is less. These minimum deterioration factors shall be calculated according to procedures in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)(), of this section. If the manufacturer does not have at least two data points to calculate these manufacturer specific average deterioration factors, then the deterioration factors shall be no less than the EPA supplied industry-wide deterioration factors. However, the manufacturer may, at its option, accumulate miles on a durability data vehicle and complete emission tests for the purpose of establishing its own deterioration factors.
