(a) If you elect to comply with the alternative equivalent output-based emission limits, instead of the heat input-based limits listed in Table 2 or 15 to this subpart, and you want to take credit for implementing energy conservation measures identified in an energy assessment, you may demonstrate compliance using efficiency credits according to the procedures in this section. You may use this compliance approach for an existing affected boiler for demonstrating initial compliance according to ยง 63.7522(e) and for demonstrating monthly compliance according to ยง 63.7522(f). Owners or operators using this compliance approach must establish an emissions benchmark, calculate and document the efficiency credits, develop an Implementation Plan, comply with the general reporting requirements, and apply the efficiency credit according to the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. You cannot use this compliance approach for a new or reconstructed affected boiler. Additional guidance from the Department of Energy on efficiency credits is available at.
