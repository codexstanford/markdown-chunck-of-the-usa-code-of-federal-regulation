######### Procedure.
########## Equipment setup and data collection.

(2)(i) Zero and span the total NOgas analyzer(s) as you would before emission testing.

(ii) Select an NOcalibration gas, balance gas of dry air, that has an NOconcentration within +/-5% of the maximum NOconcentration expected during testing.

(iii) Overflow this calibration gas at the gas sampling system's probe or overflow fitting. Allow for stabilization of the total NOresponse, accounting only for transport delays and instrument response.
