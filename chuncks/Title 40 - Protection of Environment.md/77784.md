######## General alternate fuel economy and CO,emissions label values for electric vehicles.

(4)Determine FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy label values for electric vehicles as described in ยง 600.116. Convert W-hour/mile results to miles per kW-hr and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent. COlabel information is based on tailpipe emissions only, so COemissions from electric vehicles are assumed to be zero.
