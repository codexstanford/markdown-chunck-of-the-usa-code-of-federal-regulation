###### Introduction
####### § 60.1540 Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that supersede the requirements specified in subpart B?
######## Increments of progress requirements.

(b)For Class II units (see definition in § 60.1940), a State plan must include at least two increments of progress for the affected municipal waste combustion units. The two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(1) and (5). That requirement applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1) that would require a State plan to include all five increments of progress for all municipal waste combustion units. For Class I units under this subpart, the final control plan must contain the five increments of progress in § 60.24(e)(1).
