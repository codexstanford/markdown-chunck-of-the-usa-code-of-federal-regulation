####### VOHAP concentration.

(1)The treatment process shall reduce the VOHAP concentration of the off-site material using a means, other than by dilution, to achieve one of the following performance levels, as applicable:

(i) In the case when every off-site material stream entering the treatment process has an average VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 500 ppmw at the point-of-delivery, then the VOHAP concentration of the off-site material shall be reduced to a level that is less than 500 ppmw at the point-of-treatment.

(ii) In the case when off-site material streams entering the treatment process are a mixture of off-site material streams having an average VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 500 ppmw at the point-of-delivery with off-site material streams having average VOHAP concentrations less than 500 ppmw at the point-of-delivery, then the VOHAP concentration of the off-site material must be reduced to a level at the point-of-treatment that meets the performance level specified in either paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.

(A) Less than the VOHAP concentration limit (C) established for the treatment process using the procedure specified in ยง 63.694(d); or

(B) Less than the lowest VOHAP concentration determined for each of the off-site material streams entering the treatment process as determined by the VOHAP concentration of the off-site material at the point-of-delivery.
