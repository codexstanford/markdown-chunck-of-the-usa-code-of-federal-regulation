###### 1.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO). How good must my collected data be?

Method 7E is designed to provide high-quality data for determining compliance with Federal and State emission standards and for relative accuracy testing of CEMS. In these and other applications, the principal objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emission levels encountered. To meet this objective, the use of EPA traceability protocol calibration gases and measurement system performance tests are required.
