(1) For known vehicle configurations, use at least three equally spaced axle ratios or tire sizes and three different road loads (nine configurations), or at least four equally spaced axle ratios or tire sizes and two different road loads (eight configurations). Select axle ratios to represent the full range of expected vehicle installations. Select axle ratios and tire sizes such that the ratio of engine speed to vehicle speed covers the range of ratios of minimum and maximum engine speed to vehicle speed when the transmission is in top gear for the vehicles in which the powertrain will be installed. Note that you do not have to use the same axle ratios and tire sizes for each GEM regulatory subcategory. You may determine appropriateand mass values to cover the range of intended vehicle applications or you may use theand mass values specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

(2) If vehicle configurations are not known, determine the vehicle model inputs for a set of vehicle configurations as described in 40 CFR 1036.540(c)(3) with the following exceptions:
