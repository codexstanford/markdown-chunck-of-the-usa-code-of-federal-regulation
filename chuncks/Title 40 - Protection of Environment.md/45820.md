####### For aftermarket parts that accelerate deterioration of existing emission related parts during normal operation.

(3)(i) The aftermarket test part can be installed on the durability test vehicle and aged for 50,000 miles using the vehicle durability driving schedules contained in part 86, appendix IV. As an alternative, the aftermarket part manufacturer may use a different durability procedure if it can demonstrate to the MOD Director that the alternative procedure results in an improved technical evaluation of the part's influence on vehicle or engine emissions for the part's useful life mileage interval, or results in a significant cost savings to the aftermarket part manufacturer with no loss in technical validity compared to the recommended durability schedules in part 86, appendix IV. The aftermarket part manufacturer shall receive the written approval from the MOD Director prior to implementation of the alternative procedures.

(ii) Where the comparable original equipment part has a recommended replacement interval of less than 50,000 miles, the test part shall be replaced no sooner than its useful life mileage interval during the required 50,000 mile durability demonstration.
