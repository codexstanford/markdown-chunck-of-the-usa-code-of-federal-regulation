####### Measurement procedure.

(c)(1) The combined weight of the test rider and test equipment used on the motorcycle must not be more than 80 kg (176 lb) nor less than 75 kg (165 lb). Weights shall be placed on the motorcycle saddle behind the rider to compensate for any difference between the actual driver/equipment load and the required 75 kg (165 lb) minimum.

(2) The motorcycle must approach the microphone target point with the throttle fully open and in the highest gear. The motorcycle must start such that maximum speed is reached before the vehicle is within 7.5 m of the microphone target point. The motorcycle must continue along the vehicle path with fully open throttle and at maximum speed past the end point, at which time the throttle must be closed.

(3) If the motorcycle is equipped with an automatic transmission, the procedure of paragraph (1), above, must be followed except that the highest selectable range shall be employed.
