######## Unit with multiple stacks or ducts.

(c)When the flue gases from an affected unit discharge to the atmosphere through two or more stacks or when flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than the stack, the owner or operator shall monitor the NOemission rate in a way that is representative of each affected unit. Where another unit also exhausts flue gases to one or more of the stacks where monitoring systems are installed, the owner or operator shall also comply with the applicable common stack monitoring requirements of this section. The owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each stack or duct and determine the NOemission rate for the unit as the Btu-weighted average of the NOemission rates measured in the stacks or ducts using the heat input estimation procedures in appendix F to this part. Alternatively, for units that are eligible to use the procedures of appendix D to this part, the owner or operator may monitor heat input and NOemission rate at the unit level, in lieu of installing flow monitors on each stack or duct. If this alternative unit-level monitoring is performed, report, for each unit operating hour, the highest emission rate measured by any of the NO-diluent monitoring systems installed on the individual stacks or ducts as the hourly NOemission rate for the unit, and report the hourly unit heat input as determined under appendix D to this part. Also, when this alternative unit-level monitoring is performed, the applicable NOmissing data procedures in §§ 75.31 or 75.33 shall be used for each unit operating hour in which a quality-assured NOemission rate is not obtained for one or more of the individual stacks or ducts; or
