(dd) New Hampshire may revise its SIP to implements control measures on EGUs and non-EGUs through an emissions trading program adopted in regulations that differ substantively from subparts AAAA through IIII of part 96 of this chapter as set forth in this paragraph.

(1) New Hampshire must expand the applicability provisions in § 96.304 of this chapter to include all non-EGUs subject to New Hampshire's emissions trading program at New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, chapter Env-A 3200 (2004).

(2) New Hampshire may decline to adopt the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in provisions of:

(i) Subpart IIII of this part and the provisions applicable only to CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in units in subparts AAAA through HHHH of this part;

(ii) Section 96.388(b) of this chapter and the provisions of subpart IIII of this part applicable only to CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in units under § 96.388(b); or

(iii) Section 96.388(c) of this chapter and the provisions of subpart IIII of this part applicable only to CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in units under § 96.388(c).

(3) New Hampshire may adopt the allocation provisions set forth in subpart EEEE of part 96 of this chapter, provided that New Hampshire must provide for issuance of an amount of CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances for an ozone season not exceeding 3,000 tons for 2009 and thereafter;

(4) New Hampshire may adopt any methodology for allocating CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to individual sources, as follows:

(i) New Hampshire's methodology must not allow New Hampshire to allocate CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances for an ozone season in excess of 3,000 tons for 2009 and thereafter;

(ii) New Hampshire's methodology must require that, for EGUs commencing operation before January 1, 2001, New Hampshire will determine, and notify the Administrator of, each unit's allocation of CAIR NOallowances by October 31, 2006 for the ozone seasons 2009, 2010, and 2011 and by October 31, 2008 and October 31 of each year thereafter for the ozone season in the 4th year after the year of the notification deadline; and

(iii) New Hampshire's methodology must require that, for EGUs commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001, New Hampshire will determine, and notify the Administrator of, each unit's allocation of CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances by July 31 of the calendar year of the ozone season for which the CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances are allocated.

(ee) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a State may adopt, and include in a SIP revision submitted by March 31, 2007, regulations relating to the Federal CAIR NOOzone Season Trading Program under subparts AAAA through HHHH of part 97 of this chapter as follows:

(1) The State may adopt, as applicability provisions replacing the provisions in § 97.304 of this chapter, provisions for applicability that are substantively identical to the provisions in § 96.304 of this chapter expanded to include all non-EGUs subject to the State's emissions trading program approved under § 51.121(p). Before January 1, 2009, a State's applicability provisions shall be considered to be substantively identical to § 96.304 of this chapter (with the expansion allowed under this paragraph) regardless of whether the State's regulations include the definition of "Biomass", paragraph (3) of the definition of "Cogeneration unit", and the second sentence of the definition of "Total energy input" in § 97.102 of this chapter promulgated on October 19, 2007, provided that the State timely submits to the Administrator a SIP revision that revises the State's regulations to include such provisions. Submission to the Administrator of a SIP revision that revises the State's regulations to include such provisions shall be considered timely if the submission is made by January 1, 2009.

(2) The State may adopt, as CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation provisions replacing the provisions in subpart EEEE of part 97 of this chapter:

(i) Allocation provisions substantively identical to subpart EEEE of part 96 of this chapter, under which the permitting authority makes the allocations; or

(ii) Any methodology for allocating CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to individual sources under which the permitting authority makes the allocations, provided that:

(A) The State may provide for issuance of an amount of CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances for an ozone season, in addition to the amount in the State's Ozone Season EGU NOBudget for such ozone season, not exceeding the portion of the State's trading program budget, under the State's emissions trading program approved under § 51.121(p), attributed to the non-EGUs that the applicability provisions in § 96.304 of this chapter are expanded to include under paragraph (ee)(1) of this section.

(B) The State's methodology must not allow the State to allocate CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances for an ozone season in excess of the amount in the State's Ozone Season EGU NOBudget for such ozone season plus any additional amount of CAIR Ozone Season NOallowances issued under paragraph (ee)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for such ozone season.

(C) The State's methodology must require that, for EGUs commencing operation before January 1, 2001, the permitting authority will determine, and notify the Administrator of, each unit's allocation of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances by April 30, 2007 for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and by October 31, 2008 and October 31 of each year thereafter for the 4th year after the year of the notification deadline.

(D) The State's methodology must require that, for EGUs commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001, the permitting authority will determine, and notify the Administrator of, each unit's allocation of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances by July 31 of the year for which the CAIR NOOzone Season allowances are allocated.

(3) The State may adopt CAIR opt-in unit provisions as follows:

(i) Provisions for CAIR opt-in units, including provisions for applications for CAIR opt-in permits, approval of CAIR opt-in permits, treatment of units as CAIR opt-in units, and allocation and recordation of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances for CAIR opt-in units, that are substantively identical to subpart IIII of part 96 of this chapter and the provisions of subparts AAAA through HHHH that are applicable to CAIR opt-in units or units for which a CAIR opt-in permit application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is not yet issued or denied;

(ii) Provisions for CAIR opt-in units, including provisions for applications for CAIR opt-in permits, approval of CAIR opt-in permits, treatment of units as CAIR opt-in units, and allocation and recordation of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances for CAIR opt-in units, that are substantively identical to subpart IIII of part 96 of this chapter and the provisions of subparts AAAA through HHHH that are applicable to CAIR opt-in units or units for which a CAIR opt-in permit application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR opt-in permit is not yet issued or denied, except that the provisions exclude § 96.388(b) of this chapter and the provisions of subpart IIII of part 96 of this chapter that apply only to units covered by § 96.388(b) of this chapter; or
