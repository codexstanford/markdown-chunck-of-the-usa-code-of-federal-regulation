######## Totally enclosed and unvented dry abrasive blasting chamber

means a dry abrasive blasting enclosure which has no vents to the atmosphere, thus no emissions. A typical example of this sort of abrasive blasting enclosure is a small "glove box" enclosure, where the worker places their hands in openings or gloves that extend into the box and enable the worker to hold the objects as they are being blasted without allowing air and blast material to escape the box.
