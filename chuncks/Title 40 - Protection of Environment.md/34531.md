######## Carbon adsorbers.,e.g.,

(d)If you are using a carbon adsorber as an add-on control device, you must monitor the total regeneration desorbing gas (steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and cooling cycle, and comply with paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) and (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The regeneration desorbing gas mass flow monitor must be an integrating device having an accuracy of +/-10 percent capable of recording the total regeneration desorbing gas mass flow for each regeneration cycle.

(2) The carbon bed temperature monitor must have a minimum accuracy of +/-1.2 degrees Celsius or +/-1 percent of the temperature value in degrees Celsius, whichever is larger, and must be capable of recording the temperature within 15 minutes of completing any carbon bed cooling cycle.
