###### ยง 63.10 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
####### Request to reduce frequency of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports.

(ii)Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator who is required by a relevant standard to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:

(A) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods) the affected source's excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the source is in compliance with the relevant standard;

(B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the relevant standard; and

(C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of reporting for the affected source, as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.

(iii) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports required to comply with a relevant standard may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.

(iv) As soon as CMS data indicate that the source is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified in the relevant standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the frequency specified in the relevant standard, and the owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) report for the noncomplying emission points at the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant standard for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard, as provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
