####### Confirmation of conferral.

(5)If the conferrer has sufficient application-specific allowances for the conferral, the conferral will occur and the relevant Agency official will issue a confirmation notice to both the conferrer and conferee documenting the conferral occurred. The relevant agency official will reduce the conferrer's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity conferred. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the conferrer did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conferral or that the regulated substances produced or imported with conferred allowances are used for anything other than the specific application identified in the conferee's submittal and for the application those allowances were allocated for, the conferrer and conferee will be liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conferral.
