###### Apparatus.

4.3A complete UV calibration system consists of an Ogenerator, an output port or manifold, a photometer, an appropriate source of zero air, and other components as necessary. The configuration must provide a stable Oconcentration at the system output and allow the photometer to accurately assay the output concentration to the precision specified for the photometer (4.3.1). Figure 2 shows a commonly used configuration and serves to illustrate the calibration procedure, which follows. Other configurations may require appropriate variations in the procedural steps. All connections between components in the calibration system downstream of the Ogenerator must be of glass, Teflon, or other relatively inert materials. Additional information regarding the assembly of a UV photometric calibration apparatus is given in Reference 13. For certification of transfer standards which provide their own source of Othe transfer standard may replace the Ogenerator and possibly other components shown in Figure 2; see Reference 12 for guidance.
