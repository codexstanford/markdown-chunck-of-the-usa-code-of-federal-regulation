######## Oil consumption tracking.

(2)Generate a target oil consumption line for both the bulk and volatile pathway which describes the relationship between oil exposure and aging hours on the cycle. For the engine-based stand the control limits are +/-10% for total oil consumption, noting that the volatile pathway must not exceed 30% of the total. For the burner-based stand, the controls limits are +/-5% for both pathways, which are tracked separately.
