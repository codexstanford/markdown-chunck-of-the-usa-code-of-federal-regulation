###### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N).

10.1The RMSD in the noise must be less than one tenth of the minimum analyte peak absorbance in each analytical region. For example if the minimum peak absorbance is 0.01 at the required DL, then RMSD measured over the entire analytical region must be &#x2264;0.001.
