######## Periods of startup and shutdown

(f). For a new or existing affected source, or a new or existing emission unit subject to an emissions limit in paragraphs § 63.1505(b) through (j) expressed in units of pounds per ton of feed/charge, or µg TEQ or ng TEQ per Mg of feed/charge, demonstrate compliance during periods of startup and shutdown in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section or determine your emissions per unit of feed/charge during periods of startup and shutdown in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Startup and shutdown emissions for group 1 furnaces and in-line fluxers must be calculated individually, and not on the basis of a SAPU. Periods of startup and shutdown are excluded from the calculation of SAPU emission limits in § 63.1505(k), the SAPU monitoring requirements in § 63.1510(t) and the SAPU emissions calculations in § 63.1513(e).

(1) For periods of startup and shutdown, records establishing a feed/charge rate of zero, a flux rate of zero, and that the affected source or emission unit was either heated with electricity, propane or natural gas as the sole sources of heat or was not heated, may be used to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit, or

(2) For periods of startup and shutdown, divide your measured emissions in lb/hr or µg/hr or ng/hr by the feed/charge rate in tons/hr or Mg/hr from your most recent performance test associated with a production rate greater than zero, or the rated capacity of the affected source if no prior performance test data are available.
