####### Flame ionization detector check.

(4)Upon initial operation, and after maintenance to the detector, each Flame Ionization Detector (FID) shall be checked, and adjusted if necessary, for proper peaking and characterization. Procedures described in SAE Paper No. 770141 are recommended for this purpose. A copy of this paper may be obtained from the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. (SAE), 400 Commonwealth Drive, Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 15096-0001. Additionally, every month the response of each FID to a methane concentration of approximately 50 ppm CHshall be checked. If the response is outside of the range of 1.10 to 1.20, corrective action shall be taken to bring the FID response within this range. The response shall be computed by the following formula:
