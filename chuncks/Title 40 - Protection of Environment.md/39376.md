(3)For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, "Title V."

(i) If the permitting authority has established dates for submitting annual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), "Title V," you may prepare or submit, if required, the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the date specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.

(ii) If an affected source prepares or submits an annual certification and compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), "Title V," and the compliance report includes all required information concerning exceedences of any limitation in this subpart, its submission will be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same exceedences in the annual monitoring report. However, submission of an annual certification and compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.
