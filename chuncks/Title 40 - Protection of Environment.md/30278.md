######## Emission rates are capped.

(7)The hydrogen chloride and chlorine emission rates you use to calculate the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns must not result in total chlorine emission concentrations exceeding:

(i) For incinerators that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 77 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(ii) For incinerators that are new or reconstructed sources after April 19, 1996: 21 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(iii) For cement kilns that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 130 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(iv) For cement kilns that are new or reconstructed sources after April 19, 1996: 86 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(v) For lightweight aggregate kilns that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 600 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(vi) For lightweight aggregate kilns that are new or reconstructed sources after April 19, 1996: 600 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
