######## Shutdown

means the period in which cessation of operation of a boiler or process heater is initiated for any purpose. Shutdown begins when the boiler or process heater no longer supplies useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity or when no fuel is being fed to the boiler or process heater, whichever is earlier. Shutdown ends when the boiler or process heater no longer supplies useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity, and no fuel is being combusted in the boiler or process heater.
