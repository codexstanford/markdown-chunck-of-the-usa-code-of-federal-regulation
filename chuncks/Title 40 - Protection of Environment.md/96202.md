####### Definitions.

(b)(1) Skin sensitization (allergic contact dermatitis) is an immunologically mediated cutaneous reaction to a substance. In the human, the responses may be characterized by pruritis, erythema, edema, papules, vesicles, bullae, or a combination of these. In other species the reactions may differ and only erythema and edema may be seen.

(2) Induction period is a period of at least 1 week following a sensitization exposure during which a hypersensitive state is developed.

(3) Induction exposure is an experimental exposure of a subject to a test substance with the intention of inducing a hypersensitive state.

(4) Challenge exposure is an experimental exposure of a previously treated subject to a test substance following an induction period, to determine whether the subject will react in a hypersensitive manner.
