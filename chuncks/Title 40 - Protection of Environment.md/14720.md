####### Determination of Attainment.

(i)EPA has determined, as of October 25, 2013, based on quality-assured ambient air quality data for 2009 to 2011 and 2010 to 2012 ambient air quality data, that the Liberty-Clairton, PA nonattainment area has attained the 1997 annual fine particle (PM) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PMNAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 1997 annual PMNAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
