(c)(1) A party, if he files exceptions and a brief, shall state in writing whether he desires to make an oral argument thereon before the Environmental Appeals Board; otherwise, he shall be deemed to have waived such oral argument. The Environmental Appeals Board shall, however, on its own initiative, have the right to set an appeal for oral argument.
