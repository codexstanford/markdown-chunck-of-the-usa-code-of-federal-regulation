() Clear and compelling evidence, including information and supporting data, demonstrating thatordoes not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. Evidence must include data collected from similar environments (soils, temperatures, precipitation, USDA Hardiness Zones) as the proposed feedstock production project site and accepted by the scientific community. Such a demonstration should include consideration of the elements of a Risk Mitigation Plan set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(x)(A) of this section, fully disclose the potential invasiveness of the feedstock, provide a closure plan for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production, and explain why a Risk Mitigation Plan is not needed to make the required determination.
