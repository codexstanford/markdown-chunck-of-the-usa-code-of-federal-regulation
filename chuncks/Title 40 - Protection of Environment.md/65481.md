###### § 258.51 Ground-water monitoring systems.

(a) A ground-water monitoring system must be installed that consists of a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations and depths, to yield ground-water samples from the uppermost aquifer (as defined in § 258.2) that:

(1) Represent the quality of background ground water that has not been affected by leakage from a unit. A determination of background quality may include sampling of wells that are not hydraulically upgradient of the waste management area where:

(i) Hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator to determine what wells are hydraulically upgradient; or

(ii) Sampling at other wells will provide an indication of background ground-water quality that is as representative or more representative than that provided by the upgradient wells; and

(2) Represent the quality of ground water passing the relevant point of compliance specified by Director of an approved State under § 258.40(d) or at the waste management unit boundary in unapproved States. The downgradient monitoring system must be installed at the relevant point of compliance specified by the Director of an approved State under § 258.40(d) or at the waste management unit boundary in unapproved States that ensures detection of ground-water contamination in the uppermost aquifer. When physical obstacles preclude installation of ground-water monitoring wells at the relevant point of compliance at existing units, the down-gradient monitoring system may be installed at the closest practicable distance hydraulically down-gradient from the relevant point of compliance specified by the Director of an approved State under § 258.40 that ensure detection of groundwater contamination in the uppermost aquifer.

(b) The Director of an approved State may approve a multiunit ground-water monitoring system instead of separate ground-water monitoring systems for each MSWLF unit when the facility has several units, provided the multi-unit ground-water monitoring system meets the requirement of § 258.51(a) and will be as protective of human health and the environment as individual monitoring systems for each MSWLF unit, based on the following factors:

(1) Number, spacing, and orientation of the MSWLF units;

(2) Hydrogeologic setting;

(3) Site history;

(4) Engineering design of the MSWLF units, and

(5) Type of waste accepted at the MSWLF units.
