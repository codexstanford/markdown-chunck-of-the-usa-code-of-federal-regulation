2.4.8.3 Generate several additional concentrations (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested to verify linearity) by decreasing For increasing. For each concentration generated, calculate the exact NO and NOconcentrations using equations (16) and (18) respectively. Record the analyzer's NO and NOresponses for each concentration. Plot the analyzer responses versus the respective calculated NO and NOconcentrations and draw or calculate the NO and NOcalibration curves. For subsequent calibrations where linearity can be assumed, these curves may be checked with a two-point calibration consisting of a zero point and NO and NOconcentrations of approximately 80 percent of the URL.
