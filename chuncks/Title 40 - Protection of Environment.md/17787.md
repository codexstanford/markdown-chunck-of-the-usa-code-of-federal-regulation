###### § 60.47c Emission monitoring for particulate matter.
####### i.e.,i.e.,,i.e.,

(i) The owner or operator shall conduct 10 minute observations (during normal operation) each operating day the affected facility fires fuel for which an opacity standard is applicable using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part and demonstrate that the sum of the occurrences of any visible emissions is not in excess of 5 percent of the observation period (, 30 seconds per 10 minute period). If the sum of the occurrence of any visible emissions is greater than 30 seconds during the initial 10 minute observation, immediately conduct a 30 minute observation. If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.45c(a)(8).

(ii) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.

(3) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations shall be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see OAQPS "Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems." This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission Measurement Center Preliminary Methods.

(b) All COMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable procedures under Performance Specification 1 of appendix B of this part. The span value of the opacity COMS shall be between 60 and 80 percent.

(c) Owners and operators of an affected facilities that burn only distillate oil that contains no more than 0.5 weight percent sulfur and/or liquid or gaseous fuels with potential sulfur dioxide emission rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) heat input or less and that do not use a post-combustion technology to reduce SO2 or PM emissions and that are subject to an opacity standard in § 60.43c(c) are not required to operate a COMS if they follow the applicable procedures in § 60.48c(f).

(d) Owners or operators complying with the PM emission limit by using a PM CEMS must calibrate, maintain, operate, and record the output of the system for PM emissions discharged to the atmosphere as specified in § 60.45c(c). The CEMS specified in paragraph § 60.45c(c) shall be operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the affected facility except for CEMS breakdowns and repairs. Data is recorded during calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.

(e) Owners and operators of an affected facility that is subject to an opacity standard in § 60.43c(c) and that does not use post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM, SO, or carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, burns only gaseous fuels or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.5 weight percent sulfur, and is operated such that emissions of CO discharged to the atmosphere from the affected facility are maintained at levels less than or equal to 0.15 lb/MMBtu on a boiler operating day average basis is not required to operate a COMS. Owners and operators of affected facilities electing to comply with this paragraph must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section; or

(1) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(i) The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and operated according to the provisions in § 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb of this part.

(ii) Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).

(iii) At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis. The 1-hour averages are calculated using the data points required in § 60.13(h)(2).

(iv) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests for the CO CEMS must be performed in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.

(2) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for each steam generating unit operating day by multiplying the average hourly CO output concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the corresponding average hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the corresponding average hourly heat input to the affected source. The 24-hour average CO emission level is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of the hourly CO emission levels computed for each steam generating unit operating day.

(3) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission level each steam generating unit operating day excluding periods of affected source startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour average CO emission level is greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high emission incident and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour average CO emission level to 0.15 lb/MMBtu or less.

(4) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed according to paragraph (e) of this section and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the 24-hour average CO emission level was greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.

(f) An owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject to an opacity standard in § 60.43c(c) is not required to operate a COMS provided that the affected facility meets the conditions in either paragraphs (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

(1) The affected facility uses a fabric filter (baghouse) as the primary PM control device and, the owner or operator operates a bag leak detection system to monitor the performance of the fabric filter according to the requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part.

(2) The affected facility uses an ESP as the primary PM control device, and the owner or operator uses an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part.

(3) The affected facility burns only gaseous fuels and/or fuel oils that contain no greater than 0.5 weight percent sulfur, and the owner or operator operates the unit according to a written site-specific monitoring plan approved by the permitting authority. This monitoring plan must include procedures and criteria for establishing and monitoring specific parameters for the affected facility indicative of compliance with the opacity standard. For testing performed as part of this site-specific monitoring plan, the permitting authority may require as an alternative to the notification and reporting requirements specified in §§ 60.8 and 60.11 that the owner or operator submit any deviations with the excess emissions report required under § 60.48c(c).
