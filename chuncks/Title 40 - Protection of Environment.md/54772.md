#### PART 127 - NPDES ELECTRONIC REPORTING
##### Appendix A to Part 127 - Minimum Set of NPDES Data

The following two tables identify the minimum set of NPDES data that authorized states, tribes, territories must enter or transfer to EPA's national NPDES data system as well as what NPDES-regulated entities must electronically report to the designated initial recipient (authorized NPDES program or EPA) [see 40 CFR 127.2(b)]. Authorized NPDES programs will be the data provider in the event the regulated entity is covered by a waiver from electronic reporting. Use of these two tables ensures that there is consistent and complete reporting nationwide, and expeditious collection and processing of the data, thereby making it more accurate and timely. Taken together, these data standardizations and the corresponding electronic reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 3, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 403, and 503 are designed to save the NPDES authorized programs considerable resources, make reporting easier for NPDES-regulated entities, streamline permit renewals (as permit writers typically review previous noncompliance events during permit renewal), ensure full exchange of NPDES program data between states and EPA to the public, improve environmental decision-making, and protect human health and the environment.

Authorized NPDES programs may also require NPDES regulated entities to submit more data than what is listed in this appendix. The authorized NPDES program can require NPDES regulated entities to submit these "non-appendix A" data on paper, electronically, or attachments to electronic notices and reports filed in compliance with this part.
