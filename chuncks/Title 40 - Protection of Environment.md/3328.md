######## Potential to emit

means the maximum capacity of a source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is enforceable as a practical matter. Secondary emissions, as defined at ยง 52.21(b)(18) of this chapter, do not count in determining the potential to emit of a source.
