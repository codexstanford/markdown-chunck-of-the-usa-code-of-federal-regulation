####### Dermal washing study.

(ii)(A) A washing experiment must be conducted to assess the removal of the applied dose of the test substance by washing the treated skin area with a mild soap and water. A single dose must be applied to two animals in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section. After application (2 to 5 minutes) the treated areas of the animals must be washed with a mild soap and water. The amounts of test substance recovered in the washes must be determined to assess the effectiveness of removal by washing.

(B) Unless precluded by corrosiveness, the test substance must be applied and kept on the skin for a minimum of 6 hours. At the time of removal of the covering, the treated area must be washed following the procedure as outlined in the dermal washing study. Both the covering and the washes must be analyzed for residual test substance. At the termination of the studies, each animal must be sacrificed and the treated skin removed. An appropriate section of treated skin must be analyzed to determine residual radioactivity.
