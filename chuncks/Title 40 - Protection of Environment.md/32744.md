###### Monitoring and Compliance Requirements
####### § 63.1510 Monitoring requirements.
######## Capture/collection system.

(d)The owner or operator must:

(1) Install, operate, and maintain a capture/collection system for each affected source and emission unit equipped with an add-on air pollution control device; and

(2) Inspect each capture/collection and closed vent system at least once each calendar year to ensure that each system is operating in accordance with the operating requirements in § 63.1506(c) and record the results of each inspection. This inspection shall include a volumetric flow rate measurement taken at a location in the ductwork downstream of the hoods that is representative of the actual volumetric flow rate without interference due to leaks, ambient air added for cooling or ducts from other hoods. The flow rate measurement must be performed in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. As an alternative to the flow rate measurement specified in this paragraph, the inspection may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, including the operating requirements in § 63.1506(c), by including permanent total enclosure verification in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (iv) of this section. Inspections that fail to successfully demonstrate that the requirements of § 63.1506(c) are met, must be followed by repair or adjustment to the system operating conditions and a follow up inspection within 45 days to demonstrate that § 63.1506(c) requirements are fully met.

(i) Conduct annual flow rate measurements using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or conduct annual verification of a permanent total enclosure using EPA Method 204; or you may follow one of the three alternate procedures described in paragraphs (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section to maintain system operations in accordance with an operating limit established during the performance test. The operating limit is determined as the average reading of a parametric monitoring instrument (Magnehelic&#xAE;, manometer, anemometer, or other parametric monitoring instrument) and technique as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. A deviation, as defined in paragraphs (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, from the parametric monitoring operating limit requires the owner or operator to make repairs or adjustments to restore normal operation within 45 days.

(ii) As an alternative to annual flow rate measurements using EPA Methods 1 and 2, measurement with EPA Methods 1 and 2 can be performed once every 5 years, provided that:

(A) A flow rate indicator consisting of a pitot tube and differential pressure gauge (Magnehelic&#xAE;, manometer or other differential pressure gauge) is installed with the pitot tube tip located at a representative point of the duct proximate to the location of the Methods 1 and 2 measurement site; and

(B) The flow rate indicator is installed and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications; and

(C) The differential pressure is recorded during the Method 2 performance test series; and

(D) Daily differential pressure readings are made by taking three measurements with at least 5 minutes between each measurement and averaging the three measurements; and readings are recorded daily and maintained at or above 90 percent of the average pressure differential indicated by the flow rate indicator during the most recent Method 2 performance test series; and

(E) An inspection of the pitot tube and associated lines for damage, plugging, leakage and operational integrity is conducted at least once per year; or

(iii) As an alternative to annual flow rate measurements using EPA Methods 1 and 2, measurement with EPA Methods 1 and 2 can be performed once every 5 years, provided that:

(A) Daily measurements of the capture and collection system's fan revolutions per minute (RPM) or fan motor amperage (amps) are made by taking three measurements with at least 5 minutes between each measurement, and averaging the three measurements; and readings are recorded daily and maintained at or above 90 percent of the average RPM or amps measured during the most recent Method 2 performance test series; or

(B) A static pressure measurement device is installed in the duct immediately downstream of the hood exit, and daily pressure readings are made by taking three measurements with at least 5 minutes between each measurement, and averaging the three measurements; and readings are recorded daily and maintained at 90 percent or better of the average vacuum recorded during the most recent Method 2 performance test series; or

(C) A hotwire anemometer, ultrasonic flow meter, cross-duct pressure differential sensor, venturi pressure differential monitoring or orifice plate equipped with an associated thermocouple and automated data logging software and associated hardware is installed; and daily readings are made by taking three measurements with at least 5 minutes between each measurement, and averaging the three measurements; and readings are recorded daily and maintained at 90 percent or greater of the average readings during the most recent Method 2 performance test series; or

(D) For booth-type hoods, hotwire anemometer measurements of hood face velocity are performed simultaneously with EPA Method 1 and 2 measurements, and the annual hood face velocity measurements confirm that the enclosure draft is maintained at 90 percent or greater of the average readings during the most recent Method 2 performance test series. Daily readings are made by taking three measurements with at least 5 minutes between each measurement, and averaging the three measurements; and readings are recorded daily and maintained at 90 percent or greater of the average readings during the most recent Method 1 and 2 performance test series.

(iv) As an alternative to the annual verification of a permanent total enclosure using EPA Method 204, verification can be performed once every 5 years, provided that:

(A) Negative pressure in the enclosure is directly monitored by a pressure indicator installed at a representative location;

(B) Pressure readings are recorded daily or the system is interlocked to halt material feed should the system not operate under negative pressure;

(C) An inspection of the pressure indicator for damage and operational integrity is conducted at least once per calendar year.

(3) For sweat furnaces, in lieu of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of a sweat furnace may inspect each sweat furnace at least once each calendar year to ensure that they are being operated in accordance with the negative air flow requirements in § 63.1506(c)(4). The owner or operator of a sweat furnace must demonstrate negative air flow into the sweat furnace in accordance with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Perform an annual visual smoke test to demonstrate airflow into the sweat furnace or towards the plane of the sweat furnace opening;

(ii) Perform the smoke test using a smoke source, such as a smoke tube, smoke stick, smoke cartridge, smoke candle or other smoke source that produces a persistent and neutral buoyancy aerosol; and

(iii) Perform the visual smoke test at a safe distance from and near the center of the sweat furnace opening.
