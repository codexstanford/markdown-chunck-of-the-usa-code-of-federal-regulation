####### Redundant measurements.

(b)For all PEMS described in this subpart, you may use data from multiple instruments to calculate test results for a single test. If you use redundant systems, use good engineering judgment to use multiple measured values in calculations or to disregard individual measurements. Note that you must keep your results from all measurements, as described in ยง 1065.25. This requirement applies whether or not you actually use the measurements in your calculations.
