### Subchapter U - Air Pollution Controls
#### PART 1054 - CONTROL OF EMISSIONS FROM NEW, SMALL NONROAD SPARK-IGNITION ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT
##### Subpart B - Emission Standards and Related Requirements
###### § 1054.101 What emission standards and requirements must my engines meet?
####### Evaporative emissions.

(b)Except as specified in § 1054.20, new equipment using engines that run on a volatile liquid fuel (such as gasoline) must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1060. The requirements of 40 CFR part 1060 that apply are considered also to be requirements of this part 1054. Marine vessels using auxiliary marine engines subject to this part must meet the evaporative emission requirements in 40 CFR 1045.112 instead of the evaporative emission requirements in this part. We specify evaporative emission requirements for handheld and nonhandheld equipment separately in §§ 1054.110 and 1054.112.
