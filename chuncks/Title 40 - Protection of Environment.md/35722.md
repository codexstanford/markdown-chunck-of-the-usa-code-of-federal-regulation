######## Control efficiency, R.

(iv)Calculate the overall organic HAP control efficiency, R, achieved for each month using Equation 7 of this section:

(v) If demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP emission rate based on solids applied, measure the mass of each coating material applied on each work station during the month.

(vi) If demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP emission rate based on solids applied, determine the organic HAP content of each coating material applied during the month in accordance with ยง 63.5160(b).

(vii) If demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP emission rate based on solids applied, determine the solids content of each coating material applied during the month in accordance with ยง 63.5160(c).

(viii) If demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP emission rate based on solids applied, calculate the organic HAP emitted during the month, H, for each month using Equation 8 of this section:
