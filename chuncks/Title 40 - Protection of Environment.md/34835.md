######## Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation.

(f)Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during the compliance period. The emissions reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emissions reduction.
