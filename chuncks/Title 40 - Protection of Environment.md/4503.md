###### Calibration standards.

2.3.1Calibration standards are required for both NO and NO. The reference standard for the calibration may be either an NO or NOstandard, and must be traceable to a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) NO in NStandard Reference Material (SRM 1683 or SRM 1684), and NBS NOStandard Reference Material (SRM 1629), or an NBS/EPA-approved commercially available Certified Reference Material (CRM). CRM's are described in Reference 14, and a list of CRM sources is available from the address shown for Reference 14. Reference 15 gives recommended procedures for certifying an NO gas cylinder against an NO SRM or CRM and for certifying an NOpermeation device against an NOSRM. Reference 13 contains procedures for certifying an NO gas cylinder against an NOSRM and for certifying an NOpermeation device against an NO SRM or CRM. A procedure for determining the amount of NOimpurity in an NO cylinder is also contained in Reference 13. The NO or NOstandard selected as the reference standard must be used to certify the other standard to ensure consistency between the two standards.
