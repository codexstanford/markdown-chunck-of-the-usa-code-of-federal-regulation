###### ยง 180.582 Pyraclostrobin; tolerances for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide pyradostrobin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of pyraclostrobin (carbamic acid, [2-[[[ 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy] methyl]phenyl]methoxy-, methyl ester) and its desmethoxy metabolite (methyl-N-[[[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy]methyl] phenylcarbamate), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of pyraclostrobin, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for combined residues of the fungicide pyraclostrobin carbamic acid, [2-[[[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy]methyl]phenyl]methoxy-, methyl ester and its metabolites convertible to 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-ol and 1-(4-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-ol, expressed as parent compound, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities.
