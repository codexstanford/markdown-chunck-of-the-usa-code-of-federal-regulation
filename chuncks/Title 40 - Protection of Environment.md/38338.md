####### Reference Methods.

4.1.2.1The acceptable reference methods for the RATA of a sorbent trap monitoring system are the same as those listed in paragraph 4.1.1.5 of this section.

4.1.2.2 "The special considerations specified in paragraph 4.1.1.5.1 of this section apply to the RATA of a sorbent trap monitoring system. During the RATA, the monitoring system must be operated and quality-assured in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter with the following exceptions for sorbent trap section 2 breakthrough:

4.1.2.2.1 For stack Hg concentrations >1 µg/dscm, &#x2264;10% of section 1 Hg mass;

4.1.2.2.2 For stack Hg concentrations &#x2264;1 µg/dscm and >0.5 µg/dscm, &#x2264;20% of section 1 Hg mass;

4.1.2.2.3 For stack Hg concentrations &#x2264;0.5 µg/dscm and >0.1 µg/dscm, &#x2264;50% of section 1 Hg mass; and

4.1.2.2.4 For stack Hg concentrations &#x2264;0.1µg/dscm, no breakthrough criterion assuming all other QA/QC specifications are met.

4.1.2.3 The type of sorbent material used by the traps during the RATA must be the same as for daily operation of the monitoring system; however, the size of the traps used for the RATA may be smaller than the traps used for daily operation of the system.
