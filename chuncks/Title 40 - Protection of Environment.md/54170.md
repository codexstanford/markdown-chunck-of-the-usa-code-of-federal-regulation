####### Compliance schedules.

(4)The Director determines good cause exists for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy. However, in no case may an NPDES compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable CWA statutory deadline. See also § 122.63(c) (minor modifications) and paragraph (a)(14) of this section (NPDES innovative technology).

(5) When the permittee has filed a request for a variance under CWA section 301(c), 301(g), 301(h), 301(i), 301(k), or 316(a) or for "fundamentally different factors" within the time specified in § 122.21 or § 125.27(a).
