####### For new secondary containment units for stationary containers of liquid pesticides and new containment pads in pesticide dispensing areas, what are the capacity requirements?

(c)These are the capacity requirements:

(1) New secondary containment units for stationary containers of liquid pesticides, if protected from precipitation, must have a capacity of at least 100 percent of the volume of the largest stationary pesticide container plus the volume displaced by other containers and appurtenances within the unit.

(2) New secondary containment units for stationary containers of liquid pesticides, if exposed to or unprotected from precipitation, must have a capacity of at least 110 percent of the volume of the largest stationary pesticide container plus the volume displaced by other containers and appurtenances within the unit.

(3) New containment pads in pesticide dispensing areas which have a pesticide container or pesticide-holding equipment with a volume of 750 gallons or greater must have a holding capacity of at least 750 gallons.

(4) New containment pads in pesticide dispensing areas which do not have a pesticide container or pesticide-holding equipment with a volume of at least 750 gallons must have a holding capacity of at least 100 percent of the volume of the largest pesticide container or pesticide-holding equipment used on the pad.
