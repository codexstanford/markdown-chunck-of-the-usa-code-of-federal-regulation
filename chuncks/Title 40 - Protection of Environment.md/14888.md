####### Determination of Attainment.

(a)Effective June 14, 2021, based upon EPA's review of the available monitoring data, emissions data, and air quality modeling, EPA has determined that the Anderson and Freestone Counties and the Titus County nonattainment areas have attained the 2010 Primary 1-hour Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (2010 SONAAQS). Under the provisions of EPA's Clean Data Policy, this clean data determination suspends the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning State Implementation Plan revisions related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2010 SONAAQS or until the area is formally redesignated.
