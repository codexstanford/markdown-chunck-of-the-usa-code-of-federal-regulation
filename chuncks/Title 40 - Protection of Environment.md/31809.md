####### Equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor.

(2)(i) Valves, connectors, agitators, and any part of closed-vent systems may be designated as unsafe-to-monitor if the owner or operator determines that monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with the monitoring requirements identified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, or the inspection requirements identified in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.

(ii) The owner or operator of equipment that is designated as unsafe-to-monitor must have a written plan that requires monitoring of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times. For valves, connectors, and agitators, monitoring shall not be more frequent than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable to the group of processes in which the equipment is located. For closed-vent systems, inspections shall not be more frequent than annually.
