##### Subpart B - Monitoring Provisions
###### ยง 75.10 General operating requirements.
####### Minimum recording and recordkeeping requirements.
######## Moisture correction.

(b)If a correction for the stack gas moisture content is needed to properly calculate the NOemission rate in lb/mmBtu, e.g., if the NOpollutant concentration monitor measures on a different moisture basis from the diluent monitor, the owner or operator shall either report a fuel-specific default moisture value for each unit operating hour, as provided in ยง 75.11(b)(1), or shall install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system, as defined in ยง 75.11(b)(2). Notwithstanding this requirement, if Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to measure NOemission rate, the following fuel-specific default moisture percentages shall be used in lieu of the default values specified in ยง 75.11(b)(1): 5.0%, for anthracite coal; 8.0% for bituminous coal; 12.0% for sub-bituminous coal; 13.0% for lignite coal; 15.0% for wood and 18.0% for natural gas (boilers, only).
