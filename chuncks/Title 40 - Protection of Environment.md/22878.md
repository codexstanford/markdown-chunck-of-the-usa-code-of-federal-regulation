"REFUELING: During the refueling and rekindling of a cool fire, or a fire that has burned down to the charcoal phase, operate the stove at a medium to high firing rate for aboutminutes to ensure that the catalyst reaches approximately&#xB0;F."

Owner's manuals must include:

(a) Recommendation to visually inspect combustor at least three times during the heating season;

(b) Discussion on expected combustor temperatures for monitor-equipped units; and

(c) Suggested monitoring and inspection techniques and importance of ensuring catalyst is operating properly.

Exhibit 6-Example Text covering 2.3.6(a), (b) and (c) of this appendix:

"It is important to periodically monitor the operation of the catalytic combustor to ensure that it is functioning properly and to determine when it needs to be replaced. A non-functioning combustor will result in a loss of heating efficiency, and an increase in creosote and emissions. Following is a list of items that should be checked on a periodic basis:

- Combustors should be visually inspected at least three times during the heating season to determine if physical degradation has occurred. Actual removal of the combustor is not recommended unless more detailed inspection is warranted because of decreased performance. If any of these conditions exists, refer to Catalyst Troubleshooting section of this owner's manual.
