####### x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x

(a) If you remove water upstream of a concentration measurement,, correct for the removed water. Perform this correction based on the amount of water at the concentration measurement,, and at the flow meter,, whose flow is used to determine the mass emission rate or total mass over a test interval. For continuous analyzers downstream of a sample dryer for transient and ramped-modal cycles, you must apply this correction on a continuous basis over the test interval, even if you use one of the options in ยง 1065.145(e)(2) that results in a constant value forbecausevaries over the test interval. For batch analyzers, determine the flow-weighted average based on the continuousvalues determined as described in paragraph (c) of this section. For batch analyzers, you may determine the flow-weighted averagebased on a single value ofdetermined as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, using flow-weighted average or batch concentration inputs.
