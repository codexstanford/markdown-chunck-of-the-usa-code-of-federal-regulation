####### Active monitoring area

is the area that will be monitored over a specific time interval from the first year of the period (n) to the last year in the period (t). The boundary of the active monitoring area is established by superimposing two areas:

(1) The area projected to contain the free phase COplume at the end of year t, plus an all around buffer zone of one-half mile or greater if known leakage pathways extend laterally more than one-half mile.

(2) The area projected to contain the free phase COplume at the end of year t + 5.
