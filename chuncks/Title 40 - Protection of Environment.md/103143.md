(3) Perform a least-squares regression analysis to determine the best-fit coefficients for the equation and calculateas described in ยง 1065.602. When using Eq. 1065.640-12, treat Casand the radical term asand use Eq. 1065.602-12 to calculate. When using another mathematical expression, use the same approach to substitute that expression into the numerator of Eq. 1065.602-12 and replace the 2 in the denominator with the number of coefficients in the mathematical expression.
