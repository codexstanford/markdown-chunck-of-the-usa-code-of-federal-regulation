(2)(i) For the HPLC method describe and/or report:

(A) The method used to determine the sample-loop volume and the average and standard deviation of that volume.

(B) The average and standard deviation of the RF.

(C) The extraction solvent and the extraction efficiency used.

(D) Any changes made or problems encountered in the test procedures.

(ii) For the GC method report:

(A) The column and GC operating conditions of temperature and flow rate.

(B) The average and standard deviation of the average area per microliter obtained for each of the standard solutions.

(C) The form of the regression equation obtained in the calibration procedure.

(D) The extracting solvent and extraction efficiency used.

(E) The average and standard deviation of solute concentration in each collection vessel.

(F) Any changes made or problems encountered in the test procedure.

(iii) If another approved analytical method is used to determine the concentration of the test chemical in water, then all the important test conditions shall be reported.
