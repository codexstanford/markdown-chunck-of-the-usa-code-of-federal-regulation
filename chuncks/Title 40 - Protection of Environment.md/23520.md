###### ยง 61.347 Standards: Oil-water separators.

(a) Except as provided in ยง 61.352 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall meet the following standards for each oil-water separator in which waste is placed in accordance with ยง 61.342(c)(1)(ii) of this subpart:

(i) The fixed-roof shall meet the following requirements:

(A) The cover and all openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells) shall be designed to operate with no detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppmv above background, as determined initially and thereafter at least once per year by the methods specified in ยง 61.355(h) of this subpart.

(B) Each opening shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a lid that is gasketed and latched) at all times that waste is in the oil-water separator except when it is necessary to use the opening for waste sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

(C) If the cover and closed-vent system operate such that the oil-water separator is maintained at a pressure less than atmospheric pressure, then paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section does not apply to any opening that meets all of the following conditions:
