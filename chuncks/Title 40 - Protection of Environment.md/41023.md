(2)Where an owner or operator seeks to use an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber as a control device, the following information shall be recorded, as applicable:

(i) Where an absorber is used as the control device, the exit specific gravity and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or

(ii) Where a condenser is used as the control device, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or

(iii) Where a carbon adsorber is used as the control device, the total regeneration stream mass flow during each carbon-bed regeneration cycle during the period of the performance test measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test (full carbon-bed cycle), and temperature of the carbon-bed after each regeneration during the period of the performance test (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle or cycles); or

(iv) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the concentration level or reading indicated by the organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the performance test while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted; and

(v) For an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber used as a control device, the percent reduction of regulated material or TOC achieved by the control device determined as specified in ยง 65.158(b)(4), or the concentration of regulated material or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in ยง 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet of the control device.
