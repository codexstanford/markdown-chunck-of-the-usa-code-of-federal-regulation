####### Flexible connections.

(1)Use short flexible connectors where necessary.

(i) You may use flexible connectors to enlarge or reduce the pipe diameters to match that of your test equipment.

(ii) We recommend that you use flexible connectors that do not exceed a length of three times their largest inside diameter.

(iii) We recommend that you use four-ply silicone-fiberglass fabric with a temperature rating of at least 315 &#xB0;C for flexible connectors. You may use connectors with a spring-steel wire helix for support and you may use Nomexcoverings or linings for durability. You may also use any other nonreactive material with equivalent permeation-resistance and durability, as long as it seals tightly.

(iv) Use stainless-steel hose clamps to seal flexible connectors, or use clamps that seal equivalently.

(v) You may use additional flexible connectors to connect to flow meters.
