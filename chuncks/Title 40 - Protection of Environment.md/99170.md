####### Determining emission rates.

(b)To determine new emission rates for a derivative engine for demonstrating compliance with emission standards under ยง 1031.30(a)(4) and for showing emissions similarity in paragraph (c) of this section, testing may not be required in all situations. If the previously certificated engine model or any associated sub-models have a characteristic level before modification that is at or above 95% of any applicable standard for smoke number, HC, CO, or NOor at or above 80% of any applicable nvPM standard, you must test the proposed derivative engine. Otherwise, you may use engineering analysis to determine the new emission rates, consistent with good engineering judgment. The engineering analysis must address all modifications from the previously certificated engine, including those approved for previous derivative engines.
