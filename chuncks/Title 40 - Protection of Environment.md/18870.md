####### Solvent recovery system

means an air pollution control system by which VOC solvent vapors in air or other gases are captured and directed through a condenser(s) or a vessel(s) containing beds of activated carbon or other adsorbents. For the condensation method, the solvent is recovered directly from the condenser. For the adsorption method, the vapors are adsorbed, then desorbed by steam or other media, and finally condensed and recovered.
