(1)If you use CEMS (or, if applicable, sorbent trap monitoring systems) to comply with a heat input-based emission rate limit, you may use the following diluent cap values for a startup or shutdown hour in which the measured COconcentration is below the cap value or the measured Oconcentration is above the cap value:

(i) For an IGCC EGU, you may use 1% for COor 19% for O.

(ii) For all other EGUs, you may use 5% for COor 14% for O.
