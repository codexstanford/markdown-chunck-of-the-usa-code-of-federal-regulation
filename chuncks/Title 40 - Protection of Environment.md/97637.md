####### v

() Remove the weighing bottle, cap it, and replace it with the waste container. Determine the weight of water collected to the nearest mg and record the corresponding peak area. Using the same AUFS setting repeat the analysis of the solute at least two more times and determine the average ratio of peak area to grams of water collected. In this equation, s = solubility (M), RF = response factor, V= sample-loop volume (L), and R = ratio of area to grams of water. Calculate the solute solubility in water using the following equation:
