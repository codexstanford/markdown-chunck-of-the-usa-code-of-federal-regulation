(ii) Engines must meet a NOstandard when tested over the Low Load Cycle as described in § 1036.514. Engines must also meet an off-cycle NOstandard as specified in § 1036.104(a)(3). Calculate the NOfamily emission limits for the Low Load Cycle and for off-cycle testing as described in § 1036.104(c)(3) withset to 35 mg/hp&#xB7;hr andset to the values specified in § 1036.104(a)(2) or (3), respectively. No standard applies for HC, PM, and CO emissions for the Low Load Cycle or for off-cycle testing, but you must record measured values for those pollutants and include those measured values where you report NOemission results.

(iii) For engines selected for in-use testing, we may specify that you perform testing as described in 40 CFR part 86, subpart T, or as described in subpart E of this part.
