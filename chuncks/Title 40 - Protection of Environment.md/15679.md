###### ยง 53.33 Test Procedure for Methods for Lead (Pb).
####### Analytical Bias.

(i)(1) For the audit samples, calculate the average Pb concentration for each strip or filter analyzed by the reference method by averaging the concentrations calculated from the three analyses as described in (g)(1) using equation 2 of this section:

(2) Calculate the percent difference (D) between the average Pb concentration for each audit sample and the true Pb concentration (T) using equation 3 of this section:

(3) If any difference value (D) exceeds +/-5 percent, the bias of the reference method analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the source of the error(s) (e.g., calibration standard discrepancies, extraction problems, etc.) and the reference method and audit sample determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (g) of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph (e) of this section) must be repeated.
