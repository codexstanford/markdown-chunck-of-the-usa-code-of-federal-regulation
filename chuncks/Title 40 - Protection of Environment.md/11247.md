####### Determination of Attainment:

(p)Effective February 28, 2022, the EPA has determined that, based on 2018 to 2020 ambient air quality data, the San Joaquin Valley PMnonattainment area has attained the 1997 24-hour PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2020. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA sections 179(c)(1) and 188(b)(2) to determine whether the area attained the standard. The EPA has also determined that, based on the determination of attainment by the applicable attainment date, the requirement of CAA section 172(c)(9) to provide for contingency measures no longer applies to the San Joaquin Valley area for the 1997 24-hour PMNAAQS.
