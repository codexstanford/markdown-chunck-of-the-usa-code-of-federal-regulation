###### What This Subpart Covers
####### ยง 63.6095 When do I have to comply with this subpart?
######## Affected sources.

(a)(1) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 5, 2004.

(2) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.

(3) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 9, 2022.

(4) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
