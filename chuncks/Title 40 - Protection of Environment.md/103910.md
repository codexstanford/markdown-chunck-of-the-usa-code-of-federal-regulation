####### Calculations.

(g)(1) Determine the mass of COemissions for each of the two test intervals as described in ยง 1066.605.

(2) Calculate separate composite mass-weighted emissions of CO,, representing the average of the SC03 and HFET emissions, in grams per mile for operation with the vehicle's air conditioner and the solar heating on and off using the following equation:
