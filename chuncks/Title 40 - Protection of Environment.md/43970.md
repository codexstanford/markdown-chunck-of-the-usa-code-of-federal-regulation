() A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether theordoes or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer. This letter shall also include USDA's recommendation of whether it is appropriate to require the use of a financial mechanism to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the invasive spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.
