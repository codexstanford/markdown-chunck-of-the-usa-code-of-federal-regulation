(3)EPA will assess whether the circumstances identified in the request constitute condition of use under ยง 702.33, and whether those conditions of use warrant inclusion within the scope of a risk evaluation for the chemical substance. EPA will also assess what, if any, additional conditions of use that warrant inclusion within the scope of a risk evaluation for the chemical substance.
