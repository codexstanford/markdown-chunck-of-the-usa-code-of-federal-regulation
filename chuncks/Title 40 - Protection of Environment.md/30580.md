###### § 63.1253 Standards: Storage tanks.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the owner or operator of a storage tank meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the owner or operator of a storage tank meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is demonstrated using the initial compliance procedures in § 63.1257(c) and the monitoring requirements in § 63.1258.

(1) A storage tank with a design capacity greater than or equal to 38 mbut less than 75 mstoring a liquid for which the maximum true vapor pressure of total HAP is greater than or equal to 13.1 kPa.

(2) A storage tank with a design capacity greater than or equal to 75 mstoring a liquid for which the maximum true vapor pressure of total HAP is greater than or equal to 13.1 kPa.

(b) The owner or operator of a storage tank shall equip the affected storage tank with either a fixed roof with internal floating roof, an external floating roof, an external floating roof converted to an internal floating roof, or a closed-vent system meeting the conditions of § 63.1252(b) with a control device that meets any of the following conditions:

(1) Reduces inlet emissions of total HAP by 90 percent by weight or greater;

(2) Reduces emissions to outlet concentrations less than or equal to 20 ppmv as TOC and less than or equal to 20 ppmv as hydrogen halides and halogens;

(3) Is an enclosed combustion device that provides a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds at a minimum temperature of 760 &#xB0;C;

(4) Is a flare that meets the requirements of § 63.11(b); or

(5) Is a control device specified in § 63.1257(a)(4).

(c) The owner or operator of a storage tank shall equip the affected storage tank with either a fixed roof with internal floating roof, an external floating roof, an external floating roof converted to an internal floating roof, or a closed-vent system meeting the conditions of § 63.1252(b) with a control device that meets any of the following conditions:

(1) Reduces inlet emissions of total HAP as specified in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section:

(i) By 95 percent by weight or greater; or (ii) If the owner or operator can demonstrate that a control device installed on a storage tank on or before April 2, 1997 is designed to reduce inlet emissions of total HAP by greater than or equal to 90 percent by weight but less than 95 percent by weight, then the control device is required to be operated to reduce inlet emissions of total HAP by 90 percent or greater.

(2) Reduces emissions to outlet concentrations less than or equal to 20 ppmv as TOC and less than or equal to 20 ppmv as hydrogen halides and halogens;

(3) Is an enclosed combustion device that provides a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds at a minimum temperature of 760 &#xB0;C;

(4) Is a flare that meets the requirements of § 63.11(b); or

(5) Is a control device specified in § 63.1257(a)(4).

(d) As an alternative standard, the owner or operator of an existing or new affected source may comply with the storage tank standards by routing storage tank vents to a combustion control device achieving an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on methane or the predominant HAP, of 20 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 20 ppmv or less. If the owner or operator is routing emissions to a noncombustion control device, it must achieve an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on methane or the predominant HAP, of 50 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 50 ppmv or less. Compliance with the outlet concentrations shall be determined by the initial compliance procedures of § 63.1257(c)(4) and the continuous emission monitoring requirements of § 63.1258(b)(5).
