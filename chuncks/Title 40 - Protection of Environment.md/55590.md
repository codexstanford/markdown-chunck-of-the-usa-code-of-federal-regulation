(2) The MDL procedure isapplicable to methods that do not produce results with a continuous distribution, such as, but not limited to, methods for whole effluent toxicity, presence/absence methods, and microbiological methods that involve counting colonies. The MDL procedure also isapplicable to measurements such as, but not limited to, biochemical oxygen demand, color, pH, specific conductance, many titration methods, and any method where low-level spiked samples cannot be prepared. Except as described in the addendum, for the purposes of this procedure, "spiked samples" are prepared from a clean reference matrix, such as reagent water, spiked with a known and consistent quantity of the analyte. MDL determinations using spiked samples may not be appropriate for all gravimetric methods (e.g., residue or total suspended solids), but an MDL based on method blanks can be determined in such instances.

(1) Estimate the initial MDL using one or more of the following:

(a) The mean determined concentration plus three times the standard deviation of a set of method blanks.

(b) The concentration value that corresponds to an instrument signal-to-noise ratio in the range of 3 to 5.

(c) The concentration equivalent to three times the standard deviation of replicate instrumental measurements of spiked blanks.
