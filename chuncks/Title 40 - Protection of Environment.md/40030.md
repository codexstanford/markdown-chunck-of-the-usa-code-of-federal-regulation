###### Matrix Spiking,prior,e.g.,,after,measurement

3.14-Analytical spikes that have been added to the actual sample matrix either before (Section 9.2.5.2) or after (Section 9.1.6). Spikes added to the sampleto a preparation technique (digestion) allow for the assessment of an overall method accuracy while those addedonly provide for theaccuracy determination.

4.1 ICP Interferences.

4.1.1 ICP Spectral Interferences. Spectral interferences are caused by: overlap of a spectral line from another element; unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra; background contribution from continuous or recombination phenomena; and, stray light from the line emission of high-concentrated elements. Spectral overlap may be compensated for by correcting the raw data with a computer and measuring the interfering element. At the 267.72 nm Cr analytical wavelength, iron, manganese, and uranium are potential interfering elements. Background and stray light interferences can usually be compensated for by a background correction adjacent to the analytical line. Unresolved overlap requires the selection of an alternative chromium wavelength. Consult the instrument manufacturer's operation manual for interference correction procedures.
