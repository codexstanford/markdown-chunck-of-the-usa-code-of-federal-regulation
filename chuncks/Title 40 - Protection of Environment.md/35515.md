######## Inclusion with title V report.

(2)Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the 6-month monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the 6-month monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all information required by the part 70 or part 71 6-month monitoring report concerning deviations from the requirements of this subpart as defined in ยง 63.4981, the submission of the semiannual compliance report shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviation information in the part 70 or part 71 6-month monitoring report. However, in such situations, the 6-month monitoring report must cross-reference the semiannual compliance report, and submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.
