(8) Where each person who is reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance by inhalation in the work area in one or more of the forms listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section and cited in subpart E of this part for the chemical substance, engineering control measures (enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or inhalation exposure is still reasonably likely, each person who is reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance by inhalation in the work area in one or more of the forms listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section and cited in subpart E of this part for the chemical substance, must be provided with, and is required to wear, a NIOSH- certified respirator from one of the categories listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.134 and 42 CFR part 84 for requirements on the selection, use, and maintenance of respirators, including establishing respiratory protection program, medical determination, and other administrative and programmatic requirements for respiratory protection.

(b) If a substance identified in subpart E of this part is present in the work area only as a mixture, an employer is exempt from the provisions of this section if the concentration of the substance in the mixture does not exceed a concentration set in subpart E of this part. The exemption does not apply if the employer has reason to believe that during intended use or processing in the work area, the substance in the mixture may be concentrated above the level set in subpart E of this part.

(c)(1) If at any time after commencing distribution in commerce of a chemical substance that is identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section, the person has knowledge that a recipient of the substance is engaging in an activity that is not consistent with the implementation of a program specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the person is considered to have knowledge that the recipient is engaging in a significant new use and is required to follow the procedures in ยง 721.5(d) unless the person is able to document the following:

(i) That the person has notified the recipient in writing within 15 working days of the time the person first has knowledge that the recipient is engaging in an activity that is not consistent with the implementation of a program specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and that the person has knowledge of the failure of implementation.

(ii) That within 15 working days of notifying the recipient that the recipient is engaging in an activity that is not consistent with the implementation of a program specified in paragraph (a) of this section the person has received from the recipient, in writing, a statement of assurance that the recipient has established the program required under paragraph (a) of this section, and will take appropriate measures to avoid activities that are inconsistent with implementation of the program required under paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) If, after receiving a statement of assurance from a recipient under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a manufacturer or processor has knowledge that the recipient is engaging in an activity that is not consistent with the implementation of the program specified in paragraph (a) of this section, that person is considered to have knowledge that the person is engaging in a significant new use and is required to follow the procedures in ยง 721.5(d).
