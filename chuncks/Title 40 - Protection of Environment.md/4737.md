###### Extra samples

are non-creditable samples. They are daily values that do not occur on scheduled sampling days and that can not be used as "make-up samples" for missed or invalidated scheduled samples. Extra samples are used in mean calculations. For purposes of determining whether a sample must be treated as a make-up sample or an extra sample, Pb-TSP and Pb-PMdata collected before January 1, 2009 will be treated with an assumed scheduled sampling frequency of every sixth day.
