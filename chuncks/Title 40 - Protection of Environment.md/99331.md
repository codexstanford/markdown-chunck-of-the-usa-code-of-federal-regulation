####### Temperature.

(a)(1) Testing may be performed with ambient temperatures from 15.5 &#xB0;C (60 &#xB0;F) to 40.5 &#xB0;C (105 &#xB0;F). Do not correct emissions for temperature effects within this range.

(2) It is presumed that combustion air will be drawn from the ambient air. Thus, the ambient temperature limits of this paragraph (a) apply for intake air upstream of the engine. If you do not draw combustion air from the ambient air, use good engineering judgment to ensure that any temperature difference (between the ambient air and combustion air) does not cause the emission measurement to be unrepresentative of in-use emissions.

(3) If we allow you to perform testing at ambient temperatures below 15.5 &#xB0;C, you must correct NOemissions for temperature effects, consistent with good engineering judgment. For example, if the intake air temperature (at the manifold) is lower at the test temperature than it would be for equivalent operation at an ambient temperature of 15.5 &#xB0;C, you generally will need to adjust your measured NOemissions to account for the effect of the lower intake air temperature. However, if you maintain a constant manifold air temperature, you will generally not need to correct emissions.
