(a) Any liquid cane sugar refinery discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waters shall meet the following limitations. The BODlimitation is determined by the addition of the net BODattributed to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BODattributed to the treated process water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributed to the treated process water. Where the barometric condenser cooling water and process water streams are mixed and impossible to measure separately prior to discharge, the values should be considered net.

(b) Any liquid cane sugar refinery discharging barometric condenser cooling water only shall meet the following net limitations:
