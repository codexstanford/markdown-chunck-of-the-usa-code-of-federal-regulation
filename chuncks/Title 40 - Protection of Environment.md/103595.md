######## Determination of accelerated fuel sulfur exposure targets.

(1)The target sulfur exposure rate for fuel-related sulfur is determined by utilizing the field mean fuel rate data for the engine determined in ยง 1065.1133(a)(3). Calculate the total sulfur exposure mass using this mean fuel rate, the total number of non-accelerated hours to reach full useful life, and a fuel sulfur level of 10 ppmw.
