###### Calibration Attenuators.,e.g.,

6.2You, as owner or operator, are responsible for purchasing a minimum of three calibration attenuators that meet the requirements of PS-1. Calibration attenuators are optical filters with neutral spectral characteristics. Calibration attenuators must meet the requirements in section 7 and must be of sufficient size to attenuate the entire light beam received by the detector of the COMS. For transmissometers operating over a narrow bandwidth (laser), a calibration attenuator's value is determined for the actual operating wavelengths of the transmissometer. Some filters may not be uniform across the face. If errors result in the daily calibration drift or calibration error test, you may want to examine the across-face uniformity of the filter.
