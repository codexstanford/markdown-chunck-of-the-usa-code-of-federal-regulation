####### Batch emission episode

means a discrete venting episode that may be associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode per batch cycle. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with organic HAP will result in a discrete emission episode. If the vessel is then heated, there may also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Both emission episodes may occur during the same batch cycle in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process operations.
