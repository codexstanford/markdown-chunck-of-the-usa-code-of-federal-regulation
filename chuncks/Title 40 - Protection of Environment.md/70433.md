###### Potential to release by flood.

4.1.2.1.2.2Evaluate potential to release by flood for each watershed as the product of two factors: containment (flood) and flood frequency. Evaluate potential to release by flood separately for each source that is within the watershed. Furthermore, for each source, evaluate potential to release by flood separately for each category of floodplain in which the source lies. (See section 4.1.2.1.2.2.2 for the applicable floodplain categories.) Calculate the value for the potential to release by flood factor as specified in 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.
