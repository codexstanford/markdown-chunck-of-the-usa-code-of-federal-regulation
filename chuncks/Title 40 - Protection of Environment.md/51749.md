####### Sinter process

means a process that produces a fused aggregate of fine iron-bearing materials suited for use in a blast furnace. The sinter machine is composed of a continuous traveling grate that conveys a bed of ore fines and other finely divided iron-bearing material and fuel (typically coke breeze), a burner at the feed end of the grate for ignition, and a series of downdraft windboxes along the length of the strand to support downdraft combustion and heat sufficient to produce a fused sinter product.
