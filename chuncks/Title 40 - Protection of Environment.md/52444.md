####### Method for determining emissions from blowdown vent stacks according to equipment or event type.,i.e.,,i.e.,,e.g.,,e.g.,,e.g.

(2)If you elect to determine emissions according to each equipment or event type, using unique physical volumes as calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, you must calculate emissions as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (i)(2)(ii) or, if applicable, paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section for each equipment or event type. For industry segments other than onshore natural gas transmission pipeline, equipment or event types must be grouped into the following seven categories: Facility piping (piping within the facility boundary other than physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines), pipeline venting (physical volumes associated with distribution pipelines vented within the facility boundary), compressors, scrubbers/strainers, pig launchers and receivers, emergency shutdowns (this category includes emergency shutdown blowdown emissions regardless of equipment type), and all other equipment with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple equipment types and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different equipment types, then categorize the blowdown event as the equipment type that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event. For the onshore natural gas transmission pipeline segment, pipeline segments or event types must be grouped into the following eight categories: Pipeline integrity work (the preparation work of modifying facilities, ongoing assessments, maintenance or mitigation), traditional operations or pipeline maintenance, equipment replacement or repair (valves), pipe abandonment, new construction or modification of pipelines including commissioning and change of service, operational precaution during activities (excavation near pipelines), emergency shutdowns including pipeline incidents as defined in 49 CFR 191.3, and all other pipeline segments with a physical volume greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet. If a blowdown event resulted in emissions from multiple categories and the emissions cannot be apportioned to the different categories, then categorize the blowdown event in the category that represented the largest portion of the emissions for the blowdown event.

(i) Calculate the total annual natural gas emissions from each unique physical volume that is blown down using either Equation W-14A or W-14B of this section.

(ii) Except as allowed in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, calculate annual CHand COvolumetric and mass emissions from each unique physical volume that is blown down by using the annual natural gas emission value as calculated in either Equation W-14A or Equation W-14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Calculate the total annual CHand COemissions for each equipment or event type by summing the annual CHand COmass emissions for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment or event type.

(iii) For onshore natural gas transmission compression facilities and LNG import and export equipment, as an alternative to using the procedures in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, you may elect to sum the annual natural gas emissions as calculated using either Equation W-14A or Equation W-14B of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section for all unique physical volumes associated with the equipment type or event type. Calculate the total annual CHand COvolumetric and mass emissions for each equipment type or event type using the sums of the total annual natural gas emissions for each equipment type and the calculation method specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.
