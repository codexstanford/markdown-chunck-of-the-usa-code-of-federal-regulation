###### Experimental design.

4.7.1The experimental design for this test is known as a factorial experiment with two factors. The first factor is product/control group; the second factor is time (measured in days). For example, if two groups (product A and a non-nutrient control) are tested at each of three points in time (day 0, 7, and 28), the experiment is called a 2 x 3 factorial experiment. There will be three replications (replicated shaker flasks) of each group-time combination.
