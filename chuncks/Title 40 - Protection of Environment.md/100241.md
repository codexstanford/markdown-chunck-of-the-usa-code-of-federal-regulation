(1) The Overall Vehicle Reynolds number,, must be at least 1.0&#xB7;10. Tests for Reynolds effects described in Section 7.1 of SAE J1252 are not required.

(2) For full-scale wind tunnel tractor testing, use good engineering judgment to select a trailer that is a reasonable representation of the trailer used for reference coastdown testing. For example, where your wind tunnel is not long enough to test the tractor with a standard 53 foot box van, it may be appropriate to use a shorter box van. In such a case, the correlation developed using the shorter trailer would only be valid for testing with the shorter trailer.

(3) For reduced-scale wind tunnel testing, use a one-eighth or larger scale model of a tractor and trailer that is sufficient to simulate airflow through the radiator inlet grill and across an engine geometry that represents engines commonly used in your test vehicle.

(b) Open-throat wind tunnels must also meet the specifications of SAE J2071 (incorporated by reference in § 1037.810).
