####### i.e.,

(B) After 120 days and no more than 364 days of operation after the compliance dates specified in § 63.760(f), the owner or operator shall calculate the average HAP emission reduction as the HAP emission reduction averaged over the number of days between the current day and the applicable compliance date. For sources required to meet the overall 95.0-percent reduction requirement, compliance with the performance requirements is achieved if the average HAP emission reduction is equal to or greater than 90.0 percent. For sources required to meet the BTEX limit under § 63.765(b)(1)(iii), compliance is achieved if the average BTEX emission reduction is at least 95.0 percent of the required 365-day value identified under paragraph (g)(1) of this section (at least 76.0 percent if the 365-day design value is 80.0 percent).

(3) If the owner or operator has data for 365 days or more of operation, compliance is achieved based on the applicable criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) For sources meeting the HAP emission reduction specified in § 63.771(d)(1)(ii) or (e)(3) the average HAP emission reduction calculated in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent.

(ii) For sources required to meet the BTEX limit under § 63.771(e)(3) or (f)(1), compliance is achieved if the average BTEX emission reduction calculated in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section is equal to or greater than the minimum percent reduction identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
