####### Erosion and sediment controls.

(a)Design, install and maintain effective erosion controls and sediment controls to minimize the discharge of pollutants. At a minimum, such controls must be designed, installed and maintained to:

(1) Control stormwater volume and velocity to minimize soil erosion in order to minimize pollutant discharges;

(2) Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flowrates and total stormwater volume, to minimize channel and streambank erosion and scour in the immediate vicinity of discharge points;

(3) Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activity;

(4) Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes;
