####### Special test procedures.
######## i.e.,

(iv) Carbon weight fraction of the fuel, which equals the total weight of carbon in the fuel (includes carbon contained in hydrocarbons and in CO) divided by the total weight of fuel.

(4) Ethanol test fuel shall be analyzed to determine the following fuel properties:

(i) Specific gravity using ASTM D 1298 (incorporated by reference in ยง 600.011). You may determine specific gravity for the blend, or you may determine specific gravity for the gasoline and methanol fuel components separately before combining the results using the following equation:

(ii)(A) Carbon weight fraction using the following equation:

(B) Upon the approval of the Administrator, other procedures to measure the carbon weight fraction of the fuel blend may be used if the manufacturer can show that the procedures are superior to or equally as accurate as those specified in this paragraph (f)(4)(ii).

(g) Calculate separate FTP, highway, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emissions from the grams/mile values for total HC, CO, COand, where applicable, CHOH, CHOH, CHO, HCHO, NMHC, NO, and CH, and the test fuel's specific gravity, carbon weight fraction, net heating value, and additionally for natural gas, the test fuel's composition.
