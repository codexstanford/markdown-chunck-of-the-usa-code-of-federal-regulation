(1) Convert your measured concentrations such as,,, and, to dry concentrations by dividing them by one minus the amount of water present during their respective measurements; for example:,, and. If the amount of water present during a "wet" measurement is the same as the unknown amount of water in the exhaust flow,, iteratively solve for that value in the system of equations. If you measure only total NOand not NO and NOseparately, use good engineering judgment to estimate a split in your total NOconcentration between NO and NOfor the chemical balances. For example, if you measure emissions from a stoichiometric spark-ignition engine, you may assume all NOis NO. For a compression-ignition engine, you may assume that your molar concentration of NO,, is 75% NO and 25% NO. For NOstorage aftertreatment systems, you may assumeis 25% NO and 75% NO. Note that for calculating the mass of NOemissions, you must use the molar mass of NOfor the effective molar mass of all NOspecies, regardless of the actual NOfraction of NO.
