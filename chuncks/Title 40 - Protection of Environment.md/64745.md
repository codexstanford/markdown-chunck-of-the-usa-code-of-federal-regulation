####### procurement actions

(b) The termincludes:

(1) Purchases made directly by a procuring agency and purchases made directly by any person (e.g., a contractor) in support of work being performed for a procuring agency, and

(2) Any purchases of designated items made "indirectly" by a procuring agency, as in the case of procurements resulting from grants, loans, funds, and similar forms of disbursements of monies.

(c)(1) This guideline does not apply to purchases of designated items which are unrelated to or incidental to Federal funding, i.e., not the direct result of a contract or agreement with, or a grant, loan, or funds disbursement to, a procuring agency.

(2) This guideline also does not apply to purchases made by private party recipients (e.g., individuals, non-profit organizations) of Federal funds pursuant to grants, loans, cooperative agreements, and other funds disbursements.

(d) RCRA section 6002(c)(1) requires procuring agencies to procure designated items composed of the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, considering such guidelines. Procuring agencies may decide not to procure such items if they are not reasonably available in a reasonable period of time; fail to meet reasonable performance standards; or are only available at an unreasonable price.
