###### Nearest well.

3.3.1In evaluating the nearest well factor, include both the drinking water wells drawing from the aquifer being evaluated and those drawing from overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. Include standby wells in evaluating this factor only if they are used for drinking water supply at least once every year.

If there is an observed release by direct observation for a drinking water well within the target distance limit, assign Level II concentrations to that well. However, if one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release for that well, determine if that well is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination.

Assign a value for the nearest well factor as follows:

- If one or more drinking water wells is subject to Level I concentrations, assign a value of 50.

- If not, but if one or more drinking water wells is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.

- If none of the drinking water wells is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a value as follows:

Enter the value assigned to the nearest well factor in table 3-1.
