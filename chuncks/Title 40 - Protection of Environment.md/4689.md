####### Calibration.

9Calibration of the flow rate, temperature measurement, and pressure measurement systems for both the PMand PMsamplers shall be as specified in section 9 of appendix L to this part.

10.1 The PMand PMsamplers shall be installed at the monitoring site such that their ambient air inlets differ in vertical height by not more than 0.2 meter, if possible, but in any case not more than 1 meter, and the vertical axes of their inlets are separated by at least 1 meter but not more than 4 meters, horizontally.

10.2 The measurement procedure for PMshall be as specified in section 10 of appendix L to this part, with "PM" substituted for "PM" wherever it occurs in that section.

10.3 The measurement procedure for PMshall be as specified in section 10 of appendix L to this part.

10.4 For the PMmeasurement, the PMand PMsamplers shall be programmed to operate on the same schedule and such that the sample period start times are within 5 minutes and the sample duration times are within 5 minutes.

10.5 Retrieval, transport, and storage of each PMand PMsample pair following sample collection shall be matched to the extent practical such that both samples experience uniform conditions.
