###### Mass Flow Meters/Controllers.

6.3To accurately measure analyte spike flow rate, having the appropriate calibrated range and a stated accuracy of +/-2 percent of the absolute measurement value. This device must be calibrated with the major component of the calibration/spike gas (e.g., nitrogen) using an NIST traceable bubble meter or equivalent. Single point calibration checks should be performed daily in the field. When spiking HCl, the mass flow meter/controller should be thoroughly purged before and after introduction of the gas to prevent corrosion of the interior parts.
