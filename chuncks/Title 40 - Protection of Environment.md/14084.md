####### Method for cement kilns.

(4)(i) The owner/operator of each unit shall record the daily clinker production rates.

(ii) The owner/operator of each unit shall calculate and record the 30-operating day rolling emission rates of SOand NO, in lb/ton of clinker produced, as the total of all hourly emissions data for the cement kiln in the preceding 30 days, divided by the total tons of clinker produced in that kiln during the same 30-day operating period, using the following equation:

For each kiln operating hour for which the owner/operator does not have at least one valid 15-minute CEMS data value, the owner/operator must use the average emissions rate (lb/hr) from the most recent previous hour for which valid data are available. Hourly clinker production shall be determined by the owner/operator in accordance with the requirements found at 40 CFR 60.63(b).

(iii) At the end of each kiln operating day, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/ton clinker from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates for the current kiln operating day and the previous 29 successive kiln operating days.
