(9) Measure the humidified NO span gas concentration with the CLD analyzer. Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization time may include time to purge the transfer line and to account for analyzer response. While the analyzer measures the sample's concentration, record the analyzer's output for 30 seconds. Calculate the arithmetic mean of these data,. Recordand use it in the quench verification calculations in ยง 1065.675.
