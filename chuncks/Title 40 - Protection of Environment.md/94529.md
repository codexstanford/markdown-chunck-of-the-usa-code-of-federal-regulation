####### Damaged friable surfacing ACM

means friable surfacing ACM which has deteriorated or sustained physical injury such that the internal structure (cohesion) of the material is inadequate or which has delaminated such that its bond to the substrate (adhesion) is inadequate, or which, for any other reason, lacks fiber cohesion or adhesion qualities. Such damage or deterioration may be illustrated by the separation of ACM into layers; separation of ACM from the substrate; flaking, blistering, or crumbling of the ACM surface; water damage; significant or repeated water stains, scrapes, gouges, mars or other signs of physical injury on the ACM. Asbestos debris originating from the ACBM in question may also indicate damage.
