###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from continuous monitoring of manifolded group of reciprocating compressor sources.

(9)For a manifolded group of compressor sources measured according to paragraph (p)(1)(iv) of this section, you must use the continuous volumetric emission measurements taken as specified in paragraph (p)(5) of this section and calculate annual volumetric GHG emissions associated with each manifolded group of compressor sources using Equation W-29C of this section. If the reciprocating compressors included in the manifolded group of compressor sources share the manifold with centrifugal compressors, you must follow the procedures in either this paragraph (p)(9) or paragraph (o)(9) of this section to calculate emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources.
