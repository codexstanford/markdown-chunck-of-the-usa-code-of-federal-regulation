2.4.1.2 To prepare the standards, prepare a parent oil-DCM standard by mixing 1 part oil (pluspart premixed dispersant, if applicable) to 9 parts DCM (, 1:10 dilution of the oil v:v). Add a specific volume of the parent oil-DCM standard to 30 ml of synthetic seawater in a separatory funnel. Extract the oil-water mixture with 5-ml volumes of DCM after 15 seconds of vigorous shaking followed by a 2 minute stationary period to allow for phase separation for each extraction. Repeat the extraction using a total of three 5-ml portions of DCM. Adjust the final DCM volume for the combined extracts to 20 ml with DCM in a 25-ml graduated cylinder.

2.4.1.3 The quantities of oil used to achieve the desired concentrations in the final 20-ml DCM extracts for the standard oil-solutions are summarized in table 3. Specific masses for oil amounts in standards are determined as volumes of oil multiplied by the density of the oil.
