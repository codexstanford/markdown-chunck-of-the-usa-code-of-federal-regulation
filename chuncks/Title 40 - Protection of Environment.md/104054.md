###### ยง 1068.32 Explanatory terms.
####### Exceptions and other specifications.

(h)Regulatory provisions may be expressed as a general prohibition, requirement, or allowance that is modified by other regulatory text. Such provisions may include phrases such as "unless specified otherwise", "except as specified", or "as specified in this section". It is important that the exceptions and the more general statement be considered together. This regulatory construct is intended to allow the core requirement or allowance to be stated in simple, clear sentences, rather than more precise and comprehensive sentences that may be misread. For example, where an action is prohibited in most but not all circumstances, the provision may state that you may not take the action, "except as specified in this section." The exceptions could then be stated in subsequent regulatory text.
