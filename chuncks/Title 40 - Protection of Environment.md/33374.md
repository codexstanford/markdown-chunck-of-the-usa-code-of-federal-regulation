(a) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review as specified in ยง 63.10(b)(1).

(b) As specified in ยง 63.10(b)(1), you must keep each record for 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record.

(c) You must keep each record on site for at least 2 years after the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record according to ยง 63.10(b)(1). You can keep the records offsite for the remaining 3 years.
