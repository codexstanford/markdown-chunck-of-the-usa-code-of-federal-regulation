###### Design Criteria
####### ยง 257.71 Liner design criteria for existing CCR surface impoundments.
######## Alternate Liner Demonstration Package.

(ii)The completed alternate liner demonstration package must be certified by a qualified professional engineer. The package must present evidence to demonstrate that, based on the construction of the unit and surrounding site conditions, there is no reasonable probability that operation of the surface impoundment will result in concentrations of constituents listed in appendix IV to this part in the uppermost aquifer at levels above a groundwater protection standard. For each line of evidence, as well as any other data and assumptions incorporated into the demonstration, the owner or operator of the CCR surface impoundment must include documentation on how the data were collected and why these data and assumptions adequately reflect potential contaminant transport from that specific impoundment. The alternate liner demonstration at a minimum must contain all of the following lines of evidence:
