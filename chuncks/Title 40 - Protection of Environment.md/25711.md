###### § 63.117 Process vent provisions - reporting and recordkeeping requirements for group and TRE determinations and performance tests.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to the control provisions for Group 1 process vents in § 63.113(a) or the provisions for Group 2 process vents with a TRE index value greater than 1.0 but less than or equal to 4.0 in § 63.113(d) shall:

(1) Keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the data specified in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(8) of this section, as applicable, and

(2) Include the data in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(8) of this section in the Notification of Compliance Status report as specified in § 63.152(b) of this subpart.

(3) If any subsequent TRE determinations or performance tests are conducted after the Notification of Compliance Status has been submitted, report the data in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(8) of this section in the next Periodic Report as specified in § 63.152(c) of this subpart.

(4) Record and report the following when using a combustion device to achieve a 98 weight percent reduction in organic HAP or an organic HAP concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, as specified in § 63.113(a)(2) of this subpart:

(i) The parameter monitoring results for incinerators, catalytic incinerators, boilers or process heaters specified in table 3 of this subpart, and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing.

(ii) For an incinerator, the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC achieved by the incinerator determined as specified in § 63.116(c) of this subpart, or the concentration of organic HAP or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in § 63.116(c) of this subpart at the outlet of the incinerator on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.

(iii) For a boiler or process heater, a description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater.

(iv) For a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 megawatts and where the vent stream is introduced with combustion air or used as a secondary fuel and is not mixed with the primary fuel, the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC, or the concentration of organic HAP or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as specified in § 63.116(c) at the outlet of the combustion device on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.

(5) Record and report the following when using a flare to comply with § 63.113(a)(1) of this subpart:

(i) Flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted, or non-assisted);

(ii) All visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the compliance determination required by § 63.116(a) of this subpart; and

(iii) All periods during the compliance determination when the pilot flame is absent.

(6) Record and report the following when using a scrubber following a combustion device to control a halogenated vent stream:

(i) The percent reduction or scrubber outlet mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens as specified in § 63.116(d) of this subpart;

(ii) The pH of the scrubber effluent; and

(iii) The scrubber liquid to gas ratio.

(7) Record and report the following when achieving and maintaining a TRE index value greater than 1.0 but less than 4.0 as specified in § 63.113(a)(3) or § 63.113(d) of this subpart:

(i) The parameter monitoring results for absorbers, condensers, or carbon adsorbers, as specified in table 4 of this subpart, and averaged over the same time period of the measurements of vent stream flow rate and concentration used in the TRE determination (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), and

(ii) The measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.

(8) Record and report the halogen concentration in the vent stream determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.115(d)(2)(v).

(b) The owner or operator of a Group 2 process vent with a TRE index greater than 4.0 as specified in § 63.113(e) of this subpart, shall maintain records and submit as part of the Notification of Compliance Status specified in § 63.152 of this subpart, measurements, engineering assessments, and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream. Documentation of engineering assessments shall include all data, assumptions, and procedures used for the engineering assessments, as specified in § 63.115(d)(1) of this subpart.

(c) Each owner or operator who elects to demonstrate that a process vent is a Group 2 process vent based on a flow rate less than 0.005 standard cubic meter per minute must submit to the Administrator the flow rate measurement using methods and procedures specified in § 63.115 (a) and (b) of this subpart with the Notification of Compliance Status specified in § 63.152 of this subpart.

(d) Each owner or operator who elects to demonstrate that a process vent is a Group 2 process vent based on organic HAP or TOC concentration less than 50 parts per million by volume must submit to the Administrator an organic HAP or TOC concentration measurement using the methods and procedures specified in § 63.115 (a) and (c) of this subpart with the Notification of Compliance Status specified in § 63.152 of this subpart.

(e) If an owner or operator uses a control or recovery device other than those listed in tables 3 and 4 of this subpart or requests approval to monitor a parameter other than those specified in tables 3 and 4 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit a description of planned reporting and recordkeeping procedures as required under § 63.151(f) or § 63.152(e) of this subpart. The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements as part of the review of the permit application or by other appropriate means.

(f) For each parameter monitored according to tables 3 or 4 of this subpart or paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall establish a range for the parameter that indicates proper operation of the control or recovery device. In order to establish the range, the information required in § 63.152(b) of this subpart shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the operating permit application or amendment.
