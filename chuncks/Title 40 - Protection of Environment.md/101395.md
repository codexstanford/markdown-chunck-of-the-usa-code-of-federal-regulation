####### Stabilizing emission levels.

(e)You may operate the engine to stabilize the emission levels before you test production-line engines. Using good engineering judgment, operate your engines in a way that represents the way production engines will be used. You may operate each engine for no more than the greater of two periods:

(1) 12 hours.

(2) The number of hours you operated your emission-data engine for certifying the engine family (see 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, or the applicable regulations governing how you should prepare your test engine).
