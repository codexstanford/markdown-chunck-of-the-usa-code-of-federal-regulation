###### ยง 1045.145 Are there interim provisions that apply only for a limited time?
####### Continued use of 40 CFR part 91 test data.

(n)You may continue to use test data based on the test procedures that applied for engines built before the requirements of this part started to apply if we allow you to use carryover emission data under ยง 1045.235(d) for your engine family. You may also use those test procedures for production-line testing with any engine family whose certification is based on testing with those procedures. For any EPA testing, we will rely on the procedures described in subpart F of this part, even if you used carryover data based on older test procedures as allowed under this paragraph (n).
