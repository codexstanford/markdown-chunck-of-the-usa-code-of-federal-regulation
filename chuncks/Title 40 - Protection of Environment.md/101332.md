###### ยง 1045.110 How must my engines diagnose malfunctions?
####### Use a malfunction indicator.

(b)The malfunction indicator must be designed such that the operator can readily see or hear it; visible signals may be any color except red. Visible malfunction indicators must display "Check Engine," "Service Engine Soon," or a similar message that we approve. The malfunction indicator must go on under each of the following circumstances:

(1) When a malfunction occurs, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) When the diagnostic system cannot send signals to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) When the engine's ignition is in the "key-on" position before starting or cranking. The malfunction indicator should turn off after engine starting if the system detects no malfunction.
