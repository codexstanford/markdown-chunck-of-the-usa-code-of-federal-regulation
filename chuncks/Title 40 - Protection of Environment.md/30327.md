####### § 63.1216 What are the standards for solid fuel boilers that burn hazardous waste?
######## Emission limits for new sources.

(b)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

(1) For dioxins and furans, either carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (b)(5) of this section;

(2) Mercury in excess of 11 µgm/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(3) For cadmium and lead combined, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, emissions in excess of 180 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium combined, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, emissions in excess of 190 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:

(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(6) For hydrogen chloride and chlorine combined, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, emissions in excess of 73 parts per million by volume, expressed as a chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) For particulate matter, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2 or as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, emissions in excess of 34 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
