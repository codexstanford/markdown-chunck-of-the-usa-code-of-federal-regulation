###### § 63.9 Notification requirements.
####### Initial notifications.

(b)(1)(i) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the owner or operator of an affected source when such source becomes subject to a relevant standard.

(ii) If an area source subsequently becomes a major source that is subject to the emission standard or other requirement, such source shall be subject to the notification requirements of this section. Area sources previously subject to major source requirements that become major sources again are also subject to the notification requirements of this paragraph and must submit the notification according to the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.

(iii) Affected sources that are required under this paragraph to submit an initial notification may use the application for approval of construction or reconstruction under § 63.5(d) of this subpart, if relevant, to fulfill the initial notification requirements of this paragraph.

(2) The owner or operator of an affected source that has an initial startup before the effective date of a relevant standard under this part shall notify the Administrator in writing that the source is subject to the relevant standard. The notification, which shall be submitted not later than 120 calendar days after the effective date of the relevant standard (or within 120 calendar days after the source becomes subject to the relevant standard), shall provide the following information:

(i) The name and address of the owner or operator;

(ii) The address (i.e., physical location) of the affected source;

(iii) An identification of the relevant standard, or other requirement, that is the basis of the notification and the source's compliance date;

(iv) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of operation of the source and an identification of the types of emission points within the affected source subject to the relevant standard and types of hazardous air pollutants emitted; and

(v) A statement of whether the affected source is a major source or an area source.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed major affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:

(i) A notification of intention to construct a new major-emitting affected source, reconstruct a major-emitting affected source, or reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes a major-emitting affected source with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i); and

(ii)-(iv) [Reserved]

(v) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.

(5) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is not required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:

(i) A notification of intention to construct a new affected source, reconstruct an affected source, or reconstruct a source such that the source becomes an affected source, and

(ii) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.

(iii) Unless the owner or operator has requested and received prior permission from the Administrator to submit less than the information in § 63.5(d), the notification must include the information required on the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i).
