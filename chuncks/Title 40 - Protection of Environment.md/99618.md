####### Defeat devices.

(h)You may not equip your engines with a defeat device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that may reasonably be expected in normal operation and use. However, an AECD is not a defeat device if you identify it in your application for certification and any of the following is true:

(1) The conditions of concern were substantially included in the applicable procedure for duty-cycle testing as described in subpart F of this part.

(2) You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or vehicle) damage or accidents. Preventing engine damage includes preventing damage to aftertreatment or other emission-related components.

(3) The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.
