######## Emissions averaging plan.

(j)You must develop an implementation plan for emissions averaging according to the following procedures and requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) You must include the information contained in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (v) of this section in your implementation plan for all the emissions units included in an emissions averaging:

(i) The identification of all existing EGUs in the emissions averaging group, including for each either the applicable HAP emission level or the control technology installed as of 180 days after February 16, 2015, or the date on which you complete the emissions measurements used to support your emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does not require submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan), or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier; and the date on which you are requesting emissions averaging to commence;

(ii) The process weighting parameter (heat input, gross output, or steam generated) that will be monitored for each averaging group;

(iii) The specific control technology or pollution prevention measure to be used for each emission EGU in the averaging group and the date of its installation or application. If the pollution prevention measure reduces or eliminates emissions from multiple EGUs, you must identify each EGU;

(iv) The means of measurement (e.g., CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, manual performance test) of filterable PM, SO, HF, HCl, individual or total non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions in accordance with the requirements in ยง 63.10007 and to be used in the emissions averaging calculations; and

(v) A demonstration that emissions averaging can produce compliance with each of the applicable emission limit(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(2) If, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator requests you to submit the averaging plan for review and approval, you must receive approval before initiating emissions averaging.

(i) The Administrator shall use following criteria in reviewing and approving or disapproving the plan:

(A) Whether the content of the plan includes all of the information specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and

(B) Whether the plan presents information sufficient to determine that compliance will be achieved and maintained.

(ii) The Administrator shall not approve an emissions averaging implementation plan containing any of the following provisions:

(A) Any averaging between emissions of different pollutants or between units located at different facilities; or

(B) The inclusion of any emissions unit other than an existing unit in the same subcategory.
