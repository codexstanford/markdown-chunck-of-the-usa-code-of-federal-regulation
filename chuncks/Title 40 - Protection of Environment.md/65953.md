##### Subpart J - Tank Systems
###### ยง 261.196 Response to leaks or spills and disposition of leaking or unfit-for-use tank systems.
####### e.g.,

(4) If the source of the release was a leak to the environment from a component of a tank system without secondary containment, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material must provide the component of the system from which the leak occurred with secondary containment that satisfies the requirements of ยง 261.193 before it can be returned to service, unless the source of the leak is an aboveground portion of a tank system that can be inspected visually. If the source is an aboveground component that can be inspected visually, the component must be repaired and may be returned to service without secondary containment as long as the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section are satisfied. Additionally, if a leak has occurred in any portion of a tank system component that is not readily accessible for visual inspection (the bottom of an inground or onground tank), the entire component must be provided with secondary containment in accordance with ยง 261.193 of this subpart prior to being returned to use.
