###### ยง 723.250 Polymers.
####### Polymers with number average MW greater than or equal to 1,000 and less than 10,000 daltons (and oligomer content less than 10 percent below MW 500 and less than 25 percent below MW 1,000).

(1)(i) The polymer must have a number average MW greater than or equal to 1,000 and less than 10,000 daltons and contain less than 10 percent oligomeric material below MW 500 and less than 25 percent oligomeric material below MW 1,000.

(ii) The polymer cannot contain reactive functional groups unless it meets one of the following criteria:

(A) The polymer contains only the following reactive functional groups: carboxylic acid groups, aliphatic hydroxyl groups, unconjugated olefinic groups that are considered "ordinary,"(i.e., not specially activated either by being part of a larger functional group, such as a vinyl ether, or by other activating influences, e.g., strongly electron-withdrawing sulfone group with which the olefinic groups interact), butenedioic acid groups, those conjugated olefinic groups contained in naturally-occurring fats, oils, and carboxylic acids, blocked isocyanates (including ketoxime-blocked isocyanates), thiols, unconjugated nitrile groups, and halogens (except that reactive halogen-containing groups such as benzylic or allylichalides cannot be included).
