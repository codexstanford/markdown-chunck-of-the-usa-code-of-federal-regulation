####### Ramped-modal and transient testing.,EF,EF

(2)Develop a separate set of adjustment factors for an entire ramped-modal cycle or transient duty cycle. When measuring, if a regeneration event has started but is not complete when you reach the end of the duty cycle, start the next repeat test as soon as possible, allowing for the time needed to complete emission measurement and installation of new filters for PM measurement; in that caseis the average emission level for the test segments that included regeneration.
