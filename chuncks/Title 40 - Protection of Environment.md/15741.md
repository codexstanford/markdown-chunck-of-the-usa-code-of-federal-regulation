####### ยง 53.52 Leak check test.
######## Overview.

(a)In section 7.4.6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, the sampler is required to include the facility, including components, instruments, operator controls, a written procedure, and other capabilities as necessary, to allow the operator to carry out a leak test of the sampler at a field monitoring site without additional equipment. This test procedure is intended to test the adequacy and effectiveness of the sampler's leak check facility. Because of the variety of potential sampler configurations and leak check procedures possible, some adaptation of this procedure may be necessary to accommodate the specific sampler under test. The test conditions and performance specifications associated with this test are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must meet all test parameters and test specifications to successfully pass this test.
