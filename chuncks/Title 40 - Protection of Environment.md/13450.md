####### Approval

(e)-On April 14, 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a modification to the Lowell maintenance plan approved in paragraph (c) of this section. Massachusetts will not conduct CO monitoring in Lowell, but instead commits to continue to collect and review CO monitoring data from nearby Worcester, MA on an on-going basis. In the event the second highest CO concentration in any calendar year monitored in Worcester reaches 75 percent of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for CO, Massachusetts will, within 9 months of recording such concentrations, re-establish a CO monitoring site in Lowell consistent with EPA citing criteria, and resume analyzing and reporting those data. Massachusetts commits to implement its contingency program in Lowell in the event that a CO violation is monitored at the re-established Lowell monitoring site at any time during the maintenance period. If the Worcester CO monitor measures a violation of either the federal 1-hour or 8-hour NAAQS for CO, contingency measures will be implemented in Lowell as well, until a re-established CO monitor in Lowell shows that the area is in attainment of the CO standard.
