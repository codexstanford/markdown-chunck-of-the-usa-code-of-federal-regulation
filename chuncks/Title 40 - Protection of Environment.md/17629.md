####### i.e.,

(4) For a IGCC electric utility generating unit that coproduces chemicals constructed, reconstructed, or modified after May 3, 2011, the gross useful work performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output from the unit minus electricity used to power the feedwater pumps and any associated gas compressors (air separation unit main compressor, oxygen compressor, and nitrogen compressor) that are associated with power production plus 75 percent of the useful thermal output measured relative to ISO conditions that is not used to generate additional electrical or mechanical output or to enhance the performance of the unit (steam delivered to an industrial process). Auxiliary loads that are associated with power production are determined based on the energy in the coproduced chemicals compared to the energy of the syngas combusted in combustion turbine engine and associated duct burners.
