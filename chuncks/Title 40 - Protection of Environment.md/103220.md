(c)The calculations for a chemical balance involve a system of equations that require iteration. We recommend using a computer to solve this system of equations. You must guess the initial values of up to three quantities: the amount of water in the measured flow,fraction of dilution air in diluted exhaust,and the amount of products on a Cbasis per dry mole of dry measured flow,You may use time-weighted mean values of intake air humidity and dilution air humidity in the chemical balance; as long as your intake air and dilution air humidities remain within tolerances of +/-0.0025 mol/mol of their respective mean values over the test interval. For each emission concentration,and amount of water,you must determine their completely dry concentrations,andYou must also use your fuel mixture's atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio,oxygen-to-carbon ratio,sulfur-to-carbon ratio,and nitrogen-to-carbon ratio,you may optionally account for diesel exhaust fluid (or other fluids injected into the exhaust), if applicable. You may calculateandbased on measured fuel composition or based on measured fuel and diesel exhaust fluid (or other fluids injected into the exhaust) composition together, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. You may alternatively use any combination of default values and measured values as described in paragraph (e) of this section. Use the following steps to complete a chemical balance:
