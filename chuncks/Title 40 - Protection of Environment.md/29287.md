(4) For leaks that were repaired during the reporting period (including delayed repairs), identification of the monitoring location associated with the repaired leak, the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate measured during re-monitoring to verify repair, and the re-monitoring date (the effective date of repair); and

(5) For each delayed repair, identification of the monitoring location associated with the leak for which repair is delayed, the date when the delay of repair began, the date the repair is expected to be completed (if the leak is not repaired during the reporting period), the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate and date of each monitoring event conducted on the delayed repair during the reporting period, and an estimate of the potential total hydrocarbon emissions over the reporting period associated with the delayed repair.
