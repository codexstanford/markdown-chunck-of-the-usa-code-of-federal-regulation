######### Allocations from Indian country new unit set-asides.

(b)For each control period in 2021 and thereafter and for the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units in Indian country within the borders of each State, the Administrator will allocate CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances to the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units as follows:

(1) The CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances will be allocated to the following CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units, except as provided in paragraph (b)(10) of this section:

(i) CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units that are not allocated an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in the notice of data availability issued under § 97.1011(a)(1) and that have deadlines for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) not later than September 30 of the year of the control period; or

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) The Administrator will establish a separate Indian country new unit set-aside for the State for each such control period. Each such Indian country new unit set-aside will be allocated CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in an amount equal to the applicable amount of tons of NOemissions as set forth in § 97.1010(a) and will be allocated additional CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances (if any) in accordance with § 97.1011(c)(5).

(3) The Administrator will determine, for each CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an allocation of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the later of the following control periods and for each subsequent control period:

(i) The control period in 2021; and

(ii) The control period containing the deadline for certification of the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit's monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b).

(4)(i) The allocation to each CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and for each control period described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be an amount equal to the unit's total tons of NOemissions during the control period.

(ii) The Administrator will adjust the allocation amount in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (b)(5) through (7) and (12) of this section.

(5) The Administrator will calculate the sum of the allocation amounts of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances determined for all such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in Indian country within the borders of the State for such control period.

(6) If the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in the Indian country new unit set-aside for the State for such control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances determined for each such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.

(7) If the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in the Indian country new unit set-aside for the State for such control period is less than the sum under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate to each such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit the amount of the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section for the unit, multiplied by the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in the Indian country new unit set-aside for such control period, divided by the sum under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, and rounded to the nearest allowance.

(8) [Reserved]

(9) [Reserved]

(10) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraphs (b)(2) through (7) and (12) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances remain in the Indian country new unit set-aside for the State for such control period, the Administrator will:

(i) Transfer such unallocated CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances to the new unit set-aside for the State for such control period; or

(ii) If the State has a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(11) or (12) of this chapter covering such control period, include such unallocated CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances in the portion of the State NOOzone Season Group 3 trading budget that may be allocated for such control period in accordance with such SIP revision.

(11) The Administrator will notify the public, through the promulgation of the notices of data availability described in § 97.1011(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (v), of the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances allocated under paragraphs (b)(2) through (7), (10), and (12) of this section for such control period to each CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 unit eligible for such allocation.

(12) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (11) of this section, if the calculations of allocations from an Indian country new unit set-aside for a control period in a given year under paragraph (b)(7) of this section would otherwise result in total allocations from such Indian country new unit set-aside unequal to the total amount of such Indian country new unit set-aside, then the Administrator will adjust the results of such calculations as follows. The Administrator will list the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 units in descending order based on such units' allocation amounts under paragraph (b)(7) of this section and, in cases of equal allocation amounts, in alphabetical order of the relevant sources' names and numerical order of the relevant units' identification numbers, and will adjust each unit's allocation amount under such paragraph upward or downward by one CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance (but not below zero) in the order in which the units are listed, and will repeat this adjustment process as necessary, until the total allocations from such Indian country new unit set-aside equal the total amount of such Indian country new unit set-aside.
