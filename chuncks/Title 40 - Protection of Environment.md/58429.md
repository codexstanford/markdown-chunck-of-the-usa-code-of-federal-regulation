####### Product as diluted for use.

(b)If the product labeling bears directions for dilution with water prior to use, the label may also include a statement describing how the first aid measures may be modified for the diluted product. Such a statement must reflect the Toxicity Category(ies) of the diluted product, based upon data for the route of exposure (or calculations if appropriate). If the labeling provides for a range of use dilutions, only that use dilution representing the highest concentration allowed by labeling may be used as the basis for a statement pertaining to the diluted product. The statement for a diluted product may not substitute for the statement for the concentrate, but augments the information provided for the concentrate.
