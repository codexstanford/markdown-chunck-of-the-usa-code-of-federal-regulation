####### ยง 63.1209 What are the monitoring requirements?
######## Compliance with feedrate limits.

(4)To comply with the applicable feedrate limits of this section, you must monitor and record feedrates as follows:

(i) Determine and record the value of the parameter for each feedstream by sampling and analysis or other method;

(ii) Determine and record the mass or volume flowrate of each feedstream by a CMS. If you determine flowrate of a feedstream by volume, you must determine and record the density of the feedstream by sampling and analysis (unless you report the constituent concentration in units of weight per unit volume (e.g., mg/l)); and

(iii) Calculate and record the mass feedrate of the parameter per unit time.
