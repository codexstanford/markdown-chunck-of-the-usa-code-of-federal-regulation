####### Exposed gasket surface area

means the surface area of the gasket inside the fuel tank that is exposed to fuel or fuel vapor. For the purposes of calculating exposed surface area of a gasket, the thickness of the gasket and the outside dimension of the opening being sealed are used. Gasket overhang into the fuel tank should be ignored for the purpose of this calculation.
