###### ยง 725.470 EPA review of the Tier II exemption request.
####### Determination that the microorganism is ineligible for a Tier II review.

(d)(1) EPA may determine that the manufacturer or importer is not eligible for Tier II review, because the microorganism does not meet the criteria under ยง 725.428 or the Administrator, or a designee, decides that there is insufficient information to determine that the conditions of manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of the microorganism as described in the request will not present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.

(2) If the Agency makes this determination, the Administrator, or a designee will notify the manufacturer or importer by telephone, followed by a letter, that the request has been denied. The letter will explain reasons for the denial.
