(a)(1). The test sequence shown in Figure 1 of 40 CFR 1066.801 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth. The full three- diurnal sequence depicted in Figure 1 of 40 CFR 1066.801 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters during the exhaust emission test. Sections 86.132-96, 86.133-96, and 86.138-96 describe the separate specifications of the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence.
