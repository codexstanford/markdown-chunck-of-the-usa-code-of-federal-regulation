####### Loading at negative pressure.

(d)Owners or operators of a source complying with ยง 63.563(a)(4)(iv) that load vessels at less than atmospheric pressure (i.e., negative gauge pressure) shall measure and record the loading pressure. The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a recording pressure measurement device (magnehelic gauge or equivalent device) and an audible and visible alarm system that is activated when the pressure vacuum specified in ยง 63.563(a)(4)(iv) is not attained. The owner or operator shall place the alarm system so that it can be seen and heard where cargo transfer is controlled. The owner or operator shall verify the accuracy of the pressure device once each calendar year with a reference pressure monitor (traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards or an independent pressure measurement device dedicated for this purpose).
