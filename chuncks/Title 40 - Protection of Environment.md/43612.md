####### Evaluation of Results.

(2)(i) Results shall be evaluated in terms of the extent of change in the amount of GFAP as a function of treatment and dose. GFAP assays (of any brain region) from a minimum of 6 samples typically will result in a standard error of the mean of +/-5 percent. In this case, a chemically-induced increase in GFAP of 115 percent of control is likely to be statistically significant.

(ii) The results of this assay shall be compared to and evaluated with any relevant behavioral and histopathological data.
