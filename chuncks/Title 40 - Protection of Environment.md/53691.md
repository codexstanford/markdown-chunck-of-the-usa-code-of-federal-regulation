(viii) Applicants must collect samples of effluent and analyze such samples for pollutants in accordance with analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136 unless an alternative is specified in the existing NPDES permit. When analysis of pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, residual chlorine, oil and grease, fecal coliform (including), or volatile organics is required in paragraphs (j)(4)(ii) through (iv) of this section, grab samples must be collected for those pollutants. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be used. For a composite sample, only one analysis of the composite of aliquots is required.

(ix) The effluent monitoring data provided must include at least the following information for each parameter:

(A) Maximum daily discharge, expressed as concentration or mass, based upon actual sample values;

(B) Average daily discharge for all samples, expressed as concentration or mass, and the number of samples used to obtain this value;

(C) The analytical method used; and

(D) The threshold level (i.e., method detection limit, minimum level, or other designated method endpoints) for the analytical method used.

(x) Unless otherwise required by the Director, metals must be reported as total recoverable.
