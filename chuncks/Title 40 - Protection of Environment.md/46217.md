####### Malfunction criteria for the thermostat.

(ii)(A) The OBD system must detect a thermostat malfunction if, within the manufacturer specified time interval following engine start, any of the following conditions occur: The coolant temperature does not reach the highest temperature required by the OBD system to enable other diagnostics; and, the coolant temperature does not reach a warmed-up temperature within 20 degrees Fahrenheit of the manufacturer's nominal thermostat regulating temperature. For the second of these two conditions, the manufacturer may use a lower temperature for this criterion if either the manufacturer can demonstrate that the fuel, spark timing, and/or other coolant temperature-based modification to the engine control strategies would not cause an emissions increase greater than or equal to 50 percent of any of the applicable emissions standards; or, ambient air temperature is between 20 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 degrees Fahrenheit in which case, upon Administrator approval, the minimum coolant temperature required to be reached may be decreased based on the ambient air temperature.

(B) With Administrator approval, the manufacturer may use alternative malfunction criteria to those of paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of this section and/or alternative monitoring conditions to those of paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this section that are a function of temperature at engine start on engines that do not reach the temperatures specified in the malfunction criteria when the thermostat is functioning properly. To do so, the manufacturer is required to submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that a properly operating system does not reach the specified temperatures and that the possibility is minimized for cooling system malfunctions to go undetected thus disabling other OBD monitors.

(C) The manufacturer may request Administrator approval to forego monitoring of the thermostat if the manufacturer can demonstrate that a malfunctioning thermostat cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition nor cause any disablement of other OBD monitors.
