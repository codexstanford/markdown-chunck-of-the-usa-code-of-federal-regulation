####### Experimental use permit review

(f)means review of an application for a permit pursuant to section 5 of FIFRA to apply a limited quantity of a pesticide in order to accumulate information necessary to register the pesticide. The application may be for a new chemical or for a new use of an old chemical. The fee applies to such experimental uses of a single unregistered active ingredient (no limit on the number of other active ingredients, in a tank mix, already registered for the crops involved) and no more than three crops. This fee does not apply to experimental use permits required for small-scale field testing of microbial pest control agents (40 CFR 172.3).
