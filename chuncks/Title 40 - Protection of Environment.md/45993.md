###### § 86.005-10 Emission standards for 2005 and later model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles.
####### Idle carbon monoxide.

(C)For all Otto-cycle HDEs utilizing aftertreatment technology, and not certified to the onboard diagnostics requirements of § 86.005-17: 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle.

(2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (f) of this section refer to the exhaust emitted over the operating schedule set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of appendix I to this part, and measured and calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart N or P of this part.

(3)(i) A manufacturer may certify one or more Otto-cycle HDE configurations intended for use in all vehicles to the emission standard set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section: Provided, that the total model year sales of such configuration(s), segregated by fuel type, being certified to the emission standard in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section represent no more than five percent of total model year sales of each fuel type Otto-cycle HDE intended for use in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 pounds by the manufacturer.

(ii) The configurations certified to the emission standards of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall still be required to meet the evaporative emission standards set forth in § 86.099-10(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i).

(4) The manufacturer may exempt 2005 model year HDE engine families whose model year begins before July, 31, 2004 from the requirements in this paragraph (a). Exempted engine families shall be subject to the requirements in § 86.099-10.

(5) For certification purposes, where the applicable California evaporative emission standard is as stringent or more stringent than the applicable federal evaporative emission standard, the Administrator may accept California certification test data indicating compliance with the California standard to demonstrate compliance with the appropriate federal certification evaporative emission standard. The Administrator may require the manufacturer to provide comparative test data which clearly demonstrates that a vehicle meeting the California evaporative standard (when tested under California test conditions/test procedures) will also meet the appropriate federal evaporative emission standard when tested under federal test conditions/test procedures described in this part 86.

(b) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.099-10.

(c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any new 1998 or later model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine.

(d) Every manufacturer of new motor vehicle engines subject to the standards prescribed in this section shall, prior to taking any of the actions specified in section 203(a)(1) of the Act, test or cause to be tested motor vehicle engines in accordance with applicable procedures in subpart N or P of this part to ascertain that such test engines meet the requirements of this section.

(e) [Reserved]. For guidance see § 86.099-10.
