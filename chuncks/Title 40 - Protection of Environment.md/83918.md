####### Protection in the workplace.

(i)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), (b), and (c). Respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50. The following NIOSH-approved respirators meet the minimum requirement for ยง 721.63(a)(4): Air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; supplied air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece. Because the substance is a dermal sensitizer and irritates mucous membranes, half-face respirators do not provide adequate protection.
