######## Batch process vent

means a vent from a CMPU or vents from multiple CMPUs within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Batch process vents include vents from batch operations and vents with intermittent flow from continuous operations that are not combined with any stream that originated as a continuous gas stream from the same continuousprocess. Examples of batch process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. The following are not batch process vents for the purposes of this subpart:

(1) Continuous process vents;

(2) Bottoms receivers;

(3) Surge control vessels;

(4) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s);

(5) A gas stream routed to other processes for reaction or other use in another process (i.e., for chemical value as a product, isolated intermediate, byproduct, or coproduct, or for heat value).

(6) Vents on storage tanks or wastewater systems;

(7) Drums, pails, and totes; and

(8) Emission streams from emission episodes that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP are not part of any batch process vent. The HAP concentration may be determined using any of the following: process knowledge, an engineering assessment, or test data.
