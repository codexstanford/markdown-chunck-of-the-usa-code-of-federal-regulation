######## Outlet concentration correction for combustion devices.

(3)When ยง 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, the requirements in either paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (g)(3)(ii) of this section apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(i) You must correct the concentration in the gas stream at the outlet of the combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental gases, as defined in ยง 63.2550, to the vent stream, or;

(ii) You must correct the measured concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 of ยง 63.2460; you may use process knowledge and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.
