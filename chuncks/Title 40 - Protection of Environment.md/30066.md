###### Monitoring and Compliance Provisions
####### § 63.1209 What are the monitoring requirements?
######## Cement kilns under § 63.1220.

(B)Except as provided by paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (a)(1)(v) of the section and unless your source is equipped with a bag leak detection system under § 63.1206(c)(8) or a particulate matter detection system under § 63.1206(c)(9), you must use a COMS to demonstrate and monitor compliance with the opacity standard under §§ 63.1220(a)(7) and (b)(7) at each point where emissions are vented from these affected sources including the bypass stack of a preheater or preheater/precalciner kiln with dual stacks.

(C) You must maintain and operate each COMS in accordance with the requirements of § 63.8(c) except for the requirements under § 63.8(c)(3). The requirements of § 63.1211(c) shall be complied with instead of § 63.8(c)(3); and

(D) Compliance is based on a six-minute block average.

(iii) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a particulate matter CEMS to demonstrate and monitor compliance with the particulate matter standards under this subpart. However, compliance with the requirements in this section to install, calibrate, maintain and operate the PM CEMS is not required until such time that the Agency promulgates all performance specifications and operational requirements applicable to PM CEMS.

(iv) If you operate a cement kiln subject to the provisions of this subpart and use a fabric filter with multiple stacks or an electrostatic precipitator with multiple stacks, you may, in lieu of installing the COMS required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, comply with the opacity standard in accordance with the procedures of Method 9 to part 60 of this chapter:

(A) You must conduct the Method 9 test while the affected source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur within the day;

(B) The duration of the Method 9 test shall be at least 30 minutes each day;

(C) You must use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the average opacity for each six-minute block period during the test; and

(D) To remain in compliance, all six-minute block averages must not exceed the opacity standard.

(v) If you operate a cement kiln subject to the provisions of this subpart and use a particulate matter control device that exhausts through a monovent, or if the use of a COMS in accordance with the installation specification of Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter is not feasible, you may, in lieu of installing the COMS required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, comply with the opacity standard in accordance with the procedures of Method 9 to part 60 of this chapter:

(A) You must conduct the Method 9 test while the affected source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur within the day;

(B) The duration of the Method 9 test shall be at least 30 minutes each day;

(C) You must use the Method 9 procedures to monitor and record the average opacity for each six-minute block period during the test; and

(D) To remain in compliance, all six-minute block averages must not exceed the opacity standard.
