## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency

##### Appendix C to Part 191 - Guidance for Implementation of Subpart B
###### Compliance with §§ 191.15 and 191.16.

When the uncertainties in undisturbed performance of a disposal system are considered, the implementing agencies need not require that a very large percentage of the range of estimated radiation exposures or radionuclide concentrations fall below limits established in §§ 191.15 and 191.16, respectively. The Agency assumes that compliance can be determined based upon "best estimate" predictions (e.g., the mean or the median of the appropriate distribution, whichever is higher).
