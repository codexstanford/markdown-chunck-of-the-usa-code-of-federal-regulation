###### ยง 1065.170 Batch sampling for gaseous and PM constituents.
####### Gaseous sample storage media.

(b)Store gas volumes in sufficiently clean containers that minimally off-gas or allow permeation of gases. Use good engineering judgment to determine acceptable thresholds of storage media cleanliness and permeation. To clean a container, you may repeatedly purge and evacuate a container and you may heat it. Use a flexible container (such as a bag) within a temperature-controlled environment, or use a temperature controlled rigid container that is initially evacuated or has a volume that can be displaced, such as a piston and cylinder arrangement. Use containers meeting the specifications in the Table 1 of this section, noting that you may request to use other container materials under ยง 1065.10. Sample temperatures must stay within the following ranges for each container material:

(1) Up to 40 &#xB0;C for Tedlarand Kynar..

(2) (191 +/-11) &#xB0;C for Teflonand 300 series stainless steel used with measuring THC or NMHC from compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, and four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW. For all other engines and pollutants, these materials may be used for sample temperatures up to 202 &#xB0;C.
