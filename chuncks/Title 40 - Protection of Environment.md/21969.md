###### Five-hole spherical probe.

6.1.2This type of probe consists of five pressure taps in a spherical sensing head. As with the prism-shaped probe, the pressure taps are numbered 1 through 5, with the pressures measured at each hole referred to as P, P, P, P, and P, respectively. However, the Pand Ppressure taps are in the reverse location from their respective positions on the prism-shaped probe head. The differential pressure P-Pis used to yaw null the probe and determine the yaw angle; the differential pressure P-Pis a function of pitch angle; and the differential pressure P-Pis a function of total velocity. A diagram of a typical spherical probe sensing head is presented in Figure 2F-4. Typical probe dimensions are indicated in the illustration.
