####### Determination of attainment.

(f)Effective November 17, 2008 EPA has determined that the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration or 5% increment of progress plan, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.

(g) Approval. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El Paso County on January 20, 2006. The area is designated unclassifiable/attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. EPA determined this request for El Paso County was complete on June 13, 2006. The maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act and is consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El Paso County on January 15, 2009.
