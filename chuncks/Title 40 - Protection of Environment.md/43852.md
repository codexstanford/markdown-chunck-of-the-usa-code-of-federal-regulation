###### ยง 80.1426 How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel?
####### Method B.

(B)Vshall be calculated according to the following formula:

(ii) The D code that shall be used in the RINs generated to represent partially renewable transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel shall be the D code specified in Table 1 to this section, or a D code as approved by the Administrator, which corresponds to the pathway that describes a producer's operations. In determining the appropriate pathway, the contribution of non-renewable feedstocks to the production of partially renewable fuel shall be ignored.

(iii) In determining the RIN volume Vaccording to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) or (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the equivalence value used to determine Vwhich is calculated according to ยง 80.1415 shall use a value of 1.0 to represent R, the renewable content of the renewable fuel.

(iv) RIN-generating parties must calculate RIN volume Vfor co-processed fuels produced from a biointermediate as described in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section and calculate the renewable fraction of a fuel R using one of the following:

(A) Method B of ASTM D6866 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 80.1468) as described in paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section.

(B) If the renewable content of the co-processed fuel is 10 percent or greater, Method C of ASTM D6866 as described in paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section.

(C) Any other EPA-approved method under paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section.
