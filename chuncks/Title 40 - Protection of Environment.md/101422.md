####### Special and alternate procedures.

(g)If you are unable to run the duty cycle specified in this part for your engine (such as with constant-speed engines), use an alternate test cycle that will result in a cycle-weighted emission measurement equivalent to the expected average in-use emissions. This cycle must be approved under 40 CFR 1065.10. You may use other special or alternate procedures to the extent we allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.
