######## Wet scrubber

means an air pollution control device that removes particulate matter and acid gases from the waste gas stream of stationary sources. The pollutants are removed primarily through the impaction, diffusion, interception and/or absorption of the pollutant onto droplets of liquid. Wet scrubbers include venturi scrubbers, marble bed scrubbers, or impingement scrubbers. For purposes of this subpart, wet scrubbers do not include dynamic wet scrubbers.
