###### Continuation and withdrawal of authorization,Effect of authorization.

(f)-(1)(i) Once a POTW has received authorization to grant removal credits for a particular pollutant regulated in a categorical Pretreatment Standard it may automatically extend that removal credit to the same pollutant when it is regulated in other categorical standards, unless granting the removal credit will cause the POTW to violate the sludge requirements identified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section or its NPDES permit limits and conditions as required by paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section. If a POTW elects at a later time to extend removal credits to a certain categorical Pretreatment Standard, industrial subcategory or one or more Industrial Users that initially were not granted removal credits, it must notify the Approval Authority.
