###### § 51.117 Additional provisions for lead.
####### Special modeling provisions.

(c)(1) For urbanized areas with measured lead concentrations in excess of 4.0 µg/m, quarterly mean measured since January 1, 1974, the plan must employ the modified rollback model for the demonstration of attainment as a minimum, but may use an atmospheric dispersion model if desired, consistent with requirements contained in § 51.112(a). If a proportional model is used, the air quality data should be the same year as the emissions inventory required under the paragraph e.

(2) For each point source listed in § 51.117(a), that plan must employ an atmospheric dispersion model for demonstration of attainment, consistent with requirements contained in § 51.112(a).

(3) For each area in the vicinity of an air quality monitor that has recorded lead concentrations in excess of the lead national standard concentration, the plan must employ the modified rollback model as a minimum, but may use an atmospheric dispersion model if desired for the demonstration of attainment, consistent with requirements contained in § 51.112(a).
