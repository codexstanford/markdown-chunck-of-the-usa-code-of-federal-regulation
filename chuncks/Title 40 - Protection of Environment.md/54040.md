###### ยง 122.38 Public notification requirements for CSO discharges to the Great Lakes Basin.
####### Notification of the public.,e.g.,

(3)(i) As soon as possible, but no later than four (4) hours after becoming aware by monitoring, modeling or other means that a CSO discharge has occurred, the Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee shall provide public notification of CSO discharges. The Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee shall provide public notification of CSO discharges electronically, such as by text, email, social media alerts to subscribers or by posting a notice on its public access website, and, if appropriate, by other means (newspaper, radio, television). If a permittee's public notification plan identifies circumstances and physical action needed to limit the public health impacts of the CSO discharge by controlling the CSO discharge (including continuing to implement its existing practice of conducting inspections of CSO discharge points during the discharge), and all available staff are required to complete this action, the four-hour notification window will commence upon completion of that action.

(ii) At a minimum, the notice shall include:

(A) The water body that received the discharge(s);

(B) The location of the discharge(s) and identification of the public access areas potentially impacted by the discharge. Where CSO discharges from the same system occur at multiple locations during the same precipitation-related event, the Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee may provide a description of the area in the waterbody where discharges are occurring and identification of the public access areas potentially impacted by the discharge, and the permittee is not required to identify the specific location of each discharge;

(C) The date(s) and time(s) that the discharge(s) commenced or the time the permittee became aware of the discharge(s); and

(D) Whether, at the time of the notification, the discharge(s) is continuing or has ended. If the discharge(s) has ended, the approximate time that the discharge(s) ended.

(iii) Within seven (7) days after becoming aware by monitoring, modeling or other means that the CSO discharge(s) has ended, the Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee shall update the electronic notice with the following information unless the information had been provided in an earlier notice:

(A) The measured or estimated volume of the discharge(s). Where CSO discharges from the same system occur at multiple locations during the same precipitation-related event, the Great Lakes Basin CSO permittee may provide an estimate of the cumulative volume discharged to a given waterbody; and

(B) The approximate time that the discharge(s) ended, unless this information was provided in an earlier notice.
