###### ยง 93.158 Criteria for determining conformity of general Federal actions.

(a) An action required under ยง 93.153 to have a conformity determination for a specific pollutant, will be determined to conform to the applicable SIP if, for each pollutant that exceeds the rates in ยง 93.153(b), or otherwise requires a conformity determination due to the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action, the action meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and meets any of the following requirements:

(1) For any criteria pollutant or precursor, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are specifically identified and accounted for in the applicable SIP's attainment or maintenance demonstration or reasonable further progress milestone or in a facility-wide emission budget included in a SIP in accordance with ยง 93.161;

(2) For precursors of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are fully offset within the same nonattainment or maintenance area (or nearby area of equal or higher classification provided the emissions from that area contribute to the violations, or have contributed to violations in the past, in the area with the Federal action) through a revision to the applicable SIP or a similarly enforceable measure that effects emissions reductions so that there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;

(3) For any directly-emitted criteria pollutant, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meets the requirements:

(i) Specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on areawide air quality modeling analysis and local air quality modeling analysis; or

(ii) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section and, for local air quality modeling analysis, the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section;

(4) For CO or directly emitted PM-

(i) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on local air quality modeling analysis; or

(ii) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is appropriate and that a local air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on areawide modeling, or meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section; or

(5) For ozone or nitrogen dioxide, and for purposes of paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section, each portion of the action or the action as a whole meets any of the following requirements:

(i) Where EPA has approved a revision to the applicable implementation plan after the area was designated as nonattainment and the State or Tribe makes a determination as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section or where the State or Tribe makes a commitment as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section:

(A) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or portion thereof) is determined and documented by the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would not exceed the emissions budgets specified in the applicable SIP;

(B) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or portion thereof) is determined by the State agency responsible for the applicable SIP to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would exceed an emissions budget specified in the applicable SIP and the State Governor or the Governor's designee for SIP actions makes a written commitment to EPA which includes the following:
