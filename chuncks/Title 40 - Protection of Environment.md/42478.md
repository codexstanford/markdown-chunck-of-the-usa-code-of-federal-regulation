###### ยง 75.10 General operating requirements.
####### Minimum recording and recordkeeping requirements.
######## Moisture correction.

(b)Where SOconcentration is measured on a dry basis, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Report the appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value for each unit operating hour, selected from among the following: 3.0%, for anthracite coal; 6.0% for bituminous coal; 8.0% for sub-bituminous coal; 11.0% for lignite coal; 13.0% for wood and 14.0% for natural gas (boilers, only); or

(2) Install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases, in order to correct the measured hourly volumetric flow rates for moisture when calculating SOmass emissions (in lb/hr) using the procedures in appendix F to this part. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: a continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring Oboth on a wet basis and on a dry basis; or a stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table, i.e., a psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only). The moisture monitoring system shall include as a component the automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) for recording and reporting both the raw data (e.g., hourly average wet-and dry-basis Ovalues) and the hourly average values of the stack gas moisture content derived from those data. When a moisture look-up table is used, the moisture monitoring system shall be represented as a single component, the certified DAHS, in the monitoring plan for the unit or common stack.
