(i)(A) Long-Term Strategy Review and Revision of Colorado's State Implementation Plan for Class I Visibility Protection Part I: Hayden Station Requirements, as follows: Section VI., effective on August 15, 1996.

(80) On July 11, 1994, July 13, 1994, September 29, 1995, and December 22, 1995, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to the Colorado State Implementation Plan (SIP) to satisfy those CO nonattainment area SIP requirements for Denver and Longmont, Colorado due to be submitted by November 15, 1992, and further revisions to the SIP to shorten the effective period of the oxygenated fuels program. EPA is not taking action on the SIP provision submitted on July 11, 1994 that calls for a prohibition of the re-registration of abandoned and impounded vehicles.
