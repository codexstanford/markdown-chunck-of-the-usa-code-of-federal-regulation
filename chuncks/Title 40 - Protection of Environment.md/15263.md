####### Determination of attainment by the attainment date.

(oo)Effective August 30, 2021. Effective August 30, 2021. On February 8, 2019, the EPA determined the Sheboygan County, WI, area attained the revoked 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the attainment date of June 15, 2010. On July 15, 2019, the EPA revised the designation for the Sheboygan County, WI, area for the revoked 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, by splitting the original full-county area into the separate Inland Sheboygan County, WI, and Shoreline Sheboygan County, WI, areas. On July 10, 2020, EPA redesignated both the Inland Sheboygan County, WI, nonattainment area [85 FR 41400] and the Shoreline Sheboygan County, WI, nonattainment area [85 FR 41405] to attainment for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. Therefore, under 40 CFR 51.1105(b)(1), the areas are no longer subject to the anti-backsliding obligations for the revoked 1997 ozone NAAQS under 40 CFR 51.1105(a)(1).
