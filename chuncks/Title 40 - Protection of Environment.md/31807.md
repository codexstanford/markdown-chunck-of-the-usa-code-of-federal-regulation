() If the owner or operator elects to use other monitoring prior to the periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.

(8) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the following practices where practicable:

(i) Tightening of bonnet bolts,

(ii) Replacement of bonnet bolts,

(iii) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and

(iv) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.

(9) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves in organic HAP service in the affected source is exempt from the requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in organic HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with paragraph (e)(4)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
