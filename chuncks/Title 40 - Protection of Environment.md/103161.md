(2) To calculate the molar flow rate through one venturi or a combination of venturis, you may use its respective mean,, and other constants you determined according to ยง 1065.640 and calculate its molar flow rateduring an emission test. Note that if you follow the permissible ranges of dilution air dewpoint versus calibration air dewpoint in Table 3 of ยง 1065.640, you may setandequal to 1. Calculateas follows:
