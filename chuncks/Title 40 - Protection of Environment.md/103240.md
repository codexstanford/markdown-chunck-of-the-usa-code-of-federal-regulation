###### ยง 1065.655 Chemical balances of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust.
####### Calculated raw exhaust molar flow rate from measured intake air molar flow rate, dilute exhaust molar flow rate, and dilute chemical balance.,[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]

(g)You may calculate the raw exhaust molar flow rate,, based on the measured intake air molar flow rate,, the measured dilute exhaust molar flow rate,, and the values calculated using the chemical balance in paragraph (c) of this section. Note that the chemical balance must be based on dilute exhaust gas concentrations. For continuous-flow calculations, solve for the chemical balance in paragraph (c) of this section at the same frequency that you update and recordand. This calculatedmay be used for the PM dilution ratio verification in ยง 1065.546; the calculation of dilution air molar flow rate in the background correction in ยง 1065.667; and the calculation of mass of emissions in ยง 1065.650(c) for species that are measured in the raw exhaust.
