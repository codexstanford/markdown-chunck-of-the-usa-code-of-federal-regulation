###### ยง 180.41 Crop group tables.

(a) The tables in this section are to be used in conjunction with ยง 180.40 to establish crop group tolerances.

(b) Commodities not listed are not considered as included in the groups for the purposes of paragraph (b), and individual tolerances must be established. Miscellaneous commodities intentionally not included in any group include globe artichoke, hops, peanut, and water chestnut.

(c) Each group is identified by a group name and consists of a list of representative commodities followed by a list of all commodity members for the group. If the group includes subgroups, each subgroup lists the subgroup name, the representative commodity or commodities, and the member commodities for the subgroup. Subgroups, which are a subset of their associated crop group, are established for some but not all crops groups.
