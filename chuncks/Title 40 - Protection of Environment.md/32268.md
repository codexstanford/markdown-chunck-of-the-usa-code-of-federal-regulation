####### Percent oxygen correction for combustion control devices.

(c)If the control device is a combustion device, total organic HAP concentrations shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions. The integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the actual oxygen concentration (%0). The samples shall be taken during the same time that the total organic HAP samples are taken. The concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen (C) shall be computed using Equation 6 of this section:
