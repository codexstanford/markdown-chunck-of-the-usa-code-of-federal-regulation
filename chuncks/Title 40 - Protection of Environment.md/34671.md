######## Determine the density of each material.,see,see

(c)Determine the density of each liquid coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month from test results using ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM D2111-10 (Reapproved 2015) (both incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If you are including powder coatings in the compliance determination, determine the density of powder coatings, using ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), or information from the supplier. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM D2111-10 (Reapproved 2015) test results and other such information sources, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct. If you purchase materials or monitor consumption by weight instead of volume, you do not need to determine material density. Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, 1C, and 2 of this section.
