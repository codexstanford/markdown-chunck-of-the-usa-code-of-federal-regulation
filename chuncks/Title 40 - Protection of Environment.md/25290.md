####### Construct a major source

means:

(1) To fabricate, erect, or install at any greenfield site a stationary source or group of stationary sources which is located within a contiguous area and under common control and which emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP's or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, or

(2) To fabricate, erect, or install at any developed site a new process or production unit which in and of itself emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP, unless the process or production unit satisfies criteria in paragraphs (2) (i) through (vi) of this definition.

(i) All HAP emitted by the process or production unit that would otherwise be controlled under the requirements of this subpart will be controlled by emission control equipment which was previously installed at the same site as the process or production unit;

(ii) (A) The permitting authority has determined within a period of 5 years prior to the fabrication, erection, or installation of the process or production unit that the existing emission control equipment represented best available control technology (BACT), lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) under 40 CFR part 51 or 52, toxics-best available control technology (T-BACT), or MACT based on State air toxic rules for the category of pollutants which includes those HAP's to be emitted by the process or production unit; or

(B) The permitting authority determines that the control of HAP emissions provided by the existing equipment will be equivalent to that level of control currently achieved by other well-controlled similar sources (i.e., equivalent to the level of control that would be provided by a current BACT, LAER, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination);

(iii) The permitting authority determines that the percent control efficiency for emissions of HAP from all sources to be controlled by the existing control equipment will be equivalent to the percent control efficiency provided by the control equipment prior to the inclusion of the new process or production unit;

(iv) The permitting authority has provided notice and an opportunity for public comment concerning its determination that criteria in paragraphs (2)(i), (2)(ii), and (2)(iii) of this definition apply and concerning the continued adequacy of any prior LAER, BATC, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination;

(v) If any commenter has asserted that a prior LAER, BACT, T-BACT, or State air toxic rule MACT determination is no longer adequate, the permitting authority has determined that the level of control required by that prior determination remains adequate; and

(vi) Any emission limitations, work practice requirements, or other terms and conditions upon which the above determinations by the permitting authority are applicable requirements under section 504(a) and either have been incorporated into any existing title V permit for the affected facility or will be incorporated into such permit upon issuance.
