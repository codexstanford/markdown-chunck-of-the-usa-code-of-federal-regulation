###### ยง 798.5955 Heritable translocation test in drosophila melanogaster.
####### Test method,Principle.

(d)-(1)The method is based on the principle that balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations can be induced by chemicals in the germ cells of treated flies and that these translocations are detected in the Fprogeny using genetic markers (mutations). Different mutations may be used as genetic markers and two or more of the four chromosomes may be genetically marked for inclusion in this test.
