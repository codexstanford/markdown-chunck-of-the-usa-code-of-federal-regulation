####### N-,N-,N-,N-

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of glyphosate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed below resulting from the application of glyphosate, the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate, the ethanolamine salt of glyphosate, the dimethylamine salt of glyphosate, the ammonium salt of glyphosate, and the potassium salt of glyphosate. Compliance with the following tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only glyphosate ((phosphonomethyl)glycine) and its metaboliteacetyl-glyphosate (acetyl-(phosphonomethyl)glycine; calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of glyphosate).
