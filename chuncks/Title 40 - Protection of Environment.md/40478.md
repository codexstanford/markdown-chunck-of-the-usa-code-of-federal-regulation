####### Major change to test method

means a modification to a federally enforceable test method that uses "unproven technology or procedures" (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required test method is unsuitable). A major change to a test method may be site-specific or may apply to one or more source categories and will almost always set a national precedent. In order to be approved, a major change must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A). Examples of major changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:

(1) Use of an unproven analytical finish;

(2) Use of a method developed to fill a test method gap;

(3) Use of a new test method developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation in this part; and

(4) Combining two or more sampling/analytical methods (at least one unproven) into one for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.
