###### Applicability
####### ยง 60.1045 Are there different subcategories of small municipal waste combustion units within this subpart?
######## Class II Units.

(2)Class II units are small municipal waste combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of "municipal waste combustion plant capacity" in ยง 60.1465 for specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)

(b) The requirements for Class I and Class II units are identical except for two items:

(1) Class I units have a nitrogen oxides emission limit. Class II units do not have a nitrogen oxides emission limit (see table 1 of this subpart). Additionally, Class I units have continuous emission monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for nitrogen oxides.

(2) Class II units are eligible for the reduced testing option provided in ยง 60.1305.
