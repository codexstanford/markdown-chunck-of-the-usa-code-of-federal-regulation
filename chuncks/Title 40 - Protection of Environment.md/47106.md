####### General.

(a)(1)The exhaust gas sampling system is designed to measure the true mass emissions of vehicle exhaust. In the CVS concept of measuring mass emissions, two conditions must be satisfied: the total volume of the mixture of exhaust and dilution air must be measured and a continuously proportioned volume of sample must be collected for analysis. Mass emissions are determined from the sample concentration and totalized flow over the test period.
