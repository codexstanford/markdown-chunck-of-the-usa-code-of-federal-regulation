###### § 63.804 Compliance procedures and monitoring requirements.

(a) The owner or operator of an existing affected source subject to § 63.802(a)(1) shall comply with those provisions using any of the methods presented in § 63.804 (a)(1) through (a)(4).

(1) Calculate the average VHAP content for all finishing materials used at the facility using Equation 1, and maintain a value of E no greater than 1.0;

(2) Use compliant finishing materials according to the following criteria:

(i) Demonstrate that each stain, sealer, and topcoat has a VHAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and each thinner contains no more than 10.0 percent VHAP by weight by maintaining certified product data sheets for each coating and thinner;

(ii) Demonstrate that each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is purchased pre-made, that is, it is not formulated onsite by thinning another finishing material, has a VHAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and each thinner contains no more than 10.0 percent VHAP by weight by maintaining certified product data sheets for each coating and thinner; and

(iii) Demonstrate that each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated at the affected source is formulated using a finishing material containing no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner containing no more than 3.0 percent VHAP by weight.

(3) Use a control system with an overall control efficiency (R) such that the value of Ein Equation 2 is no greater than 1.0.

The value of Ein Equation 2 shall be calculated using Equation 1; or

(4) Use any combination of an averaging approach, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, compliant finishing materials, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and a control system, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to § 63.802(a)(2)(i) shall comply with the provisions by using compliant foam adhesives with a VHAP content no greater than 1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied.

(c) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to § 63.802(a)(2)(ii) shall comply with those provisions by using either of the methods presented in § 63.804 (c)(1) and (c)(2).

(1) Use compliant contact adhesives with a VHAP content no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; or

(2) Use a control system with an overall control efficiency (R) such that the value of Gis no greater than 1.0.

(d) The owner or operator of a new affected source subject to § 63.802(b)(1) may comply with those provisions by using any of the following methods:

(1) Calculate the average VHAP content across all finishing materials used at the facility using Equation 1, and maintain a value of E no greater than 0.8;

(2) Use compliant finishing materials according to the following criteria:

(i) Demonstrate that each sealer and topcoat has a VHAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, each stain has a VHAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and each thinner contains no more than 10.0 percent VHAP by weight;

(ii) Demonstrate that each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is purchased pre-made, that is, it is not formulated onsite by thinning another finishing material, has a VHAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, and each thinner contains no more than 10.0 percent VHAP by weight; and

(iii) Demonstrate that each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated onsite is formulated using a finishing material containing no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight.

(3) Use a control system with an overall control efficiency (R) such that the value of Ein Equation 4 is no greater than 0.8.

The value of Ein Equation 4 shall be calculated using Equation 1; or

(4) Use any combination of an averaging approach, as described in (d)(1), compliant finishing materials, as described in (d)(2), and a control system, as described in (d)(3).

(e) The owner or operator of a new affected source subject to § 63.802(b)(2) shall comply with the provisions using either of the following methods:

(1) Use compliant contact adhesives with a VHAP content no greater than 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.2 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; or

(2) Use a control system with an overall control efficiency (R) such that the value of Gin Equation 3 is no greater than 0.2.
