####### Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction.

(3)When an individual monitor consistently achieves results at or below 0.9 µg/m, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for that monitoring site. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, zero shall be substituted for the sample result for the monitoring site for any period where a sample is not taken.
