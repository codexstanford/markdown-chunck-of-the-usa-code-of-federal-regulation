() For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must average the test run averages of PM concentrations and PMDS responses to obtain a single pair of data for PM concentration and PMDS response. You may use this pair of data and the zero point to define a linear correlation model for the PMDS.

(D) You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must use the average of the test run averages of PM concentrations for extrapolating the alarm set-point. The PM emission concentration used to extrapolate the alarm set-point must not exceed the PM emission standard, however.
