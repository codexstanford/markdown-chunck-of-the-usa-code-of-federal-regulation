######## et al,

(3) After cooling, dilute the digests to 30 mL with high purity 18M&#x3A9; water prior to ICP-MS (or ICP-OES) analysis. Note that this digestion technique requires adequate safety measures when working with HF at high temperature and pressure. To avoid "carry-over" contamination, rigorously clean the vessels between samples as described in "Microwave digestion procedures for environmental matrixes" (Lough, G.C.Analyst. 1998, 123 (7), 103R-133R).

(b) Analyze the digestates for vanadium as follows:

(1) Perform the analysis using ICP-OES (or ICP-MS) using standard plasma conditions (1350 W forward power) and a desolvating microconcentric nebulizer, which will significantly reduce oxide- and chloride-based interferences.
