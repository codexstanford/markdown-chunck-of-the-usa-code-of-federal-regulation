(3)The purpose of this experiment is to obtain estimates of basic pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, area under the curve) for the test substance. Kinetic data may be required if the data can be used to resolve issues about bioavailability and to clarify whether clearance is saturated in a dose-dependent fashion. For this experiment a minimum of three rats per group is required. At least two doses will be required, usually the NOEL and LOEL from the critical toxicology study. Following administration of test substance, samples should be obtained from each animal at suitable time points appropriate sampling methodology. Total radioactivity present (or total amount of chemical, for nonradioactive materials) should be analyzed in whole blood and plasma using appropriate methods, and the blood/plasma ratio should be calculated.
