###### § 60.533 What compliance and certification requirements must I meet and by when?
####### Criteria for revocation of certification.

(l)(1) The Administrator may revoke certification if it is determined that the wood heaters being manufactured or sold in that model line do not comply with the requirements of this subpart. Such a determination will be based on all available evidence, including but not limited to:

(i) Test data from a retesting of the original unit on which the certification test was conducted or a unit that is similar in all material respects that would affect emissions;

(ii) A finding that the certification test was not valid. The finding will be based on problems or irregularities with the certification test or its documentation, but may be supplemented by other information;

(iii) A finding that the labeling of the wood heater model line, the owner's manual or the associated marketing information does not comply with the requirements of § 60.536;

(iv) Failure by the manufacturer to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements under § 60.537;

(v) Physical examination showing that a significant percentage (as defined in the quality assurance plan approved pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section, but no larger than 1 percent) of production units inspected is not similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative affected wood heater submitted for certification testing;

(vi) Failure of the manufacturer to conduct a quality assurance program in conformity with paragraph (m) of this section; or

(vii) Failure of the approved laboratory to test the wood heater using the methods specified in § 60.534.

(2) Revocation of certification under this paragraph (l) will not take effect until the manufacturer concerned has been given written notice by the Administrator setting forth the basis for the proposed determination and an opportunity to request a hearing under § 60.539.
