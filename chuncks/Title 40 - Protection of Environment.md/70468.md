4.1.3.3.1Evaluate the food chain individual factor based on the fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the target distance limit for the watershed. Assign this factor a value as follows:

- If any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to Level I concentrations, assign a value of 50.

- If not, but if any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.

- If not, but if there is an observed release of a hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater to surface water in the watershed and there is a fishery (or portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the target distance limit, assign a value of 20.

- If there is no observed release to surface water in the watershed or there is no observed release of a hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater, but there is a fishery (or portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the target distance limit, assign a value as follows:

- If there are no fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the target distance limit of the watershed, assign a value of 0.

Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
