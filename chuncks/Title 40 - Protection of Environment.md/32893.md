() In ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R &#x2264; 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:

(C) Measure CO concentration as specified in either Item 2 or 3a of Table 11 of this subpart.

(D) Record and include in the test report an indication of whether the catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator was operated in partial or complete combustion mode and the control device configuration, including whether platinum or palladium combustion promoters were used during the test.
