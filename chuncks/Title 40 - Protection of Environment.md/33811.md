######## Maintenance wastewater

means wastewater generated by the draining of process fluid from components in the MCPU into an individual drain system in preparation for or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can generate maintenance wastewater include descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of pumps into an individual drain system, and draining of portions of the MCPU for repair. Wastewater from routine cleaning operations occurring as part of batch operations is not considered maintenance wastewater.
