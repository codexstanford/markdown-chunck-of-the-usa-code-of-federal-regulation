######## Continuous process

means a process that operates continuously. In a continuous process unit, the materials or shapes that are processed are either continuously charged (fed) to and discharged from the process unit, or are charged and discharged at regular time intervals without the process unit being shut down. Continuous thermal process units, such as tunnel kilns, generally include temperature zones that are maintained at relatively constant temperature and through which the materials or shapes being processed are conveyed continuously or at regular time intervals.
