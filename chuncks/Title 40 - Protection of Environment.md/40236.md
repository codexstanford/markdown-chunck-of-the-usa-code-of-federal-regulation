###### Absorption Pathlength Determination.

H.2.1Perform and document separate linear baseline corrections to each analytical region in the spectral sets {R1} and {R3}. Form a one-dimensional array Acontaining the absorbance values from all segments of {R1} that are associated with the analytical regions; the members of the array are A, i = 1, n. Form a similar one-dimensional array Afrom the absorbance values in the spectral set {R3}; the members of the array are A, i = 1, n. Based on the model A= rA+ E, determine the least-squares estimate of r, the value of r which minimizes the square error E. Calculate the sample absorption pathlength, L, using equation H.1,
