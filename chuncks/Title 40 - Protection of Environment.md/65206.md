(b)-(1)Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 257.101(d), a CCR landfill may continue to receive CCR if the owner or operator certifies that the facility will cease operation of the coal-fired boilers within the timeframe specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, but in the interim period (prior to closure of the coal-fired boiler), the facility must continue to use the CCR landfill due to the absence of alternative disposal capacity both on and off-site of the facility. To qualify under this paragraph, the owner or operator of the CCR landfill must document that all of the following conditions have been met:

(iii) The owner or operator must prepare the annual progress report specified in paragraph (c) of this section documenting the continued lack of alternative capacity and the progress towards the closure of the coal-fired boiler.
