####### Dose levels and dose selection.

(3)(i) At least three dose levels and a concurrent control shall be used.

(ii) The highest dose level should induce toxicity but not high levels of mortality in the parental (P) animals.

(iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any grossly observable evidence of toxicity.

(iv) Ideally the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.
