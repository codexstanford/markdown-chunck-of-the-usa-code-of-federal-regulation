####### Evaluation of results.

(2)(i) The findings of this toxicity study should be evaluated in terms of the observed effects, necropsy and microscopic findings. This evaluation must include the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or absence, incidence and severity of abnormalities, including gross lesions, identified target organs, infertility, clinical abnormalities, affected reproductive and litter performance, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other toxic effects.

(ii) Because of the short period of treatment of the male, the histopathology of the testis and epididymus must be considered along with the fertility data, when assessing male reproductive effects.

(iii) Due to the limited dimensions of the study, statistical analysis in the form of tests for "significance" are of limited value for many endpoints, especially reproductive endpoints. If statistical analyses are used then the method chosen should be appropriate for the distribution of the variable examined, and be selected prior to the start of the study. Because of the small group size, the use of historic control data (e.g., for litter size), where available, may also be useful as an aid to the interpretation of the study.
