####### Calculating emissions rate.

(v)"Emissions rate" (in lbs/mmBtu) is the weighted average emissions rate for sulfur dioxide of all units and generators, within and outside the dispatch system, that contributed to the dispatch system's electrical output for the year, calculated as follows:

(A) "Fraction of generation within dispatch system" is the fraction of the dispatch system's total sales accounted for by generation from units and generators within the dispatch system, other than generation from non-utility generators. This term equals the total generation (in Kwh) by all units and generators within the dispatch system for the calendar year minus the total non-utility generation from non-utility generators within the dispatch system for the calendar year and divided by the total sales (in Kwh) by the dispatch system for the calendar year.

(B) Dispatch system emissions rate" is the weighted average rate (in lbs/mmBtu) for the dispatch system calculated as follows:

Dispatch system emissions rate =

(C) "Fraction of generation from non-utility generators" is the fraction of the dispatch system's total sales accounted for by generation acquired from non-utility generators within or outside the dispatch system. This term equals the total non-utility generation from non-utility generators (within or outside the dispatch system) for the calendar year divided by the total sales (in Kwh) by the dispatch system for the calendar year.

(D) "Non-utility generator" is a power production facility (within or outside the dispatch system) that is not an affected unit or a sulfur-free generator and that has a "non-utility generator emissions rate" for the calendar year under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(F) of this section.

(E) "Non-utility generation" is the generation (in Kwh) that the dispatch system acquired from a non-utility generator during the calendar year as required by Federal or State law or an order of a utility regulatory authority or under a contract awarded as the result of a power purchase solicitation required by Federal or State law or an order of a utility regulatory authority.

(F) "Non-utility generator average emissions rate" is the weighted average rate (in lbs/mmBtu) for the non-utility generators calculated as follows:

Non-utility generator average emissions rate =
