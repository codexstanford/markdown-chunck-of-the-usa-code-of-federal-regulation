###### ยง 1051.515 How do I test my fuel tank for permeation emissions?
####### Determination of final test result.

(c)To determine the final test result, apply a deterioration factor to the measured emission level. The deterioration factor is the difference between permeation emissions measured before and after the durability testing described in paragraph (d) of this section. Adjust the baseline test results for each tested fuel tank by adding the deterioration factor to the measured emissions. The deterioration factor determination must be based on good engineering judgement. Therefore, during the durability testing, the test tank may not exceed the fuel tank permeation standard described in ยง 1051.110 (this is known as "line-crossing"). If the deterioration factor is less than zero, use zero.
