####### Batch emission episode

means a discrete venting episode that is associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode. For example, a batch distillation unit operation may consist of batch emission episodes associated with charging and heating. Charging the vessel with HAP will result in one discrete batch emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the charge. Another discrete batch emission episode will result from the expulsion of expanded vapor as the contents of the vessel are heated.
