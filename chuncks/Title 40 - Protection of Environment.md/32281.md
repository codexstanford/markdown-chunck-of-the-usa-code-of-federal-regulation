() Test data obtained for a batch emission episode from another process train where the test data were obtained during production of the product for which the demonstration is being made. Test data from another process train may be used only if the owner or operator can demonstrate that the data are representative of the batch emission episode for which the demonstration is being made, taking into account the nature, size, operating conditions, production rate, and sequence of process steps (e.g., reaction, distillation, etc.) of the equipment in the other process train.

(B) Previous test data for the batch emission episode with the highest organic HAP emissions on a mass basis where the measurement of organic HAP emissions was an outcome of the test, where data were obtained during the production of the product for which the demonstration is being made, and where the data show a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using the applicable equations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section. If the criteria in this paragraph are met, then engineering assessment may be used for all batch emission episodes associated with that batch cycle for the batch unit operation.

(C) The owner or operator has requested and been granted approval to use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode. The request to use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode shall contain sufficient information and data to demonstrate to the Administrator that engineering assessment is an accurate means of estimating organic HAP emissions for that particular batch emissions episode. The request to use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions for a batch emissions episode shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report, as required by ยง 63.1417(d).

(ii) Engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the following:

(A) Previous test results, provided the tests are representative of current operating practices;

(B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data obtained under conditions representative of current process operating conditions;

(C) Flow rate or organic HAP emission rate specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the batch process vent; and

(D) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to:
