11.2.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2), including the number of non-operating ovens. Record the clock time at the start of the traverse on each side of the battery. Record which side is being inspected (coke side or push side). Other information may be recorded at the discretion of the observer, such as the location of the leak (top of the door, chuck door, etc.), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (overcast, partly sunny, etc.).

11.2.3.1 Begin the test run by starting the stopwatch and traversing either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing one side, stop the watch. Complete this procedure on the other side. If inspecting more than one battery, the observer may view the push sides and the coke sides sequentially.
