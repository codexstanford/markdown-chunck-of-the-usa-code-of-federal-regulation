(i)(A) Indiana Administrative Code 326: Air Pollution Control Board, Article 15 Lead, Rule 1 Lead Emissions Limitations, Section 2-Source Specific Provisions, subsection (a), subdivision 7, clauses (A) through (G). Amended at 22 Indiana Register 1427, effective February 5, 1999.

(130) On February 3, 1999, Indiana submitted a site specific SIP revision request for the Central Soya Company, Incorporated, Marion County, Indiana. The submitted revision amends 326 IAC 6-1-12(a), and provides for revised particulate matter emission totals for a number of source operations at the plant. The revision reflects the closure of nine operations and the addition of five new ones, resulting in a net reduction in particulate matter emissions.
