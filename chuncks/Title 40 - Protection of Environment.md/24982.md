(i) A copy of the closure report submitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; and

(ii) A copy of the initial performance test report demonstrating that the 15-year minimum control period has expired, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), or information that demonstrates that the gas collection and control system will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flows.
