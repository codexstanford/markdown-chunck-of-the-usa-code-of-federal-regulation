###### ยง 52.1835 Change to approved plan.

North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 33-15-12, Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources, is removed from the approved plan. This change is a result of the State's September 10, 1997 request for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Clean Air Act New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) promulgated in 40 CFR Part 60, as in effect on October 1, 1996 (except subpart Eb, which the State has not adopted). EPA granted that delegation of authority on May 28, 1998.
