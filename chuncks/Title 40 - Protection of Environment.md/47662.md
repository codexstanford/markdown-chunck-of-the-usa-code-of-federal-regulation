(3)Each manufacturer shall provide or cause to be provided to the persons specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and to any other interested parties a manufacturer-specific Web site containing the information specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for vehicles identified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have been offered for sale; this requirement does not apply to indirect information, including the information specified in paragraphs (f)(12) through (f)(16) of this section. Each manufacturer Web site shall-

(i) Provide access in full-text to all of the information specified in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

(ii) Be updated at the same time as manufacturer-franchised dealership World Wide Web sites;

(iii) Provide users with a description of the minimum computer hardware and software needed by the user to access that manufacturer's information (e.g., computer processor speed and operating system software). This description shall appear when users first log-on to the home page of the manufacturer's Web site.

(iv) Provide Short-Term (24 to 72 hours), Mid-Term (30-day period), and Long-Term (365-day period) Web site subscription options to any person specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section whereby the user will be able to access the site, search for the information, and purchase, view and print the information at a fair and reasonable cost as specified in paragraph (f)(7) of this section for each of the options. In addition, for each of the subscription options, manufacturers are required to make their entire site accessible for the respective period of time and price. In other words, a manufacturer may not limit any or all of the subscription options to just one make or one model.

(v) Allow the user to search the manufacturer Web site by various topics including but not limited to model, model year, key words or phrases, etc., while allowing ready identification of the latest vehicle calibration. Manufacturers who do not use model year to classify their vehicles in their service information may use an alternate vehicle delineation such as body series. Any manufacturer utilizing this flexibility shall create a cross-reference to the corresponding model year and provide this cross-reference on the manufacturer Web site home page.

(vi) Provide accessibility using common, readily available software and shall not require the use of software, hardware, viewers, or browsers that are not readily available to the general public. Manufacturers shall also provide hyperlinks to any plug-ins, viewers or browsers (e.g. Adobe Acrobat or Netscape) needed to access the manufacturer Web site.

(vii) Allow simple hyper-linking to the manufacturer Web site from government Web sites and automotive-related Web sites.

(viii) Allow access to the manufacturer Web sites with no limits on the modem speed by which aftermarket service providers or other interested parties can connect to the manufacturer Web site.

(ix) Possess sufficient server capacity to allow ready access by all users and have sufficient capacity to assure that all users may obtain needed information without undue delay.

(x) Correct or delete broken Web links on a weekly basis.

(xi) Allow for Web site navigation that does not require a user to return to the manufacturer home page or a search engine in order to access a different portion of the site.

(xii) Allow all users to print out any and all of the materials required to be made available on the manufacturers Web site, including the ability to print it at the users location.
