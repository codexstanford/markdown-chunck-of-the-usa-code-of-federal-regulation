####### Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA).

4.1.1.5Perform the RATA of the Hg CEMS at normal load. Acceptable Hg reference methods for the RATA include ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008), "Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)" (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and Methods 29, 30A, and 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter. When Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 is used, paired sampling trains are required and the filterable portion of the sample need not be included when making comparisons to the Hg CEMS results for purposes of a RATA. To validate a Method 29 or ASTM D6784-02 test run, calculate the relative deviation (RD) using Equation A-1 of this section, and assess the results as follows to validate the run. The RD must not exceed 10 percent, when the average Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 µg/dscm. If the RD specification is met, the results of the two samples shall be averaged arithmetically.
