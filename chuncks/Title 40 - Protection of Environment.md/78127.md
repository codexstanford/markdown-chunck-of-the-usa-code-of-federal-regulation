###### ยง 702.61 Service of notice.
####### Notice as a prerequisite to suit.

(a)Under section 20 of TSCA, no civil action may be commenced by a citizen to restrain a violation of TSCA, or a rule or order thereunder, unless at least 60 days in advance the citizen has given notice of the intent to file suit to the Administrator and to the person who is alleged to have committed the violation. No civil action may be commenced by a citizen to compel the Administrator to perform any non-discretionary act or duty under TSCA, unless at least 60 days in advance the citizen has given notice of the intent to file suit to the Administrator. However, in the case of an alleged failure by the Administrator to file an action under section 7 of TSCA, the citizen must give notice to the Administrator only 10 days in advance of filing the civil action.
