####### Redetermination of applicability to APPU that are flexible operations process units.

(7)Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be expected to cause a flexible operations process unit to no longer be an APPU (i.e., amino/phenolic resins will no longer be the primary product according to the determination procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section), the owner or operator shall reevaluate the status of the process unit as an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has ceased to be an APPU subject to this subpart if the following criteria are met:

(i) If amino/phenolic resins were not produced for the greatest operating time over the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter;

(ii) If the new primary product, which is not amino/phenolic resins, is subject to another subpart of this part; and

(iii) If the owner or operator has notified the Administrator of the pending change in status for the flexible operations process unit, as specified in ยง 63.1417(h)(4).
