###### ยง 1065.690 Buoyancy correction for PM sample media.
####### PM sample media density.

(b)Different PM sample media have different densities. Use the known density of your sample media, or use one of the densities for some common sampling media, as follows:

(1) For PTFE-coated borosilicate glass, use a sample media density of 2300 kg/m.

(2) For PTFE membrane (film) media with an integral support ring of polymethylpentene that accounts for 95% of the media mass, use a sample media density of 920 kg/m.

(3) For PTFE membrane (film) media with an integral support ring of PTFE, use a sample media density of 2144 kg/m.
