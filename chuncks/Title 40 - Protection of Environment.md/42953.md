###### Reburning

means reducing the coal and combustion air to the main burners and injecting a reburn fuel (such as gas or oil) to create a fuel-rich secondary combustion zone above the main burner zone and final combustion air to create a fuel-lean burnout zone. The formation of NOis inhibited in the main burner zone due to the reduced combustion intensity, and NOis destroyed in the fuel-rich secondary combustion zone by conversion to molecular nitrogen.
