######## Electroforming

means an electrolytic process using or emitting any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, that is used for fabricating metal parts. This process is essentially the same as electroplating except that the plated substrate (mandrel) is removed, leaving only the metal plate. In electroforming, the metal plate is self-supporting and generally thicker than in electroplating.
