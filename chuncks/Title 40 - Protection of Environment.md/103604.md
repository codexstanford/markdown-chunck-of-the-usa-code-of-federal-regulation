######## Burner-based platform.,Cycle development.

(2)(i)The burner-based platform will be able to meet the exhaust flow, temperature, NO, and oil consumption targets directly without the need for additional cycle development. This process assumes that you have already implemented and validated your oil consumption exposure methods to reach the necessary levels of bulk oil exposure. In addition, you must meet the oxygen and water targets during aging modes within +/-2% for oxygen and +/-2% for water. Note that during transitions you may utilize any combination of conditions necessary to help primary component catalysts reach the target temperature and flow conditions within no more than 5 minutes. For example, you may use a higher exhaust flow rate and lower temperature to rapidly cool the aftertreatment system to the next temperature. NO, oxygen, and water targets do not need to be met during transitions.
