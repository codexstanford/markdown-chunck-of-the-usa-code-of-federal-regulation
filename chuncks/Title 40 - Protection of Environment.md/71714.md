##### ยง 403.13 Variances from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors.
###### Review of requests by EPA.

(l)(1) Where the Administrator (or his delegate) finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, he shall deny the request for a variance and send a copy of his determination to the Director, to the POTW, and to the requester (and to the Industrial User, where they are not the same).

(2) Where the Administrator (or his delegate) finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, and that a partial or full variance is justified, he will approve the variance. In approving the variance, the Administrator (or his delegate) will:

(i) Prepare recommended alternative discharge limits for the Industrial User either more or less stringent than those prescribed by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard to the extent warranted by the demonstrated fundamentally different factors;

(ii) Provide the following information in his written determination:

(A) The recommended alternative discharge limits for the Industrial User concerned;

(B) The rationale for the adjustment of the Pretreatment Standard (including the reasons for recommending that the variance be granted) and an explanation of how the recommended alternative discharge limits were derived;

(C) The supporting evidence submitted to the Administrator (or his delegate); and

(D) Other information considered by the Administrator (or his delegate) in developing the recommended alternative discharge limits;

(iii) Notify the Director and the POTW of his or her determination; and

(iv) Send the information described in paragraphs (l)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section to the Requestor (and to the Industrial User where they are not the same).
