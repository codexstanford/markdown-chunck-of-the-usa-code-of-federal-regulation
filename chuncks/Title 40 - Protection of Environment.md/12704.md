####### Other emission sources,Applicability.

(x)-(1)(i) The requirements of paragraph (x) of this section shall apply to a plant's VOM emission sources, which are not included within any of the source categories specified in subpart (B), (Q) (excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), (R) (excluding sections 215.447, 215.450, and 215.452), (S), (V), (X), (Y) (sections 215.582, 215.583, and 215.584), or (Z) of 35 Ill.

A plant is subject to paragraph (x) of this section if it contains process emission sources, not regulated by subpart (B), (Q) (excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), (R) (excluding sections 215.447, 215.450, and 215.452), (S), (V), (X), (Y) (sections 215.582, 215.583, and 215.584), or (Z) of 35 Ill.

(A) Have maximum theoretical emissions of 91 Mg (100 tons) or more per calendar year of VOM if no air pollution control equipment were used, and

(B) Are not limited to less than 91 Mg (100 tons) of VOM emissions per calendar year in the absence of air pollution control equipment, through production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or a SIP of FIP revision.

(ii) If a plant ceases to fulfill the criteria of paragraph (x)(1)(i) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (x) of this section shall continue to apply to an emission source which was ever subject to the control requirements of paragraph (x)(3) of this section.

(iii) No limits under paragraph (x) of this section shall apply to emission sources with emissions of VOM to the atmosphere less than or equal to 2.3 Mg (2.5 tons) per calendar year if the total emissions from such sources not complying with paragraph (x)(3) of this section does not exceed 4.5 Mg (5.0 tons) per calendar year.

(iv) For the purposes of paragraph (x) of this section, an emission source shall be considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules) or paragraph if it is subject to the limits of that subpart (of the Illinois rules) or paragraph. An emission source is not considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules) or paragraph of its emissions are below the applicability cutoff level or if the source is covered by an exemption.
