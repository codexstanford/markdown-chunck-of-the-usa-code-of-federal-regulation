####### Method Detection Limit (MDL).

(m)Calculate the estimated MDL using the guidance provided in 40 CFR, Part 136 Appendix B. It is essential that all sample processing steps of the analytical method be included in the determination of the method detection limit. Take a minimum of seven blank filters from each lot to be used and calculate the detection limit by processing each through the entire candidate analytical method. Make all computations according to the defined method with the final results in µg/m. The MDL of the candidate method must be equal to, or less than 5% of the level of the Pb NAAQS.
