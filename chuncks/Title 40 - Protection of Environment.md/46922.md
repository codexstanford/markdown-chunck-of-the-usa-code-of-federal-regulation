####### Drive schedule for partial refueling test.

(3)The Administrator may conduct a partial refueling test involving a shortening of the drive procedures described in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section and a modified soak and refueling procedure as described in paragraph (e) of this section and ยง 86.154-98(e)(7)(i). The drive shall be performed as described in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section except that the drive shall be terminated when at least 10 percent but no more than 85 percent of the fuel tank nominal capacity has been consumed and not partway through a UDDS cycle. The amount of fuel consumed in the drive shall be determined by multiplying the number of UDDSs driven by the mileage accumulated per UDDS and dividing by the fuel economy for the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle.
