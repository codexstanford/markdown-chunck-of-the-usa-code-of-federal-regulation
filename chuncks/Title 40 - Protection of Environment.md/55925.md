###### § 141.72 Disinfection.
####### Giardia lamblia

(1) The disinfection treatment must be sufficient to ensure that the total treatment processes of that system achieve at least 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation and/or removal ofcysts and at least 99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation and/or removal of viruses, as determined by the State.

(2) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (c)(2), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours.

(3)(i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (c)(3), cannot be undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in § 141.74(a)(1), is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining compliance with this requirement. Thus, the value "V" in the following formula cannot exceed 5 percent in one month, for any two consecutive months.

(ii) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified in § 141.74(a)(1) and that the system is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section do not apply.
