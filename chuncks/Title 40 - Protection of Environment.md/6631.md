#### PART 51 - REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
##### Appendix P to Part 51 - Minimum Emission Monitoring Requirements
###### Special Consideration.,i.e.

6The State plan may provide for approval, on a case-by-case basis, of alternative monitoring requirements different from the provisions of parts 1 through 5 of this appendix if the provisions of this appendix (, the installation of a continuous emission monitoring system) cannot be implemented by a source due to physical plant limitations or extreme economic reasons. To make use of this provision, States must include in their plan specific criteria for determining those physical limitations or extreme economic situations to be considered by the State. In such cases, when the State exempts any source subject to this appendix by use of this provision from installing continuous emission monitoring systems, the State shall set forth alternative emission monitoring and reporting requirements (e.g., periodic manual stack tests) to satisfy the intent of these regulations. Examples of such special cases include, but are not limited to, the following:

6.1 Alternative monitoring requirements may be prescribed when installation of a continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this appendix would not provide accurate determinations of emissions (e.g., condensed, uncombined water vapor may prevent an accurate determination of opacity using commercially available continuous monitoring systems).

6.2 Alternative monitoring requirements may be prescribed when the affected facility is infrequently operated (e.g., some affected facilities may operate less than one month per year).

6.3 Alternative monitoring requirements may be prescribed when the State determines that the requirements of this appendix would impose an extreme economic burden on the source owner or operator.

6.4 Alternative monitoring requirements may be prescribed when the State determines that monitoring systems prescribed by this appendix cannot be installed due to physical limitations at the facility.
