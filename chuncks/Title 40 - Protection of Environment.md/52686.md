####### Reduced emissions completion

means a well completion following hydraulic fracturing where gas flowback emissions from the gas outlet of the separator that are otherwise vented are captured, cleaned, and routed to the flow line or collection system, re-injected into the well or another well, used as an on-site fuel source, or used for other useful purpose that a purchased fuel or raw material would serve, with de minimis direct venting to the atmosphere. Short periods of flaring during a reduced emissions completion may occur.
