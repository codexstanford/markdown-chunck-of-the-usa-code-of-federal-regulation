####### § 63.1221 What are the replacement standards for hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns?
######## Emission and hazardous waste feed limits for new sources.

(b)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere or feed hazardous waste that contain:

(1) For dioxins and furans, either:

(i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or

(ii) Rapid quench of the combustion gas temperature at the exit of the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery system that immediately follows the last combustion chamber) to 400 &#xB0;F or lower based on the average of the test run average temperatures. You must also notify in writing the RCRA authority that you are complying with this option;

(2) For mercury, either:

(i) Emissions in excess of 120 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or

(ii) A hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to a maximum theoretical emission concentration (MTEC) in excess of 120 µgm/dscm;

(3) For cadmium and lead, both:

(i) Emissions in excess of 3.7 x 10lbs combined emissions of cadmium and lead attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste; and

(ii) Emissions in excess of 43 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, both:

(i) In excess of 3.3 x 10lbs combined emissions of arsenic, beryllium, and chromium attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste;

(ii) Emissions in excess of 110 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
