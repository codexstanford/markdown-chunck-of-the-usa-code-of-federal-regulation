####### Extra samples

are non-creditable samples. They are daily values that do not occur on scheduled sampling days and that cannot be used as make-up samples for missed or invalidated scheduled samples. Extra samples are used in mean calculations and are included in the series of all daily values subject to selection as a 98th percentile value, but are not used to determine which value in the sorted list represents the 98th percentile.
