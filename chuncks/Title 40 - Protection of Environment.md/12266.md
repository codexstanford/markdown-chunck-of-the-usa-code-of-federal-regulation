####### Liquid/gas method

means either of two methods for determining capture which require both gas phase and liquid phase measurements and analysis. The first method requires construction of a TTE. The second method uses the building or room which houses the facility as an enclosure. The second method requires that all other VOM sources within the room be shut down while the test is performed, but all fans and blowers within the room must be operated according to normal procedures.
