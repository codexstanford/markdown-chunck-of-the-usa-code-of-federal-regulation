###### § 84.9 Allocation of calendar-year production allowances.

(a) The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year production allowances to entities that produced a regulated substance in 2020. The number of production allowances allocated to each eligible entity for 2022-2023 is calculated as follows:

(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted production amounts that each eligible entity reported to the agency for calendar years 2011 through 2019;

(2) Sum the "average high year" values determined in step 1 of all eligible entities and determine each entity's percentage of that total;

(3) Determine the amount of general pool production allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 and the set-aside in § 84.15 from the production cap in § 84.7(b)(3);

(4) Determine individual entities' production allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in step 2 by the amount of general pool allowances determined in step 3.

(b)(1) EPA will allocate calendar year production allowances to individual entities by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used based on the exchange value-weighted quantities calculated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(2) EPA will provide public notice of the list of companies receiving production allowances as well as the quantities they will be allocated by that date.

(3) In addition to the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the relevant agency official will allocate calendar year production allowances to entities that qualified for allowances under § 84.15.

(4) If there are remaining production allowances after distribution from the set-aside under § 84.15, the relevant agency official will distribute such allowances on a pro rata basis to the entities in paragraph (a) of this section by March 31 of the calendar year in which the allowances may be used.
