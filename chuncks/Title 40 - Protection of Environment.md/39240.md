######## Chemical manufacturing process

means all equipment which collectively functions to produce a product or isolated intermediate. A process includes, but is not limited to any, all, or a combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce a product or isolated intermediate. A process is also defined by the following:

(1) All cleaning operations;

(2) Each nondedicated solvent recovery operation is considered a single process;

(3) Each nondedicated formulation operation is considered a single process;

(4) Quality assurance/quality control laboratories are not considered part of any process;

(5) Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of any process; and

(6) The end of a process that produces a solid material is either up to and including the dryer or extruder, or for a polymer production process without a dryer or extruder, it is up to and including the die plate or solid-state reactor, except in two cases. If the dryer, extruder, die plate, or solid-state reactor is followed by an operation that is designed and operated to remove HAP solvent or residual monomer from the solid, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process. If the dried solid is diluted or mixed with a HAP-based solvent, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process.
