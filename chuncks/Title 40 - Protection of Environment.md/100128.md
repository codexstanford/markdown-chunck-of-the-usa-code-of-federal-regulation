(6) Calculate statistical values to characterize cumulative test results at least once per day based on an equal number of coastdown runs in each direction. Determine the wind-averaged drag area value for the testby averaging allvalues for all days of testing. Determine the upper and lower bounds of the drag area value,, expressed to two decimal places, using a confidence interval as follows:
