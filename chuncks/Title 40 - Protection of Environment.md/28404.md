####### Pitch storage tanks.

(g)The owner or operator must demonstrate initial compliance with the standard for pitch storage tanks in §§ 63.843(d) and 63.844(d) by preparing a design evaluation or by conducting a performance test. The owner or operator must submit for approval by the regulatory authority the information specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, along with the information specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section where a design evaluation is performed or the information specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section where a performance test is conducted.

(1) A description of the parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control device is being properly operated and maintained, an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters), and the frequency with which monitoring will be performed; and

(2) Where a design evaluation is performed, documentation demonstrating that the control device used achieves the required control efficiency during reasonably expected maximum filling rate. The documentation shall include a description of the gas stream that enters the control device, including flow and POM content under varying liquid level conditions, and the information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(vi) of this section, as applicable.

(i) If the control device receives vapors, gases, or liquids, other than fuels, from emission points other than pitch storage tanks, the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device;

(ii) If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 degrees C (1,400 degrees F) is used to meet the emission reduction requirement specified in § 63.843(d) and § 63.844(d), documentation that those conditions exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of § 63.843(d) and § 63.844(d);

(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, for thermal incinerators, the design evaluation shall include the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, the flow rate of the organic HAP emission stream, the combustion temperature, and the residence time at the combustion temperature;

(iv) If the pitch storage tank is vented to the emission control system installed for control of emissions from the paste production plant pursuant to § 63.843(b) or § 63.844(b)(1), documentation of compliance with the requirements of § 63.843(b) is sufficient to meet the requirements of § 63.843(d) or § 63.844(d);

(v) For carbon adsorbers, the design evaluation shall include the affinity of the organic vapors for carbon, the amount of carbon in each bed, the number of beds, the humidity of the feed gases, the temperature of the feed gases, the flow rate of the organic HAP emission stream, and if applicable, the desorption schedule, the regeneration stream pressure or temperature, and the flow rate of the regeneration stream. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included; and

(vi) For condensers, the design evaluation shall include the final temperature of the organic HAP vapors, the type of condenser, and the design flow rate of the organic HAP emission stream.

(3) If a performance test is conducted, the owner or operator shall determine the control efficiency for POM during tank loading using Method 315 in appendix A to this part. The owner or operator shall include the following information:

(i) Identification of the pitch storage tank and control device for which the performance test will be submitted; and

(ii) Identification of the emission point(s) that share the control device with the pitch storage tank and for which the performance test will be conducted.
