(e)For a locomotive equipped with features that shut the engine off after prolonged periods of idle, multiply the measured idle mass emission rate over the idle portion of the applicable test cycles by a factor equal to one minus the estimated fraction reduction in idling time that will result in use from the shutdown feature. Do not apply this factor to the weighted idle power. Application of this adjustment is subject to our approval if the fraction reduction in idling time that is estimated to result from the shutdown feature is greater than 25 percent. This paragraph (e) does not apply if the locomotive is (or will be) covered by a separate certificate for idle control.
