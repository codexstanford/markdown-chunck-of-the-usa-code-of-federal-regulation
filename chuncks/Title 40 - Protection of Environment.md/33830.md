######## Recovery device

means an individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering chemicals from process vent streams and from wastewater streams for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. For the purposes of meeting requirements in table 2 to this subpart, the recovery device must not be a process condenser and must recover chemicals to be reused in a process on site. Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery device for a wastewater stream, a decanter and any other equipment based on the operating principle of gravity separation must receive only multi-phase liquid streams.
