####### Waiver from submitting test results.

(g)An applicant for certification may apply for a potential waiver of the requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, if the central heater meets either of the following conditions:

(1) The central heaters of the model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions, as defined in ยง 60.5473 and paragraph (k) of this section, to another model line that has already been issued a certificate of compliance.

(2) The manufacturer has previously conducted a valid certification test to demonstrate that the central heaters of the model line meet the applicable standard specified in ยง 60.5474.
