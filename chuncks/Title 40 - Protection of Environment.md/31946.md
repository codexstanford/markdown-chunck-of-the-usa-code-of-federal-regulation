####### Catalytic incinerators.

(viii)For each catalytic incinerator, the parameter levels that the owner or operator shall establish are the minimum temperature of the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed and the minimum temperature difference across the catalyst bed. The owner or operator shall monitor the temperature of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed, and calculate the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, at least once every 15 minutes during the period in which the catalytic incinerator is controlling HAP from an emission stream subject to the standards in ยง 63.1362.

(A) The temperature monitoring devices must be accurate to within +/-0.75 percent of the temperature measured in degrees Celsius or +/-2.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater.

(B) The temperature monitoring devices must be calibrated annually.
