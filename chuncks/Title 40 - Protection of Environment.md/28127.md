####### Weld-through preconstruction primer (specialty coating)

means a coating that provides corrosion protection for steel during inventory, is typically applied at less than 1 mil dry film thickness, does not require removal prior to welding, is temperature resistant (burn back from a weld is less than 1.25 centimeters [0.5 inch]), and does not normally require removal before applying film-building coatings, including inorganic zinc high-build coatings. When constructing new vessels, there may be a need to remove areas of weld-through preconstruction primer due to surface damage or contamination prior to application of film-building coatings.
