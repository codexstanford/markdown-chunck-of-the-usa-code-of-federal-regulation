###### Selective noncatalytic reduction

means a noncombustion control technology that destroys NOby injecting a reducing agent (e.g., ammonia, urea, or cyanuric acid) into the flue gas, downstream of the combustion zone that converts NOto molecular nitrogen, water, and when urea or cyanuric acid are used, to carbon dioxide (CO).
