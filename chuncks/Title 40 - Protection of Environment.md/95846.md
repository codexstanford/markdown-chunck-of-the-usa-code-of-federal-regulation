####### Example of statistical analysis.,1

(A)() Mortality data for the embryonic stage, fry stage and for both stages in replicate exposure chambers should first be analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with interaction model. This analysis will determine if replicates are significantly different from each other. If a significant difference between replicates or a significant interaction exists, cause for the difference should be determined. Modification should then be made in the test apparatus or in handling procedures for future toxicity tests. Further calculations should incorporate the separation of replicates. If no significant difference is observed, replicates may be pooled in further analyses.
