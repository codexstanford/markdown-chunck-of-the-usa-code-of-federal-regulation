(A) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you may use Method 320 of appendix A to this part. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source. As an alternative to Method 320 of appendix A to this part, you may use ASTM Method D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference,§ 63.14), with the caveats that the test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM Method D6348-12el, Sections Al through A8 are mandatory; and in ASTM Method D6348-12e1 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R &#x2264; 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:
