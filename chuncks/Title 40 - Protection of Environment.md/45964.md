For transient NMHC (NMHCE), CO, NO. and for idle CO, the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)() of this section. The deterioration factor must be calculated by dividing the exhaust emissions at full useful life by the stabilized mileage emission level (reference ยง 86.096-26(c)(4), e.g., 125 hours). However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)().
