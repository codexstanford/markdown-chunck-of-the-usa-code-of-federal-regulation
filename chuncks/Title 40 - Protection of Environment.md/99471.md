####### Exempted

means relating to a locomotive that is not required to meet otherwise applicable standards. Exempted locomotives must conform to regulatory conditions specified for an exemption in this part 1033 or in 40 CFR part 1068. Exempted locomotives are deemed to be "subject to" the standards of this part, even though they are not required to comply with the otherwise applicable requirements. Locomotives exempted with respect to a certain tier of standards may be required to comply with an earlier tier of standards as a condition of the exemption; for example, locomotives exempted with respect to Tier 3 standards may be required to comply with Tier 2 standards.
