###### ยง 1039.665 Special provisions for use of engines in emergency situations.

This section specifies provisions that allow for temporarily disabling emission controls during qualified emergency situations. For purposes of this section, a qualified emergency situation is one in which the condition of an engine's emission controls poses a significant direct or indirect risk to human life. An example of a direct risk would be an emission control condition that inhibits the performance of an engine being used to rescue a person from a life-threatening situation. An example of an indirect risk would be an emission control condition that inhibits the performance of an engine being used to provide electrical power to a data center that routes "911" emergency response telecommunications.
