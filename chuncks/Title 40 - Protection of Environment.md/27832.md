() Where the mass rate of total organic HAP is being calculated, only the organic HAP species shall be summed using equation 17 in paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. The list of organic HAP is provided in ยง 63.104 of subpart F of this part.

(C) Calculate the destruction or removal efficiency for TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP using equation 18:

(3) Determine the capture efficiency Fof each capture system to which organic HAP and VOC emissions from coating operations are vented. The capture efficiency value shall be determined using Procedure T-Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure as found in appendix B to ยง 52.741 of part 52 of this chapter for total enclosures, and the capture efficiency protocol specified in ยง 52.741(a)(4)(iii) of part 52 of this chapter for all other enclosures.
