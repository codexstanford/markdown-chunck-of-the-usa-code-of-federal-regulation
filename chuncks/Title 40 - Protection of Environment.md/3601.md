####### ยง 49.166 Program overview.
######## When and where does this program apply?

(c)(1) The provisions of this program apply to new major sources and major modifications at existing major sources located in nonattainment areas in all Indian reservation lands where no EPA-approved program is in place and all other areas of Indian country where no EPA-approved program is in place and over which an Indian tribe, or the EPA, has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction, and where there is no EPA-approved nonattainment major NSR program beginning on August 30, 2011. The provisions of this program apply only to new sources and modifications that are major for the regulated NSR pollutant(s) for which the area is designated nonattainment.

(2) The provisions of this program cease to apply in an area covered by an EPA-approved implementation plan on the date that our approval of that implementation plan becomes effective, provided that the plan includes provisions that comply with the requirements of part D of title I of the Act and ยง 51.165 of this chapter for the construction of new major sources and major modifications at existing major sources in nonattainment areas. Permits previously issued under this program will remain in effect and be enforceable as a practical matter until and unless the Tribe issues new permits to these sources based on the provisions of the EPA-approved Tribal implementation plan.
