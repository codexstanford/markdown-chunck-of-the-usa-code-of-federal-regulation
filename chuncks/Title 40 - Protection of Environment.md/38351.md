####### Adjustment of Span.

5.1.6If you discover that a span adjustment is needed (e.g., if the Hg concentration readings exceed the span value for a significant percentage of the unit operating hours in a calendar quarter), you must implement the span adjustment within 90 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which you identify the need for the adjustment. A diagnostic linearity check is required within 168 unit or stack operating hours after changing the span value.
