(a)-(b)(1) [Reserved]

(2) Determination-EPA has determined that, as of July 19, 1995, the Reading ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to this area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Reading ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.

(c) VOC and NORACT determination for six emission units at U.S. Steel-Fairless: no. 3 blast furnace, no. 1 open hearth furnace, no. 1 soaking pits, no. 2 soaking pits (units 1-8), no. 2 soaking pits (units 9-16), 80 in. hot strip mill. The NORACT determination for all the soaking pits and the 80 in. hot strip mill is low excess air (LEA), which is expected to result in a 13.5% emission reduction. NORACT for the other sources is determined to be good operating practices to minimize NOemissions. VOC RACT for all the above sources is determined to be good operating practices to minimize VOC emissions.

NOand VOC RACT for the unit #11 boiler is determined to be good air pollution control practices such that emissions limits shall be 21.7 pounds of NOper ton of coal fired (lb/ton) and 0.1459 lb/MMBtu of No. 2 oil fired with annual fuel usage records, and no more than 867 tons per year (TPY) of NOand 3 TPY of VOC. NOand VOC RACT for the auxiliary boiler is determined to be the requirements of 25 Pa Code 129.93 (c)(1), pertaining to units with individual rated gross heat inputs less than 20 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr) of operation maintenance and operation in accordance with manufacturer's specifications, and the units are operated using good air pollution control practices.

(g) Caparo Steel Company-VOC and NORACT determination for four emission units at Caparo Steel Company, not covered by operating permit OP 43-285: Package boilers, BW boiler #1, BW boiler #2, and BW boiler #3. NORACT for the package boilers is determined to be good air pollution control practices such that NOemissions do not exceed 550 pounds of NOper million cubic feet (lb NO/MMft) of natural gas and 529.82 tons of NOper year (TPY). VOC RACT for the package boilers is determined to be good air pollution control practices such that VOC emissions do not exceed 1.4 lb VOC/MMftof natural gas and 1.35 TPY. NORACT for each of the BW boilers is determined to be good air pollution control practices such that NOemissions do not exceed 23 lb NO/MMftof BFG and 80.1 TPY.

(h) VOC RACT determination for four emission units at Mercersburg Tanning Company-Franklin County: Spray Lines 3 thru 7, Attic Line, Spray Lines A and B, Spray Line C.

VOC RACT for cleaning solvents associated with Lines A and B vented to RTO and water utilized as cleaning solvent for Line C.

(i)(1) EPA approves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Post 1996 (ROP) plan SIP revision for milestone years 1999, 2002, and 2005 for the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on April 30, 1998, July 31, 1998 and supplemented on February 25, 2000.

The enforceable commitments are to:

(1) Submit measures by October 31, 2001 for additional emission reductions as required in the attainment demonstration test, and to revise the SIP and motor vehicle emissions budgets by October 31, 2001 if the additional measures affect the motor vehicle emissions inventory,

These revisions were submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on January 17, 2003. Submission of these revised MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions inventories was a requirement of EPA's approval of the attainment demonstration under paragraph (j) of this section.

(m) Determination-EPA has determined that, as of July 27, 2007, the Franklin County ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard and that the following requirements of section 172(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to this area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1-hour ozone standard of 40 CFR 50.9: the attainment demonstration and reasonably available control measure requirements of section 172(b)(1), the reasonable further progress requirement of section 172(b)(2), and the related contingency requirements of section 172(c)(9). If a violation of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Franklin County 1-hour ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.

(n) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005.
