####### Procedure:

Identify for each deficient quarter (i.e., those with less than 11 creditable samples) the lowest reported daily value for that quarter, looking across those three months of all three years under consideration. If after substituting the lowest reported daily value for a quarter for (11- cn) daily values in the matching deficient quarter(s) (i.e., to bring the creditable number for those quarters up to 11), the procedure yields a recalculated annual PMNAAQS test DV (TDV) that is greater than the level of the standard, then the annual PMNAAQS DV is deemed to have passed the diagnostic test and is valid, and the annual PMNAAQS is deemed to have been violated in that 3-year period.

(ii) An annual PMNAAQS DV that is equal to or below the level of the NAAQS can be validated if it passes the maximum quarterly value data substitution test. This type of data substitution is permitted only if there is at least 50 percent data capture in each quarter that is deficient of 75 percent data capture in each of the three years under consideration. Data substitution will be performed in all quarter periods that have less than 75 percent data capture but at least 50 percent data capture. If any quarter has less than 50 percent data capture then this substitution test cannot be used.
