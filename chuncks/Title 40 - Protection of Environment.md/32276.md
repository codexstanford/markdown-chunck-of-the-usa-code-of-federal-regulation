() If the vessel contents are heated to the boiling point and the vessel is not operating with a condenser, the final temperature for the final increment shall be the temperature 5 K below the boiling point, even if the last increment is less than 5 K.

(iii) If the vessel is operating with a condenser, and the vessel contents are heated to the boiling point, the process condenser, as defined in ยง 63.1402, is considered part of the process. Organic HAP emissions shall be calculated as the sum of emissions calculated using Equation 10 of this section, which calculates organic HAP emissions due to heating the vessel contents to the temperature of the gas exiting the condenser, and emissions calculated using Equation 9 of this section, which calculates emissions due to the displacement of the remaining saturated noncondensible gas in the vessel. The final temperature in Equation 10 of this section shall be set equal to the exit gas temperature of the condenser. Equation 9 of this section shall be used as written below in Equation 14 of this section, using free space volume, and T is set equal to the condenser exit gas temperature:
