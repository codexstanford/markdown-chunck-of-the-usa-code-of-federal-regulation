####### R

(e) Calculate a time-weighted vehicle-pass ratio () for each pollutant. To do this, first sum the time from each valid NTE sampling event whose average emission level is at or below the NTE threshold for that pollutant, then divide this value by the sum of the engine operating time from all valid NTE events for that pollutant. Round the resulting vehicle-pass ratio to two decimal places.

(1) Calculate the time-weighted vehicle-pass ratio for each pollutant as follows:
