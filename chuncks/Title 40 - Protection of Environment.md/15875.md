####### ยง 53.63 Test procedure: Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.
######## Measure the aerosol concentration with the candidate sampler.

(3)(i) Install the candidate sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum blockage limit of ยง 53.62(c)(1) or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.

(ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the candidate sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as:

(iii) Remove the candidate sampler from the wind tunnel.

(4) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d) (2) and (d)(3) of this section. Alternately measure the tunnel concentration with the reference sampler and the candidate sampler until four reference sampler and three candidate sampler measurements of the wind tunnel concentration are obtained.
