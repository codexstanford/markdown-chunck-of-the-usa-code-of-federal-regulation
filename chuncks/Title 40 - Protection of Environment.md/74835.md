###### § 432.105 New source performance standards (NSPS).

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any source that is a new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following performance standards:

(b) The standards for BODand TSS specified in paragraph (a) of this section were derived for a renderer that does not cure cattle hide as part of the plant operations. If a renderer does cure hide, the same empirical formulas specified in § 432.107(b) should be used to calculate BODand TSS limitations for process wastewater associated with cattle hide curing that apply in addition to the standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Any source that was a new source subject to the standards specified in § 432.105 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, revised as of July 1, 2003, must continue to achieve the standards specified in this section until the expiration of the applicable time period specified in 40 CFR 122.29(d)(1) after which it must achieve the effluent limitations specified in §§ 432.103 and 432.107.
