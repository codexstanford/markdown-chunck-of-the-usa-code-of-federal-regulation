####### ยง 1065.215 Pressure transducers, temperature sensors, and dewpoint sensors.
######## Pressure.

(d)Pressure transducers must be located in a temperature-controlled environment, or they must compensate for temperature changes over their expected operating range. Transducer materials must be compatible with the fluid being measured. For atmospheric pressure or other precision pressure measurements, we recommend either capacitance-type, quartz crystal, or laser-interferometer transducers. For other applications, we recommend either strain gage or capacitance-type pressure transducers. You may use other pressure-measurement instruments, such as manometers, where appropriate.
