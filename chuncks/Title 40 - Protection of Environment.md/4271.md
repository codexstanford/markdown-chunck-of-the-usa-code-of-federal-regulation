4.1 The effects of the principal potential interferences have been minimized or eliminated in the following manner: Nitrogen oxides by the addition of sulfamic acid,() heavy metals by the addition of ethylenediamine tetracetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) and phosphoric acid,() and ozone by time delay.() Up to 60 µg Fe (III), 22 µg V (V), 10 µg Cu (II), 10 µg Mn (II), and 10 µg Cr (III) in 10 mL absorbing reagent can be tolerated in the procedure.() No significant interference has been encountered with 2.3 µg NH.()
