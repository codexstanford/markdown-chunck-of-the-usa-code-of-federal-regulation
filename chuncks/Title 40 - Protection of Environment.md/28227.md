####### Volatile organic compound

(VOC) means any organic compound which participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions, that is, any organic compound other than those which the Administrator designates as having negligible photochemical reactivity. A VOC may be measured by a reference method, an equivalent method, an alternative method, or by procedures specified under any rule. A reference method, an equivalent method, or an alternative method, however, may also measure nonreactive organic compounds. In such cases, the owner or operator may exclude the nonreactive organic compounds when determining compliance with a standard. For a list of compounds that the Administrator has designated as having negligible photochemical reactivity, refer to 40 CFR part 51.10.
