######## Cogeneration unit

means a stationary, fossil-fuel-fired boiler or stationary, fossil-fuel-fired combustion turbine that is a topping-cycle unit or a bottoming-cycle unit:

(1) Operating as part of a cogeneration system; and

(2) Producing on an annual average basis-

(i) For a topping-cycle unit,

(A) Useful thermal energy not less than 5 percent of total energy output; and

(B) Useful power that, when added to one-half of useful thermal energy produced, is not less than 42.5 percent of total energy input, if useful thermal energy produced is 15 percent or more of total energy output, or not less than 45 percent of total energy input, if useful thermal energy produced is less than 15 percent of total energy output; or

(ii) For a bottoming-cycle unit, useful power not less than 45 percent of total energy input;

(3) Provided that the requirements in paragraph (2) of this definition shall not apply to a calendar year referenced in paragraph (2) of this definition during which the unit did not operate at all;

(4) Provided that the total energy input under paragraphs (2)(i)(B) and (2)(ii) of this definition shall equal the unit's total energy input from all fuel, except biomass if the unit is a boiler; and

(5) Provided that, if, throughout its operation during the 12-month period or a calendar year referenced in paragraph (2) of this definition, a unit is operated as part of a cogeneration system and the cogeneration system meets on a system-wide basis the requirement in paragraph (2)(i)(B) or (2)(ii) of this definition, the unit shall be deemed to meet such requirement during that 12-month period or calendar year.
