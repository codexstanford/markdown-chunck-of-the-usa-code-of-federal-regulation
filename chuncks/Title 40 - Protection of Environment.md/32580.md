###### § 63.1439 General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.
####### Alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping.

(g)An owner or operator choosing not to implement the continuous parameter operating and recordkeeping provisions listed in § 63.1429 for process vents, and § 63.1433 for wastewater, may instead request approval to use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as specified in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section, and shall contain the information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.

(1) The provisions in the General Provisions requirements for the use of an alternative monitoring method in § 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review and approval of requests.

(2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter values at least once during approximately equal 15-minute intervals and that does not generate continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) The requested system shall include visual reading and recording of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than once per hour. Daily averages shall be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.

(ii) The request shall contain:

(A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping system;

(B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an automated monitoring and recording system;

(C) Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and recordkeeping system; and

(D) Demonstration that the proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent combustion, recovery, or recapture device operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific process and combustion, recovery, or recapture device operating parameter being monitored.

(3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated data compression recording system that does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once at approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes), but that records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) The requested system shall be designed to:

(A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during approximately equal 15-minute intervals;

(B) Record at least four values each hour during periods of operation;

(C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;

(D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;

(E) Calculate daily average values of the monitored operating parameter based on all measured data; and

(F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in § 63.1438(f), the data for that operating day may be converted to hourly average values and the four or more individual records for each hour in the operating day may be discarded.

(ii) The request shall contain:

(A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression recording system, including the criteria used to determine which monitored values are recorded and retained;

(B) The method for calculating daily averages; and

(C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in the General Provisions' requirements for using an alternative monitoring method in § 63.8(f)(4).
