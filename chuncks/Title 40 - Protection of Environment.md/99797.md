###### ยง 1036.535 Determining steady-state engine fuel maps and fuel consumption at idle.
####### Adjustable warm idle speed.

(i)Set the engine's warm idle speed to the next speed setpoint any time before the engine reaches the next test point. Control both speed and torque when the engine is warming up and when it is transitioning to the next test point. Start to control both speed and torque. At any time prior to reaching the next engine-idle operating point, set the engine's adjustable warm idle speed setpoint to the speed setpoint of the next engine-idle operating point in the sequence. This may be done before or during the warm-up or during the transition. Near the end of the transition period control speed and torque as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shortly before reaching each test point. Once the engine is operating at the desired speed and torque setpoints, set the operator demand to minimum; control torque so that all recorded engine torque points are within +/-25 N&#xB7;m from the target torque.
