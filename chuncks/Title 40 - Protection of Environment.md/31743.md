####### Supplemental gases

means any nonaffected gaseous streams (streams that are not from process vents, storage vessels, equipment or waste management units) that contain less than 50 ppmv TOC and less than 50 ppmv total HCl and chlorine, as determined through process knowledge, and are combined with an affected vent stream. Supplemental gases are often used to maintain pressures in manifolds or for fire and explosion protection and prevention. Air required to operate combustion device burner(s) is not considered a supplemental gas.
