####### Determination of feedstock energy content factors.,2

(7)(i) For purposes of paragraphs (f)(3)(vi) and (f)(4)(i)(A)() of this section, producers must specify the value for E, the energy content of the components of the feedstock that are converted to renewable fuel, used in the calculation of the feedstock energy value FE.

(ii) The value for E shall represent the higher or gross calorific heating value for a feedstock on a zero moisture basis.

(iii) Producers must specify the value for E for each type of feedstock at least once per calendar year.

(iv) A producer must use default values for E as provided in paragraph (f)(7)(vi) of this section, or must determine alternative values for its own feedstocks according to paragraph (f)(7)(v) of this section.

(v) Producers that do not use a default value for E must use the following test methods, or alternative test methods as approved by EPA, to determine the value of E. The value of E shall be based upon the test results of a sample of feedstock that, based upon good engineering judgment, is representative of the feedstocks used to produce renewable fuel:

(A) ASTM E870 or ASTM E711 for gross calorific value (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 80.1468).

(B) ASTM D4442 or ASTM D4444 for moisture content (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 80.1468).
