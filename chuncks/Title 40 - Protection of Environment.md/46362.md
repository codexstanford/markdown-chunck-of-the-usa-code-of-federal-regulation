###### ยง 86.079-32 Addition of a vehicle or engine after certification.

(a) If a manufacturer proposes to add to his product line a vehicle (or engine) of the same engine-system combination as vehicles (or engines) previously certified but which was not described in the application for certification when the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) representing other vehicles (or engines) of that combination was certified, he shall notify the Administrator. Such notification shall be in advance of the addition unless the manufacturer elects to follow the procedure described in ยง 86.079-34. This notification shall include a full description of the vehicle (or engine) to be added.

(b) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to perform such tests on the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) representing the vehicle (or engine) to be added which would have been required if the vehicle (or engine) had been included in the original application for certification.

(c) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manufacturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under ยง 86.079-29, the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) or test engine(s) meets all applicable standards, the appropriate certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) does not meet applicable standards, he will proceed under ยง 86.079-30(b).
