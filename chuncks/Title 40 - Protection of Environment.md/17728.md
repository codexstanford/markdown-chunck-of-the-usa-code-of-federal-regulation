###### § 60.49b Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
####### i.e.

(1) Indicating what removal efficiency by fuel pretreatment (, %R) was credited during the reporting period;

(2) Listing the quantity, heat content, and date each pre-treated fuel shipment was received during the reporting period, the name and location of the fuel pretreatment facility; and the total quantity and total heat content of all fuels received at the affected facility during the reporting period;

(3) Documenting the transport of the fuel from the fuel pretreatment facility to the steam generating unit; and

(4) Including a signed statement from the owner or operator of the fuel pretreatment facility certifying that the percent removal efficiency achieved by fuel pretreatment was determined in accordance with the provisions of Method 19 of appendix A of this part and listing the heat content and sulfur content of each fuel before and after fuel pretreatment.

(o) All records required under this section shall be maintained by the owner or operator of the affected facility for a period of 2 years following the date of such record.

(p) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in § 60.44b(j) or (k) shall maintain records of the following information for each steam generating unit operating day:

(1) Calendar date;

(2) The number of hours of operation; and

(3) A record of the hourly steam load.

(q) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in § 60.44b(j) or § 60.44b(k) shall submit to the Administrator a report containing:

(1) The annual capacity factor over the previous 12 months;

(2) The average fuel nitrogen content during the reporting period, if residual oil was fired; and

(3) If the affected facility meets the criteria described in § 60.44b(j), the results of any NOemission tests required during the reporting period, the hours of operation during the reporting period, and the hours of operation since the last NOemission test.

(r) The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to use the fuel based compliance alternatives in § 60.42b or § 60.43b shall either:

(1) The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to demonstrate that the affected facility combusts only very low sulfur oil, natural gas, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or any of these fuels (or a mixture of these fuels) in combination with other fuels that are known to contain an insignificant amount of sulfur in § 60.42b(j) or § 60.42b(k) shall obtain and maintain at the affected facility fuel receipts (such as a current, valid purchase contract, tariff sheet, or transportation contract) from the fuel supplier that certify that the oil meets the definition of distillate oil and gaseous fuel meets the definition of natural gas as defined in § 60.41b and the applicable sulfur limit. For the purposes of this section, the distillate oil need not meet the fuel nitrogen content specification in the definition of distillate oil. Reports shall be submitted to the Administrator certifying that only very low sulfur oil meeting this definition, natural gas, wood, and/or other fuels that are known to contain insignificant amounts of sulfur were combusted in the affected facility during the reporting period; or

(2) The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to demonstrate compliance based on fuel analysis in § 60.42b or § 60.43b shall develop and submit a site-specific fuel analysis plan to the Administrator for review and approval no later than 60 days before the date you intend to demonstrate compliance. Each fuel analysis plan shall include a minimum initial requirement of weekly testing and each analysis report shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:

(i) The potential sulfur emissions rate of the representative fuel mixture in ng/J heat input;

(ii) The method used to determine the potential sulfur emissions rate of each constituent of the mixture. For distillate oil and natural gas a fuel receipt or tariff sheet is acceptable;

(iii) The ratio of different fuels in the mixture; and

(iv) The owner or operator can petition the Administrator to approve monthly or quarterly sampling in place of weekly sampling.
