######## Design efficiency,e.g.,,e.g.,

means the rated overall net efficiency (electric plus useful thermal output) on a lower heating value basis at the base load rating, at ISO conditions, and at the maximum useful thermal output (CHP unit with condensing steam turbines would determine the design efficiency at the maximum level of extraction and/or bypass). Design efficiency shall be determined using one of the following methods: ASME PTC 22 Gas Turbines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 60.17), ASME PTC 46 Overall Plant Performance (incorporated by reference, see ยง 60.17) or ISO 2314 Gas turbines-acceptance tests (incorporated by reference, see ยง 60.17).
