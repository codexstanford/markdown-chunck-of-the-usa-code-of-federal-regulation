###### Calculation of toxicity/mobility/persistence/ bioaccumulation factor value.

4.2.3.2.1.5Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from table 3-9 (section 3.2.1.3), based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value from table 4-26, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/mobility and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from table 4-28. Use the substance with the highest toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.
