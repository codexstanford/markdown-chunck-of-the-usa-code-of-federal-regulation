######## Sampling plan.

(iii)If you have been expressly referred to this paragraph by provisions of this subpart, you shall prepare a sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sampling plan shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant organic HAP. An example of an example sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. You shall maintain the sampling plan at the facility.
