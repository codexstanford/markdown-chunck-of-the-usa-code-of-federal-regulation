(iii) Calculate your corrected drag area for determining the aerodynamic bin by multiplying the measured zero-yaw drag area by, as determined using Eq. 1037.525-4, as applicable. You may apply the correction factor to drag areas measured using other procedures. For example, applyto drag areas measured using the coastdown method. If you use an alternate method, apply an alternate correction,, and calculate the final drag area using the following equation:
