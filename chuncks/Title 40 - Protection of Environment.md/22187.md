###### 6.2.3 Sample Line.

The sample line from the probe to the conditioning system/sample pump should be made of Teflon or other material that does not absorb or otherwise alter the sample gas. For a dry-basis measurement system (as shown in Figure 7E-1), the temperature of the sample line must be maintained at a sufficiently high level to prevent condensation before the sample conditioning components. For wet-basis measurement systems, the temperature of the sample line must be maintained at a sufficiently high level to prevent condensation before the analyzer.
