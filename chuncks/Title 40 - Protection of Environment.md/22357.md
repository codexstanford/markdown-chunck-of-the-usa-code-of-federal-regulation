###### 7.2 Adsorbent Resin. Amberlite&#xAE; XAD-2 resin.

All adsorbent resin must meet the cleanliness criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method following the same extraction, concentration, cleanup, and analysis steps as field samples. This method recommends using the procedures provided in Appendix B to this method to clean the resin before use, if needed. However, this method allows alternative cleanup procedures that use automated extraction equipment if the adsorbent meets the required performance criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method.

7.2.1 Conduct a QC check on the cleaned adsorbent lot or batch following the extraction and analyses procedures in Section 11 of this method, including adding applicable labeled standards. The cleaned adsorbent must meet the criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method. An LMB conducted with an adsorbent lot or batch can serve this purpose.

7.2.2 Storage. Store adsorbent in a solvent-rinsed nonporous clean container and secure lid.
