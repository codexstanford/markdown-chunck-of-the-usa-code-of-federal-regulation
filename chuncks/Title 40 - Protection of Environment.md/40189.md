###### Determine Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainties.

4.8Using appendix E of this addendum, calculate the fractional reproducibility uncertainty for each analyte (FRU) from a comparison of [R1] and [R2]. If FRU>AUfor any analyte, the reference spectra generated in accordance with section 4.6 of this addendum are not valid for the application.
