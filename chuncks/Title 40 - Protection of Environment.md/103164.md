(b)Calculate the mass of carbon in the intake air,, for each test interval using one of the methods in this paragraph (b). The methods are listed in order of preference. Use the first method where all the inputs are available for your test configuration. For methods that calculatebased on the amount of COper mole of intake air, we recommend measuring intake air concentration, but you may calculateusing Eq. 1065.655-10 and letting= 375 µmol/mol.
