###### State or community initiated emission offsets.

B.A State or community which desires that a source locate in its area may commit to reducing emissions from existing sources (including mobile sources) to sufficiently outweigh the impact of the new source and thus open the way for the new source. As with source-initiated emission offsets, the commitment must be something more than one-for-one. This commitment must be submitted as a SIP revision by the State.
