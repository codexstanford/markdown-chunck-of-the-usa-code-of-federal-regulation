####### CFV calibration.,K,K

(c)Some CFV flow meters consist of a single venturi and some consist of multiple venturis where different combinations of venturis are used to meter different flow rates. For CFV flow meters that consist of multiple venturis, either calibrate each venturi independently to determine a separate calibration coefficient,, for each venturi, or calibrate each combination of venturis as one venturi by determiningfor the system.
