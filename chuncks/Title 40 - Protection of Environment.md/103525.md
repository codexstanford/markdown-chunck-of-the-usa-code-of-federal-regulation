######## et al,

(a) The procedure is adapted from "Behavior of Titania-supported Vanadia and Tungsta SCR Catalysts at High Temperatures in Reactant Streams: Tungsten and Vanadium Oxide and Hydroxide Vapor Pressure Reduction by Surficial Stabilization" (Chapman, D.M., Applied Catalysis A: General, 2011, 392, 143-150) with modifications to the acid digestion method from "Measuring the trace elemental composition of size-resolved airborne particles" (Herner, J.D.Environmental Science and Technology, 2006, 40, 1925-1933).

(b) Laboratory cleanliness is especially important throughout vanadium testing. Thoroughly clean all sampling system components and glassware before testing to avoid sample contamination.
