() The monthly emission rate of organic HAP, in kilograms per month, from an individual batch process vent (E) shall be determined using Equation 3 of this section. Once organic HAP emissions for a batch cycle (E) have been estimated, as specified in either paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C)() or () of this section, the owner or operator may use the estimated organic HAP emissions (E) to determine Eusing Equation 3 of this section until the estimated organic HAP emissions (E) are no longer representative due to a process change or other reasons known to the owner or operator.
