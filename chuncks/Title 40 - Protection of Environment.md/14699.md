###### ยง 52.2037 Control strategy plans for attainment and rate-of-progress: Ozone.
####### Determination of attainment.

(s)EPA has determined, as of April 4, 2013, that based on 2009 to 2011 ambient air quality data, the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, PA moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

(t) On July 14, 2012, Pennsylvania repealed the provisions set forth in Sections 130.101 through 130.108 pertaining to Portable Fuel Containers. Pennsylvania's regulations in the Pennsylvania State Implementation Plan were removed because they are superseded by more stringent Federal requirements codified at 40 CFR 59.600 through 59.699, relating to control of evaporative emissions from new and in-use portable fuel containers.
