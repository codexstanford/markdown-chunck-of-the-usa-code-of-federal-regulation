####### ยง 63.7575 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Steam output

means:

(1) For a boiler that produces steam for process or heating only (no power generation), the energy content in terms of MMBtu of the boiler steam output,

(2) For a boiler that cogenerates process steam and electricity (also known as combined heat and power), the total energy output, which is the sum of the energy content of the steam exiting the turbine and sent to process in MMBtu and the energy of the electricity generated converted to MMBtu at a rate of 10,000 Btu per kilowatt-hour generated (10 MMBtu per megawatt-hour), and

(3) For a boiler that generates only electricity, the alternate output-based emission limits would be the appropriate emission limit from Table 1, 2, 14, or 15 to this subpart in units of pounds per million Btu heat input (lb per MWh).

(4) For a boiler that performs multiple functions and produces steam to be used for any combination of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this definition that includes electricity generation of paragraph (3) of this definition, the total energy output, in terms of MMBtu of steam output, is the sum of the energy content of steam sent directly to the process and/or used for heating (S), the energy content of turbine steam sent to process plus energy in electricity according to paragraph (2) of this definition (S), and the energy content of electricity generated by a electricity only turbine as paragraph (3) of this definition (MW) and would be calculated using Equation 1 to this definition. In the case of boilers supplying steam to one or more common headers, S, S, and MWfor each boiler would be calculated based on its (steam energy) contribution (fraction of total steam energy) to the common header.
