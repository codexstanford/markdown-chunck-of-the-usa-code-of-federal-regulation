#### PART 162 - STATE REGISTRATION OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS
##### Subpart D - Regulations Pertaining to State Registration of Pesticides To Meet Special Local Needs
###### § 162.152 State registration authority.
####### Effect of State registration.

(c)(1) A State registration issued under FIFRA sec. 24(c) which meets the conditions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and which is not disapproved by the Administrator under § 162.154, shall be considered a federal registration, but shall authorize distribution and use only within that State. Accordingly, such registrations are subject to all provisions of FIFRA which apply to currently registered products, including provisions for cancellation and suspension of registrations, and reregistration of products.

(2) A State may require, as a condition of distribution or use of a pesticide product within the State, that the pesticide product be registered under State law as well as under FIFRA. Neither FIFRA sec. 24(c) nor §§ 162.150-162.156 affects a State's right under its own law to revoke, suspend, cancel, or otherwise affect such a registration issued under State law. However, the federal registration, whether issued under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24(c), is not affected by such a State action.
