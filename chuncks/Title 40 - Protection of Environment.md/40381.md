#### PART 64 - COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE MONITORING
##### ยง 64.2 Applicability.
###### General applicability.

(a)Except for backup utility units that are exempt under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the requirements of this part shall apply to a pollutant-specific emissions unit at a major source that is required to obtain a part 70 or 71 permit if the unit satisfies all of the following criteria:

(1) The unit is subject to an emission limitation or standard for the applicable regulated air pollutant (or a surrogate thereof), other than an emission limitation or standard that is exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

(2) The unit uses a control device to achieve compliance with any such emission limitation or standard; and

(3) The unit has potential pre-control device emissions of the applicable regulated air pollutant that are equal to or greater than 100 percent of the amount, in tons per year, required for a source to be classified as a major source. For purposes of this paragraph, "potential pre-control device emissions" shall have the same meaning as "potential to emit," as defined in ยง 64.1, except that emission reductions achieved by the applicable control device shall not be taken into account.
