####### § 63.4961 How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
######## Compliance demonstration.

(m)To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limit during the compliance period as calculated using Equation 4 of this section, the HAP emission rate for the compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4930 and 63.4931. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4910 and the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.4920, you must identify the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limit, include a statement that the coating operation or group of coating operations was in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.4892 and the work practice standards required by § 63.4893.
