10.1 Determine the average sampler flow rate during the sampling period according to either 10.1.1 or 10.1.2 below.

10.1.1 For a sampler without a continuous flow recorder, determine the appropriate expression to be used from table 2 corresponding to the one from table 1 used in step 9.3.9. Using this appropriate expression, determine Qfor the initial flow rate from the sampler calibration curve, either graphically or from the transposed regression equation:

10.1.2 For a sampler with a continuous flow recorder, determine the average flow rate device reading, I, for the period. Determine the appropriate expression from table 2 corresponding to the one from table 1 used in step 9.3.9. Then using this expression and the average flow rate reading, determine Qfrom the sampler calibration curve, either graphically or from the transposed regression equation:

If the trace shows substantial flow change during the sampling period, greater accuracy may be achieved by dividing the sampling period into intervals and calculating an average reading before determining Q.

10.2 Calculate the total air volume sampled as:

10.3 Calculate and report the particulate matter concentration as:

10.4 If desired, the actual particulate matter concentration (see Section 2.2) can be calculated as follows:
