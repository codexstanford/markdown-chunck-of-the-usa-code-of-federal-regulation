####### Minor change to test method

means:

(1) A modification to a federally enforceable test method that:

(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the emission limitation or standard;

(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation in this part for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the test method); and

(iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.

(2) Examples of minor changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:

(i) Field adjustments in a test method's sampling procedure, such as a modified sampling traverse or location to avoid interference from an obstruction in the stack, increasing the sampling time or volume, use of additional impingers for a high moisture situation, accepting particulate emission results for a test run that was conducted with a lower than specified temperature, substitution of a material in the sampling train that has been demonstrated to be more inert for the sample matrix; and

(ii) Changes in recovery and analytical techniques such as a change in quality control/quality assurance requirements needed to adjust for analysis of a certain sample matrix.
