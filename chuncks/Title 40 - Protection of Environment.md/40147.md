###### Background Spectrum.

8.5Evacuate the gas cell to &#x2264;5 mmHg, and fill with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure (or purge the cell with 10 volumes of dry nitrogen). Verify that no significant amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and CO) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background spectrum. Store two copies of the background interferogram and processed single-beam spectrum on separate computer disks (one copy is the back-up).
