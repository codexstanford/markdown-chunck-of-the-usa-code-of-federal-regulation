####### ยง 53.56 Test for effect of variations in ambient pressure.
######## Mean sample flow rate.

(1)(i) From the certified measurements (Q) of the test sampler flow rate, tabulate each flow rate measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow rate for the sample period (Q) as follows:

(ii)(A) Calculate the percent difference between this mean flow rate value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:

(B) To successfully pass this test, the percent difference calculated in Equation 18 of this paragraph (g)(1) must be within +/-5 percent for each test run.
