######## Vacuum-decay leak test.
########## Exceptions.

(e)The following exceptions apply:

(1) You may omit this verification if you can show by engineering analysis that for your COsampling system and your emission-calculation procedures, the HO interference for your CONDIR analyzer always affects your brake-specific emission results within +/-0.5% of each of the applicable standards in this chapter. This specification also applies for vehicle testing, except that it relates to emission results in g/mile or g/kilometer.

(2) You may use a CONDIR analyzer that you determine does not meet this verification, as long as you try to correct the problem and the measurement deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to show that engines comply with all applicable emission standards.
