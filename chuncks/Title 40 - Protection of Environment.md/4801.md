##### Appendix U to Part 50 - Interpretation of the Primary and Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone
###### i.e.,

(a) The primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards for Oare met at an ambient air quality monitoring site when the 3-year average of the annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentration (the design value) is less than or equal to 0.070 ppm.

(b) A design value greater than the level of the NAAQS is always considered to be valid. A design value less than or equal to the level of the NAAQS must meet minimum data completeness requirements in order to be considered valid. These requirements are met for a 3-year period at a site if valid daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentrations are available for at least 90% of the days within the Omonitoring season, on average, for the 3-year period, with a minimum of at least 75% of the days within the Omonitoring season in any one year.

(c) When computing whether the minimum data completeness requirements have been met, meteorological or ambient data may be sufficient to demonstrate that meteorological conditions on missing days were not conducive to concentrations above the level of the NAAQS. Missing days assumed less than the level of the NAAQS are counted for the purpose of meeting the minimum data completeness requirements, subject to the approval of the appropriate Regional Administrator.

(d) Comparisons with the primary and secondary ONAAQS are demonstrated by examples 1 and 2 as follows:
