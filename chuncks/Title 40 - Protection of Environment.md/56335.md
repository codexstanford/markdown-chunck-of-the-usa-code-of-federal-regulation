###### § 141.403 Treatment technique requirements for ground water systems.
####### Ground water systems with significant deficiencies or source water fecal contamination.

(a)(1) The treatment technique requirements of this section must be met by ground water systems when a significant deficiency is identified or when a ground water source sample collected under § 141.402(a)(3) is fecal indicator-positive.

(2) If directed by the State, a ground water system with a ground water source sample collected under § 141.402(a)(2), § 141.402(a)(4), or § 141.402(b) that is fecal indicator-positive must comply with the treatment technique requirements of this section.

(3) When a significant deficiency is identified at a Subpart H public water system that uses both ground water and surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water, the system must comply with provisions of this paragraph except in cases where the State determines that the significant deficiency is in a portion of the distribution system that is served solely by surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water.

(4) Unless the State directs the ground water system to implement a specific corrective action, the ground water system must consult with the State regarding the appropriate corrective action within 30 days of receiving written notice from the State of a significant deficiency, written notice from a laboratory that a ground water source sample collected under § 141.402(a)(3) was found to be fecal indicator-positive, or direction from the State that a fecal indicator'positive collected under § 141.402(a)(2), § 141.402(a)(4), or § 141.402(b) requires corrective action. For the purposes of this subpart, significant deficiencies include, but are not limited to, defects in design, operation, or maintenance, or a failure or malfunction of the sources, treatment, storage, or distribution system that the State determines to be causing, or have potential for causing, the introduction of contamination into the water delivered to consumers.

(5) Within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the State) of receiving written notification from the State of a significant deficiency, written notice from a laboratory that a ground water source sample collected under § 141.402(a)(3) was found to be fecal indicator-positive, or direction from the State that a fecal indicator-positive sample collected under § 141.402(a)(2), § 141.402(a)(4), or § 141.402(b) requires corrective action, the ground water system must either:

(i) Have completed corrective action in accordance with applicable State plan review processes or other State guidance or direction, if any, including State-specified interim measures; or

(ii) Be in compliance with a State-approved corrective action plan and schedule subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(A) and (a)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.

(A) Any subsequent modifications to a State-approved corrective action plan and schedule must also be approved by the State.

(B) If the State specifies interim measures for protection of the public health pending State approval of the corrective action plan and schedule or pending completion of the corrective action plan, the system must comply with these interim measures as well as with any schedule specified by the State.
