####### Test procedures,Summary of the test.

(c)-(1)In preparation for the test, test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. If a flow-through test is performed, the flow of dilution water through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. The test substance is introduced into each test chamber. In a flow-through test, the rate at which the test substance is added is adjusted to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in each test chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing mysids acclimated in accordance with the test design into the test chambers. Mysids in the test chambers are observed periodically during the test, the dead mysids removed and the findings recorded. Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, salinity, the concentration of test substance, and other water quality characteristics are measured at specified intervals in test chambers. Data collected during the test are used to develop concentration-response curves and LCvalues for the test substance.
