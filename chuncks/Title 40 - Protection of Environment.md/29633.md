####### Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.

(2)Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in ยง 63.1110(h).
