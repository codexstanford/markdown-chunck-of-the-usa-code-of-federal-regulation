## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter F - Radiation Protection Programs
#### PART 191 - ENVIRONMENTAL RADIATION PROTECTION STANDARDS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL, HIGH-LEVEL AND TRANSURANIC RADIOACTIVE WASTES
##### Appendix C to Part 191 - Guidance for Implementation of Subpart B
###### Compliance with ยง 191.13.

The Agency assumes that, whenever practicable, the implementing agency will assemble all of the results of the performance assessments to determine compliance with ยง 191.13 into a "complementary cumulative distribution function" that indicates the probability of exceeding various levels of cumulative release. When the uncertainties in parameters are considered in a performance assessment, the effects of the uncertainties considered can be incorporated into a single such distribution function for each disposal system considered. The Agency assumes that a disposal system can be considered to be in compliance with ยง 191.13 if this single distribution function meets the requirements of ยง 191.13(a).
