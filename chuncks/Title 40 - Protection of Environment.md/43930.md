####### Producers.

(b)Any RIN-generating foreign producer, any non-RIN-generating foreign producer, any domestic renewable fuel producer that generates RINs, or any biointermediate producer that transfers any biointermediate for the production of a renewable fuel for RIN generation, must provide EPA the information specified under 40 CFR 1090.805 if such information has not already been provided under the provisions of this part, and must receive EPA-issued company and facility identification numbers prior to the generation of any RINs for their fuel or for fuel made with their ethanol, or prior to the transfer of any biointermediate to be used in the production of a renewable fuel for which RINs may be generated. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all the following registration information must be submitted to EPA at least 60 days prior to the intended generation of RINs or the intended transfer of any biointermediate to be used in the production of a renewable fuel for which RINs may be generated. Renewable fuel producers may generate RINs for a renewable fuel under this part after EPA has accepted their registration and they have met all other applicable requirements under this part.

(1) A description of the types of renewable fuels, ethanol, or biointermediates that the producer intends to produce at the facility and that the facility is capable of producing without significant modifications to the existing facility. For each type of renewable fuel, ethanol, or biointermediate the renewable fuel producer or foreign ethanol producer must also provide all the following:

(i)(A) A list of all the feedstocks and biointermediates the facility intends to utilize without significant modification to the existing facility.

(B) A description of the type(s) of renewable biomass that will be used as feedstock material to produce the biointermediate, if applicable.

(C) A list of the EPA-issued company and facility registration numbers of all biointermediate producers and biointermediate production facilities that will supply biointermediates for renewable fuel production.

(ii) A description of the facility's renewable fuel, ethanol, or biointermediate production processes, including:

(A) For registrations indicating production of cellulosic biofuel (D codes 3 or 7) from feedstocks other than biogas (including through pathways in rows K, L, M, and N of Table 1 to ยง 80.1426), the producer must demonstrate the ability to convert cellulosic components of feedstock into fuel by providing all of the following:
