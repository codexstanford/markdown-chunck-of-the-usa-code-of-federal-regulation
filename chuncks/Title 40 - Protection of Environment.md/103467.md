####### Test interval

means a duration of time over which you determine mass of emissions. For example, the standard-setting part may specify a complete laboratory duty cycle as a cold-start test interval, plus a hot-start test interval. As another example, a standard-setting part may specify a field-test interval, such as a "not-to-exceed" (NTE) event, as a duration of time over which an engine operates within a certain range of speed and torque. In cases where multiple test intervals occur over a duty cycle, the standard-setting part may specify additional calculations that weight and combine results to arrive at composite values for comparison against the applicable standards in this chapter.
