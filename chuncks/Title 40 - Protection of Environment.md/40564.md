###### ยง 65.5 Reporting requirements.
####### Request for adjustment.

(2)An owner or operator may arrange by mutual agreement (which may be a standing agreement) with the Administrator a common schedule on which periodic reports required by this part shall be submitted throughout the year as long as the reporting period is not extended. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practical before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted. A request for a change to the periodic reporting schedule need only be made once for every schedule change and not once for every semiannual report submitted.
