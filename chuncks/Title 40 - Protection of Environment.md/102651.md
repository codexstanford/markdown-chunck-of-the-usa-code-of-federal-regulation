######## Exhaust cooling.

(d)You may cool diluted exhaust upstream of a dilute-exhaust flow meter, as long as you observe all the following provisions:

(1) Do not sample PM downstream of the cooling.

(2) If cooling causes exhaust temperatures above 202 &#xB0;C to decrease to below 180 &#xB0;C, do not sample NMHC downstream of the cooling for compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, or four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW.

(3) The cooling must not cause aqueous condensation as described in ยง 1065.140(c)(6).
