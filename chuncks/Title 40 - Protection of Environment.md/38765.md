######## Monitoring requirements.

(b)(1) You must install, operate, and maintain a PM continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to measure and record PM concentrations and gas stream flow rates for the exhaust gases discharged to the atmosphere from each affected source subject to the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A single PM CEMS may be used for the combined exhaust gas streams from multiple affected sources at a point before the gases are discharged to the atmosphere. For each PM CEMS used to comply with this paragraph, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) You must install, certify, operate, and maintain the PM CEMS according to EPA Performance Specification 11 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and the quality assurance requirements of Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.

(ii) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of the PM CEMS according to the requirements of Performance Specification 11 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. Thereafter, you must perform the performance evaluations as required by Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.

(iii) You must perform quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests for the PM CEMS according to Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.

(2) You must install, operate, and maintain a weight measurement system to measure and record the weight of the copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel on a daily basis.
