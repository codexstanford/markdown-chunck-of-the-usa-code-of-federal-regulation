####### Net heating value

means the difference between the heat value of the recovered chemical stream and the minimum heat value required to ensure a stable flame in the combustion device. This difference must have a positive value when used in the context of "recovering chemicals for fuel value" (e.g., in the definition of "recovery device" in this section).
