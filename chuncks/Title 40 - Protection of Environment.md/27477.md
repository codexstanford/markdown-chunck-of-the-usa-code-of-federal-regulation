####### e.g.

(ii) If continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and engineering calculations are used as allowed under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, at a minimum, determine the 15-minute block average temperature and pressure from the monitoring system and use those values to perform the engineering calculations to determine the cumulative flow over the 15-minute block average period. Alternatively, the owner or operator may divide the 15-minute block average period into equal duration subperiods(, three 5-minute periods) and determine the average temperature and pressure for each subperiod, perform engineering calculations to determine the flow for each subperiod, then add the volumetric flows for the subperiods to determine the cumulative volumetric flow of vent gas for the 15-minute block average period.

(3) The 15-minute block average Vshall be calculated using the following equation.

(4) If the owner or operator chooses to comply with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall also determine the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the requirements in paragraphs (j) and (l) of this section and calculate Vusing the equation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in order to compare Vto Von a 15-minute block average basis.
