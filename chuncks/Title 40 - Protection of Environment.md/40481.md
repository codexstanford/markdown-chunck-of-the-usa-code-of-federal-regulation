####### Minor change to monitoring

means:

(1) A modification to federally required monitoring that:

(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures of the relevant standard;

(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation in this part for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the monitoring requirements); and

(iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.

(2) Examples of minor changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:

(i) Modifications to a sampling procedure, such as use of an improved sample conditioning system to reduce maintenance requirements;

(ii) Increased monitoring frequency; and

(iii) Modification of the environmental shelter to moderate temperature fluctuation and thus protect the analytical instrumentation.
