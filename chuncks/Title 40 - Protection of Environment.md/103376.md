####### Brake power

has the meaning given in the standard-setting part. If it is not defined in the standard-setting part, brake power means the usable power output of the engine, not including power required to fuel, lubricate, or heat the engine, circulate coolant to the engine, or to operate aftertreatment devices. If the engine does not power these accessories during a test, subtract the work required to perform these functions from the total work used in brake-specific emission calculations. Subtract engine fan work from total work only for air-cooled engines.
