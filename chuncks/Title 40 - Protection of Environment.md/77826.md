(6) The sub-heading "Driving Range" below the combined fuel economy value. Below this sub-heading, insert a horizontal range bar nominally 80 mm long to show how far the vehicle can drive when fully fueled. Include a vehicle logo at the right end of the range bar. Include the following left-justified expression inside the range bar: "When fully charged, vehicle can travel about * * *". Below the right end of the range bar, include the expression "miles"; complete the expression by identifying the appropriate value for total driving range from ยง 600.311. Include numbers below the bar showing the scale, with numbers starting at 0 and increasing in equal increments. Use good engineering judgment to divide the range bar into four, five, or six increments.
