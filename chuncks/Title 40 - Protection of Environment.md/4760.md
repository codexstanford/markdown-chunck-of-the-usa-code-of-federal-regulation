(e) The site-level design value for a 38-month period (three calendar years plus two previous months) is identified from the available (between one and 36) valid 3-month site means. In a situation where there are valid 3-month means for both parameters (Pb-TSP and Pb-PM), the mean originating from the reported Pb-TSP data will be the one deemed the site-level monthly mean and used in design value identifications unless the Pb-PMmean shows a violation of the NAAQS and exceeds the Pb-TSP mean; see section 2(a) for details. A monitoring site will have only one site-level 3-month mean per 3-month period; however, the set of site-level 3-month means considered for design value identification (, one to 36 site-level 3-month means) can be a combination of Pb-TSP and Pb-PMdata.

(f) The procedures for calculating monthly means and 3-month means, and identifying Pb design values are given in section 6 of this appendix.
