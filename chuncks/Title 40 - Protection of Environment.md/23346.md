####### Reconsideration of rescission of this subpart initiated by the Administrator.

(c)(1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m-s flux standard.

(2) Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart under ยง 61.226(c)(1), EPA shall consult with NRC to address EPA's concerns and if the consultation does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to reinstate this subpart.
