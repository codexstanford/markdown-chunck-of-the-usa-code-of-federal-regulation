###### ยง 52.324 Legal authority.

(a) The requirements of ยง 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks the authority to require owners or operators of stationary sources to install, maintain, and use emission monitoring devices and to make periodic reports to the State on the nature and amounts of emissions from such stationary sources.

(b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, Colorado requested a delegation of authority to enable it to require sources to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions. The Administrator has determined that Colorado is qualified to receive a delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to Colorado his authority under section 114(a)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act, i.e., authority to require sources within the State of Colorado to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions.
