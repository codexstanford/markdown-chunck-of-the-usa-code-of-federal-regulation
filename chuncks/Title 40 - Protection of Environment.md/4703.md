###### i.e.

As shown in Example 2, the primary and secondary Ostandards are not met for this monitoring site because the 3-year average of the fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentrations (, 0.096333 * * * ppm, truncated to 0.096 ppm) is greater than 0.075 ppm, even though the data capture is less than 75% and the average data capture for the 3 years is less than 90% within the required monitoring season. In Example 2, the individual 8-hour averages used to determine the annual fourth maximum have also been truncated to the third decimal place.

The air quality design value at a monitoring site is defined as that concentration that when reduced to the level of the standard ensures that the site meets the standard. For a concentration-based standard, the air quality design value is simply the standard-related test statistic. Thus, for the primary and secondary standards, the 3-year average annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentration is also the air quality design value for the site.
