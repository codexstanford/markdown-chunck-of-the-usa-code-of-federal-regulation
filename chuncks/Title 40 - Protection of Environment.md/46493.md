####### Family emission limit

(FEL) means an emission level declared by the manufacturer which serves in lieu of an emission standard for certification purposes in any of the averaging, trading, or banking programs. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicable emission standard. The FEL for an engine family using NOor particulate NCPs must equal the value of the current NOor particulate emission standard.
