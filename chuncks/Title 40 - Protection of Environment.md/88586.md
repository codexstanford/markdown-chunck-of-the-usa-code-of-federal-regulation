(i)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.63(a)(4), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(v), (a)(6)(vi), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for ยง 721.63(a)(4), engineering control measures (enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an Assigned Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 meet the requirements of ยง 721.63(a)(4):

(A) NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.

(B) NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting face piece, hood, or helmet.

(C) NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full face piece. As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 5 mg/mas an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.
