####### Tissue distribution time course.

(2)(i) A time course of tissue distribution in selected tissues may be required to aid in the determination of a possible mode of toxic action. This concern may arise from evidence of extended half-life or possible accumulation of radioactivity in specific tissues. The selection of tissues for this type of study will be based upon available evidence of target organ toxicity and/or carcinogenicity, and the number of time points required will be based upon pharmacokinetic information obtained from Tier 1 data. Flexibility will be allowed in the selection of time points to be studied.

(ii) For this type of study, three rats per time point will be administered an appropriate oral dose of test chemical, and the time course of distribution monitored in selected tissues. Only one sex may be required, unless target organ toxicity is observed in sex-specific organs. Assessment of tissue distribution will be made using appropriate techniques for assessment of total amount distributed to tissue and for assessment of metabolite distribution.
