####### Coverage Factor k,i.e.,,i.e.,

means, in general, a value chosen on the basis of the desired level of confidence to be associated with the interval defined by U = ku. Typically, k is in the range 2 to 3. When the normal distribution applies and uis a reliable estimate of the standard deviation of y, U = 2 u(k = 2) defines an interval having a level of confidence of approximately 95%, and U = 3 u(k = 3) defines an interval having a level of confidence greater than 99%.
