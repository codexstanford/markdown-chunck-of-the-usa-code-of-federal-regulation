#### PART 1090 - REGULATION OF FUELS, FUEL ADDITIVES, AND REGULATED BLENDSTOCKS
##### Subpart R - Compliance and Enforcement Provisions
###### ยง 1090.1720 Affirmative defense provisions.
####### e.g.,

(ii) Promptly remedies the violation and the factors that caused the violation (by removing the non-complying fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock from the distribution system until the applicable standard is achieved and taking steps to prevent future violations of a similar nature from occurring).

(3) For any carrier that transports a fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock in a tank truck, the periodic sampling and testing program required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not need to include periodic sampling and testing of gasoline in the tank truck. In lieu of such tank truck sampling and testing, the carrier must demonstrate evidence of an oversight program for monitoring compliance with the requirements of this part relating to the transport or storage of the fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock by tank truck, such as appropriate guidance to drivers regarding compliance with the applicable per-gallon standards and PTD requirements, and the periodic review of records received in the ordinary course of business concerning gasoline quality and delivery.

(e) In addition to the defenses provided in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, in any case in which an oxygenate blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer, or WPC would be in violation under ยง 1090.1715 as a result of gasoline that contains between 9 and 15 percent ethanol (by volume) but exceeds the applicable standard by more than 1.0 psi, the oxygenate blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer, or WPC will not be deemed in violation if such person can demonstrate, by showing receipt of a certification from the facility from which the gasoline was received or other evidence acceptable to EPA, all the following:

(1) The gasoline portion of the blend complies with the applicable RVP standard in ยง 1090.215.

(2) The ethanol portion of the blend does not exceed 15 percent (by volume).

(3) No additional alcohol or other additive has been added to increase the RVP of the ethanol portion of the blend.

(4) In the case of a violation alleged against an oxygenate blender, distributor, reseller, or carrier, if the demonstration required by paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section is made by a certification, it must be supported by evidence that the criteria in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section have been met, such as an oversight program conducted by or on behalf of the oxygenate blender, distributor, reseller, or carrier alleged to be in violation, which includes periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline or monitoring the volatility and ethanol content of the gasoline. Such certification will be deemed sufficient evidence of compliance provided it is not contradicted by specific evidence, such as testing results, and provided that the party has no other reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certification are inaccurate. In the case of a violation alleged against a retail outlet or WPC facility, such certification will be deemed an adequate defense for the retailer or WPC, provided that the retailer or WPC is able to show certificates for all the gasoline contained in the storage tank found in violation, and, provided that the retailer or WPC has no reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certifications are inaccurate.
