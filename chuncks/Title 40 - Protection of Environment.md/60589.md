(c)A tolerance with regional registration is established for residues of the insecticide disulfoton,-diethyl-(2-(ethylthio)ethyl) phosphorodithioate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodity in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of disulfoton,-diethyl-(2-(ethylthio)ethyl) phosphorodithioate, and its metabolites demeton-,-diethyl-(2-(ethylthio)ethyl) phosphorothioate; disulfoton sulfoxide,-diethyl-(2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethyl) phosphorodithioate; disulfoton oxygen analog sulfoxide,-diethyl-(2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethyl) phosphorothioate, disulfoton sulfone,-diethyl-(2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethyl) phosphorodithioate; and disulfoton oxygen analog sulfone,-diethyl-(2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethyl) phosphorothioate; calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of disulfoton, in or on the commodity.
