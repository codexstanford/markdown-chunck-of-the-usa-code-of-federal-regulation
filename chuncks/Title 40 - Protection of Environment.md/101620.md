####### Torque broadcasting.

(b)Electronically controlled engines must broadcast their speed and output shaft torque (in newton-meters). Engines may alternatively broadcast a surrogate value for determining torque. Engines must broadcast engine parameters such that they can be read with a remote device, or broadcast them directly to their controller area networks. This information is necessary for testing engines in the field (see ยง 1048.515). This requirement applies beginning in the 2007 model year. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit this requirement.
