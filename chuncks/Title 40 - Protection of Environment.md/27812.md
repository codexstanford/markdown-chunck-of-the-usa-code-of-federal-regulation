(d)-(1)For uncontrolled coatings that are not averaged, each 24 hours is considered a performance test. For compliant and non-compliant coatings that are averaged together, each 30-day period is considered a performance test, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program. When using a control device other than a carbon adsorber, three 1-hour runs constitute the test period for the initial and any subsequent performance test. When using a carbon adsorber, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test.
