####### Cycle-validation criteria.

(f)Unless the standard-setting part specifies otherwise, use the following criteria to validate a duty cycle:

(1) For variable-speed engines, apply all the statistical criteria in Table 2 of this section.

(2) For constant-speed engines, apply only the statistical criteria for torque in Table 2 of this section.

(3) For discrete-mode steady-state testing, apply cycle-validation criteria by treating the sampling periods from the series of test modes as a continuous sampling period, analogous to ramped-modal testing and apply statistical criteria as described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section. Note that if the gaseous and particulate test intervals are different periods of time, separate validations are required for the gaseous and particulate test intervals. Table 2 follows:
