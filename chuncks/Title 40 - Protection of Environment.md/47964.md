###### ยง 86.1825-08 Durability demonstration procedures for refueling emissions.
####### Whole vehicle refueling durability demonstration.

(c)The following procedures must be used when conducting a whole vehicle durability demonstration:

(1) Mileage accumulation must be conducted using the SRC or a road cycle approved under the provisions of ยง 86.1823(e)(1).

(2) Mileage accumulation must be conducted for either:

(i) The applicable full useful life mileage period specified in ยง 86.1805, or

(ii) At least 75 percent of the full useful life mileage. In which case, the manufacturer must calculate a df calculated according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the DF must be based upon a line projected to the full-useful life mileage using the upper 80 percent statistical confidence limit calculated from the emission data.

(3) The manufacturer must conduct at least one refueling emission test at each of the five different mileage points selected using good engineering judgement. The required testing must include testing at 5,000 miles and at the highest mileage point run during mileage accumulation (e.g. the full useful life mileage). Additional testing may be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement.
