###### How to get Reimbursed
####### ยง 310.19 Under what conditions would EPA deny my request?

We may deny your reimbursement request in full or in part if:

(a) Your records, documents, or other evidence are not maintained according to generally accepted accounting principles and practices consistently applied;

(b) The costs you claim are NOT reasonable or allowable, that is, they are higher than what a careful person would spend for similar products or services in your area; or

(c) You do not supply additional information within one year from when we request it; and

(d) Reimbursement would be inconsistent with CERCLA section 123, or the regulations in this part.
