######## Monitoring of scrap contamination level by calculation method for group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices.

(q)The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace dedicated to processing a distinct type of furnace feed/charge composed of scrap with a uniform composition (such as rejected product from a manufacturing process for which the coating-to-scrap ratio can be documented) may include a program in the site-specific monitoring plan for determining, monitoring, and certifying the scrap contaminant level using a calculation method rather than a scrap inspection program. A scrap contaminant monitoring program using a calculation method must include:

(1) Procedures for the characterization and documentation of the contaminant level of the scrap prior to the performance test.

(2) Limitations on the furnace feed/charge to scrap of the same composition as that used in the performance test. If the performance test was conducted with a mixture of scrap and clean charge, limitations on the proportion of scrap in the furnace feed/charge to no greater than the proportion used during the performance test.

(3) Operating, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements to ensure that no scrap with a contaminant level higher than that used in the performance test is charged to the furnace.
