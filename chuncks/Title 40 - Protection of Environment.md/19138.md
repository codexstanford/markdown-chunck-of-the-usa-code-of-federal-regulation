####### Residential masonry heater,e.g.,

means a factory-built or site-built wood-burning device in which the heat from intermittent fires burned rapidly in the firebox is stored in the refractory mass for slow release to building spaces. Masonry heaters are site-built (using local materials or a combination of local materials and manufactured components) or site-assembled (using factory-built components), solid fuel-burning heating appliances constructed mainly of refractory materials (masonry materials or soapstone. They typically have an interior construction consisting of a firebox and heat exchange channels built from refractory components, through which flue gases are routed. ASTM E-1602 "Standard Guide for Construction of Solid Fuel Burning Masonry Heaters" provides design and construction information for the range of masonry heaters most commonly built in the United States. The site-assembled models are generally listed to UL-1482.
