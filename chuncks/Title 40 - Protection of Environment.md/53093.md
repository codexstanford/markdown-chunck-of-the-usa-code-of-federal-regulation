###### ยง 98.453 Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) For each electrical equipment manufacturer or refurbisher, estimate the annual SFand PFC emissions using the mass-balance approach in Equation SS-1 of this section:

(b) Use the mass-balance method in paragraph (a) of this section to estimate emissions of PFCs associated with the manufacture or refurbishment of power transformers, substituting the relevant PFC(s) for SFin Equation SS-1 of this section.

(c) Estimate the disbursements of SFor PFCs sent to customers in new equipment or cylinders or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers using Equation SS-2 of this section:

(d) Estimate the mass of SFor PFCs disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p by monitoring the mass flow of the SFor PFCs into the new equipment or cylinders using a flowmeter, or by weighing containers before and after gas from containers is used to fill equipment or cylinders, or by using the nameplate capacity of the equipment.

(e) If the mass of SFor the PFC disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is estimated by weighing containers before and after gas from containers is used to fill equipment or cylinders, estimate this quantity using Equation SS-3 of this section:

(f) If the mass of SFor the PFC disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is determined using a flowmeter, estimate this quantity using Equation SS-4 of this section:

(g) Estimate the mass of SFor the PFC emitted during the period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders (e.g., emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the container to the equipment or cylinder that is being filled) using Equation SS-5 of this section:

(h) If the mass of SFor the PFC disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is determined by using the nameplate capacity, or by using the nameplate capacity of the equipment and calculating the partial shipping charge, use the methods in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section.

(1) Determine the equipment's actual nameplate capacity, by measuring the nameplate capacities of a representative sample of each make and model and calculating the mean value for each make and model as specified at ยง 98.454(f).

(2) If equipment is shipped with a partial charge, calculate the partial shipping charge by multiplying the nameplate capacity of the equipment by the ratio of the densities of the partial charge to the full charge.

(i) Estimate the annual SFand PFC emissions from the equipment that is installed at an off-site electric power transmission or distribution location before the title to the equipment is transferred by using Equation SS-6 of this section:
