####### Establishment of scrubber operating parameters.

(b)During the performance test for each emission control device, the owner or operator using a wet scrubber to achieve compliance shall establish site-specific operating parameter values for the minimum scrubber makeup water flow rate and, for scrubbers that operate with recirculation, the minimum recirculation water flow rate. During the emission test, each operating parameter must be monitored continuously and recorded with sufficient frequency to establish a representative average value for that parameter, but no less frequently than once every 15 minutes. The owner or operator shall determine the operating parameter monitoring values as the averages of the values recorded during any of the runs for which results are used to establish the emission concentration or collection efficiency per paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish alternative compliant operating parameter values. Also, an owner or operator may reestablish compliant operating parameter values as part of any performance test that is conducted subsequent to the initial test or tests.
