###### Sampling Time.

3.14In batch sampling-the time required to fill the cell with flue gas. In continuous sampling-the time required to collect the infrared spectrum of the sample gas.

3.15 PPM-Meters. Sample concentration expressed as the concentration-path length product, ppm (molar) concentration multiplied by the path length of the FTIR gas cell. Expressing concentration in these units provides a way to directly compare measurements made using systems with different optical configurations. Another useful expression is (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the absolute temperature of the sample in the gas cell.
