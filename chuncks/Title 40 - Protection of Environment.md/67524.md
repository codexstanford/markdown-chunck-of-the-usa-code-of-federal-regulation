() Industrial furnaces that must comply with the alternative metals implementation approach under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section must specify limits on the concentration of each metal in the collected particulate matter in lieu of feed rate limits for total feedstreams;

(B) Total hazardous waste feed (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e)); and

(C) Total pumpable hazardous waste feed (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e));

(iii) Total feed rate of chlorine and chloride in total feed streams, except that facilities that comply with Tier I or Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits may set their operating limits at the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits determined under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e);

(iv) Total feed rate of ash in total feed streams, except that the ash feed rate for cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns is not limited;

(v) Carbon monoxide concentration, and where required, hydrocarbon concentration in stack gas. When complying with the CO controls of § 266.104(b), the CO limit is 100 ppmv, and when complying with the HC controls of § 266.104(c), the HC limit is 20 ppmv. When complying with the CO controls of § 266.104(c), the CO limit is established based on the compliance test;

(vi) Maximum production rate of the device in appropriate units when producing normal product, unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limits for chlorine under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e) and for all metals under § 266.106(b) or (e), and the uncontrolled particulate emissions do not exceed the standard under § 266.105;

(vii) Maximum combustion chamber temperature where the temperature measurement is as close to the combustion zone as possible and is upstream of any quench water injection (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e));

(viii) Maximum flue gas temperature entering a particulate matter control device (unless complying with Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b) or (e));

(ix) For systems using wet scrubbers, including wet ionizing scrubbers (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e)):

(A) Minimum liquid to flue gas ratio;

(B) Minimum scrubber blowdown from the system or maximum suspended solids content of scrubber water; and

(C) Minimum pH level of the scrubber water;

(x) For systems using venturi scrubbers, the minimum differential gas pressure across the venturi (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e));

(xi) For systems using dry scrubbers (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e)):

(A) Minimum caustic feed rate; and

(B) Maximum flue gas flow rate;

(xii) For systems using wet ionizing scrubbers or electrostatic precipitators (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e)):

(A) Minimum electrical power in kilovolt amperes (kVA) to the precipitator plates; and

(B) Maximum flue gas flow rate;

(xiii) For systems using fabric filters (baghouses), the minimum pressure drop (unless complying with the Tier I or Adjusted Tier I metal feed rate screening limits under § 266.106(b) or (e) and the total chlorine and chloride feed rate screening limits under § 266.107(b)(1) or (e)).
