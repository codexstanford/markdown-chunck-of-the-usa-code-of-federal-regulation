####### De minimis rate of impingement.,et seq.

(11)In limited circumstances, rates of impingement may be so low at a facility that additional impingement controls may not be justified. The Director, based on review of site-specific data submitted under 40 CFR 122.21(r), may conclude that the documented rate of impingement at the cooling water intake is so low that no additional controls are warranted. For threatened or endangered species, all unauthorized take is prohibited by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531). Notice of a determination that no additional impingement controls are warranted must be included in the draft or proposed permit and the Director's response to all comments on this determination must be included in the record for the final permit.
