() Each unique methanol and co-solvent combination (whether one, two, or more additional oxygenate compounds) used in a non-baseline fuel shall also define a separate group. An oxygenate compound used as a co-solvent for methanol in a non-baseline gasoline formulation must be identified as such in its registration. If the oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, then the compound shall be regarded by EPA as defining a separate non-baseline gasoline group. Examples of methanol/co-solvent combinations occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include methanol/isopropyl alcohol, methanol/butanol, and methanol with alcohols up to C8/octanol (Octamix).
