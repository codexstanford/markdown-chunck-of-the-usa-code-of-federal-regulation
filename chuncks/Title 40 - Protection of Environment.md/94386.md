(a)(1) A generator of PCB waste, who does not receive a copy of the manifest with the handwritten signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility within 35 days of the date the waste was accepted by the initial transporter, shall immediately contact the transporter and/or the owner or operator of the designated facility to determine the status of the PCB waste.

(2) A generator of PCB waste subject to the manifesting requirements shall submit an Exception Report to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the generator is located if the generator has not received a copy of the manifest with the hand written signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility within 45 days of the date the waste was accepted by the initial transporter. The exception report shall be submitted to EPA no later than 45 days from the date on which the generator should have received the manifest. The Exception Report shall include the following:

(i) A legible copy of the manifest for which the generator does not have confirmation of delivery;

(ii) A cover letter signed by the generator or his authorized representative explaining the efforts taken to locate the PCB waste and the results of those efforts.

(b) For rejected shipments of PCB waste that are forwarded to an alternate facility by a designated facility using a new manifest (following the procedures of ยง 761.215(e)(1) through (6)), the generator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable, for the shipment forwarding the material from the designated facility to the alternate facility instead of for the shipment from the generator to the designated facility. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section for a shipment forwarding such waste to an alternate facility by a designated facility:

(1) The copy of the manifest received by the generator must have the handwritten signature of the owner or operator of the alternate facility in place of the signature of the owner or operator of the designated facility, and

(2) The 35- and 45-day timeframes begin the date the waste was accepted by the initial transporter forwarding the PCB waste shipment from the designated facility to the alternate facility.
