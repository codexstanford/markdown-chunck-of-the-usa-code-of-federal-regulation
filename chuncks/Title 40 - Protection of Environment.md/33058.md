####### Mercury emissions

(2). (i) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 13 micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm) into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.

(ii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 130 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing ferromanganese.

(iii) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 4 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.

(iv) You must not discharge exhaust gases from each electric arc furnace operation containing mercury emissions in excess of 12 µg/dscm into the atmosphere from any existing electric arc furnace when producing silicomanganese.
