###### Calibration drift,24 hour

6.3.3(). From the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test calculate the differences between: (1) The calibration reading after zero and calibration adjustment, and (2) the calibration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the calibration drift.
