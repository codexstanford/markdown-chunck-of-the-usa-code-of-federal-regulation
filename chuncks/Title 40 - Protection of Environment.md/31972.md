####### Annual factors.

(1)The annual HAP and VOC factors shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) The consumption of both total HAP and total VOC shall be divided by the production rate, per process, for 12-month periods at the frequency specified in either paragraph (f)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable.

(ii) For continuous processes, the annual factors shall be calculated every 30 days for the 12-month period preceding the 30th day (annual rolling average calculated every 30 days). A process with both batch and continuous operations is considered a continuous process for the purposes of this section.

(iii) For batch processes, the annual factors shall be calculated every 10 batches for the 12-month period preceding the 10th batch (annual rolling average calculated every 10 batches). Additional annual factors shall be calculated every 12 months during the period before the 10th batch if more than 12 months elapse before the 10th batch is produced.
