####### § 63.2450 What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
######## Outlet concentration correction for combustion devices.

(i)Except as specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, when § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3-percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, the requirements in either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(1) You must correct the concentration in the gas stream at the outlet of the combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental gases, as defined in § 63.2550, to the vent stream, or;

(2) You must correct the measured concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 in § 63.2460(c)(6); you may use process knowledge and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.

(3) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section no longer apply. Instead, when § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3-percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, you must follow the procedures in § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) to perform the concentration correction, except you may also use Method 3A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, to determine the oxygen concentration.
