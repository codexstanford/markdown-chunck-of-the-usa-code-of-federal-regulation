(2) The transient test intervals and duty cycles for powertrain testing involves a schedule of vehicle speeds and road grade. Determine road grade at each point based on the peak rated power of the powertrain system,determined in ยง 1036.520 and road grade coefficients using the following equation:= a &#xB7;+&#xB7;+

(3) The operating schedules in this appendix in some cases eliminate repetitive information by omitting 1 Hz records where there is no change in values. Perform testing by continuing to operate at the last specified values until the operating schedule shows a change in values. The official operating schedule for testing, cycle validation, and other purposes includes both the specified and omitted values.

(b) The following transient test interval applies for spark-ignition engines and powertrains when testing over the duty cycle specified in ยง 1036.512:

(c) The following transient test interval applies for compression-ignition engines and powertrains when testing over the duty cycle specified in ยง 1036.512:

(d) The following transient duty cycle applies for compression-ignition engines and powertrains when testing under ยง 1036.514:
