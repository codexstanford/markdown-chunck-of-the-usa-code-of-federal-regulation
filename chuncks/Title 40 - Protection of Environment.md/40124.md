###### Sample Pump.

6.1A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF), with by-pass valve, capable of producing a sample flow rate of at least 10 L/min through 100 ft of sample line. If the pump is positioned upstream of the distribution manifold and FTIR system, use a heated pump that is constructed from materials non-reactive to the analytes. If the pump is located downstream of the FTIR system, the gas cell sample pressure will be lower than ambient pressure and it must be recorded at regular intervals.
