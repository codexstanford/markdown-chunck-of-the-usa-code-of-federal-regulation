######## Remediation material

means a material that contains one or more of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart, and this material is one of the following:

(1) A material found in naturally occurring media such as soil, groundwater, surface water, sediments, or a mixture of such materials with liquids, sludges, or solids which is inseparable by simple mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of media. This material does not include debris as defined in 40 CFR 268.2.

(2) A material found in intact or substantially intact containers, tanks, storage piles, or other storage units that requires clean up because this material poses a reasonable potential threat to contaminating media. Examples of these materials include, but are not limited to, solvents, oils, paints, and other volatile or semi-volatile organic liquids found in buried drums, cans, or other containers; gasoline, fuel oil, or other fuels in leaking underground storage tanks; and solid materials containing volatile or semi-volatile organics in unused or abandoned piles. Remediation material is not a waste or residue generated by routine equipment maintenance activities performed at a facility such as, but not limited to, tank bottoms and sludges removed during tank cleanouts; sludges and sediments removed from active wastewater treatment tanks, surface impoundments, or lagoons; spent catalyst removed from process equipment; residues removed from air pollution control equipment; and debris removed during heat exchanger and pipeline cleanouts.
