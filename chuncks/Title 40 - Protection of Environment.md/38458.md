5.1.2.1 The test frequency for RRAs of the PM CEMS shall be annual,once every 4 calendar quarters. The RRA must either be performed within the fourth calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which the previous RRA was completed or in a grace period (see section 5.1.3, below). When a required annual RRA is done within a grace period, the deadline for the next RRA is 4 calendar quarters after the quarter in which the RRA was originally due, rather than the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is completed.
