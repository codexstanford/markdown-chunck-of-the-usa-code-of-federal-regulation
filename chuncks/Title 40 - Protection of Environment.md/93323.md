####### Microorganism identity and production method.

(d)If confidentiality claims are asserted for the identity of the microorganism or information on how the microorganism is produced, the following questions must be answered:

(1) Has the microorganism or method of production been patented in the U.S. or elsewhere? If so, why is confidentiality necessary?

(2) Does the microorganism leave the site of production or testing in a form which is accessible to the public or to competitors? What is the cost to a competitor, in time and money, to develop appropriate use conditions? What factors facilitate or impede product analysis?

(3) For each additional type of information claimed as confidential, explain what harm would result from disclosure of each type of information if the identity of the microorganism were to remain confidential.
