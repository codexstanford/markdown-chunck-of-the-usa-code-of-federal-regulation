####### Measuring NO,emissions.

(f)Measure NOemissions for each sampling period in g/s. You may perform these measurements using a NOemission-measurement system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J. If a system malfunction prevents you from measuring NOemissions during a test under this section but the test otherwise gives valid results, you may consider this a valid test and omit the NOemission measurements; however, we may require you to repeat the test if we determine that you inappropriately voided the test with respect to NOemission measurement.
