###### Evaluation of overland/flood migration component.

4.1.1.3Evaluate the drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat for each watershed for this component based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 4-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category for each type of threat.

Determine the overland/flood migration component score (S) for a watershed in terms of the factor category values as follows:

If the site is in only one watershed, assign the overland/flood migration score for that watershed as the overland/flood migration component score for the site.

If the site is in more than one watershed:

- Calculate a separate overland/flood migration component score for each watershed, using likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets applicable to each watershed.

- Select the highest overland/flood migration component score from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the overland/flood migration component score for the site.
