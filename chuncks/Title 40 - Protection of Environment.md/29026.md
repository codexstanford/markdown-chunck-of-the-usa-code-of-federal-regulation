####### Instrumentation system

means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and smaller, and connectors nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and connectors greater than nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.
