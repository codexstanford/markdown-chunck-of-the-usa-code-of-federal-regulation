####### Foreclosure.

(1)(i) Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title or deed to real or personal property acquired through or incident to foreclosure. For purposes of this subpart, the term "foreclosure" means that legal, marketable or equitable title or deed has been issued, approved, and recorded, and that the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to gain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located. The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided that the holder does not participate in management (as defined in ยง 280.210(a)) prior to or after foreclosure.
