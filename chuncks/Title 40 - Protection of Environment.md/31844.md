####### Testing conditions for continuous processes.

(10)Testing of process vents on equipment operating as part of a continuous process shall consist of three one-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. Organic HAP concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of each one-hour test run, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the three test runs.
