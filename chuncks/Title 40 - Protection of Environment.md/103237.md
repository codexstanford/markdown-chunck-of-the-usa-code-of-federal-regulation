####### Crankcase flow rate.,[object Object],[object Object]

(1)If engines are not subject to crankcase controls under the standard-setting part, you may calculate raw exhaust flow based onorusing one of the following:

(i) You may measure flow rate through the crankcase vent and subtract it from the calculated exhaust flow.

(ii) You may estimate flow rate through the crankcase vent by engineering analysis as long as the uncertainty in your calculation does not adversely affect your ability to show that your engines comply with applicable emission standards.

(iii) You may assume your crankcase vent flow rate is zero.
