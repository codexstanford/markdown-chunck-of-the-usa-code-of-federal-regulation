######## Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled dyeing/finishing operation not using liquid-liquid material balance.

(4)For each controlled dyeing/finishing operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions using Equation 5 of this section. The equation applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the dyeing and finishing materials applied in the dyeing/finishing operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period. For any period of time a deviation specified in ยง 63.4342(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled dyeing/finishing operation, then you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. Equation 5 of this section treats the dyeing and finishing materials applied during such a deviation as if they were applied on an uncontrolled dyeing/finishing operation for the time period of the deviation.

(i) Calculate the total mass of organic HAP in the dyeing and finishing materials applied in the controlled dyeing/finishing operation(s) during the compliance period, kg, using Equation 5A of this section:

(ii) Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the dyeing and finishing materials applied in the controlled dyeing/finishing operation during deviations specified in ยง 63.4342(c) and (d), using Equation 5B of this section.
