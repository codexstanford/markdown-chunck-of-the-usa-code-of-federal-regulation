###### Vanadium Sublimation In SCR Catalysts
####### ยง 1065.1113 General provisions related to vanadium sublimation temperatures in SCR catalysts.

Sections 1065.1113 through 1065.1121 specify procedures for determining vanadium emissions from a catalyst based on catalyst temperature. Vanadium can be emitted from the surface of SCR catalysts at temperatures above 550 &#xB0;C, dependent on the catalyst formulation. These procedures are appropriate for measuring the vanadium sublimation product from a reactor by sampling onto an equivalent mass of alumina and performing analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Follow standard analytic chemistry methods for any aspects of the analysis that are not specified.
