6.1The weight of material collected on the filter represents the (integrated) sum of the product of the instantaneous flow rate times the instantaneous particle concentration. Therefore, dividing this weight by the average flow rate over the sampling period yields the true particulate matter concentration only when the flow rate is constant over the period. The error resulting from a nonconstant flow rate depends on the magnitude of the instantaneous changes in the flow rate and in the particulate matter concentration. Normally, such errors are not large, but they can be greatly reduced by equipping the sampler with an automatic flow controlling mechanism that maintains constant flow during the sampling period. Use of a contant flow controller is recommended.*
