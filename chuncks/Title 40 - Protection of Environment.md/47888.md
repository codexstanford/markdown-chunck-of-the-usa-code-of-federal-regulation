####### Use of deterioration program to determine compliance with the standard.

(3)The manufacturer shall propose procedures for the determination of compliance with the standards for advance approval by the Administrator. The calculation of deterioration factors and/or the determination of vehicle compliance shall be according to the procedures approved in advance by the Administrator. The Administrator will allow two methods for using the results of the deterioration program to determine compliance with the standards. Either a deterioration factor (DF) is calculated and applied to the emission data vehicle (EDV) emission results or aged components are installed on the EDV prior to emission testing. Other methods may be approved by the Administrator if they result in an effective prediction of intermediate and full useful life emission levels on candidate in-use vehicles.
