5.1 Because the size of the particles making up ambient particulate matter varies over a wide range and the concentration of particles varies with particle size, it is difficult to define the absolute accuracy of PMsamplers. Part 53 of this chapter provides a specification for the sampling effectiveness of PMsamplers. This specification requires that the expected mass concentration calculated for a candidate PMsampler, when sampling a specified particle size distribution, be within +/-10 percent of that calculated for an ideal sampler whose sampling effectiveness is explicitly specified. Also, the particle size for 50 percent sampling effectiveness is required to be 10 +/-0.5 micrometers. Other specifications related to accuracy apply to flow measurement and calibration, filter media, analytical (weighing) procedures, and artifact. The flow rate accuracy of PMsamplers used in certain monitoring networks is required by part 58 of this chapter to be assessed periodically via flow rate audits.
