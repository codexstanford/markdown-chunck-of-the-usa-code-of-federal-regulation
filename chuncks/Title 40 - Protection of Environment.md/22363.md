7.8.9.4 Carbon/Celite&#xAE; 545 (or equivalent solid support). Use of a carbon-based column cleanup material (one of the many including for example Carbopack&#xAE; B or C) to further remove non-planar impurities from the samples prior to analysis may be necessary. You must evaluate alternative carbon-based sorbents for this purpose prior to their use. An 18% weight/weight mixture of Carbopack&#xAE; C and Celite&#xAE; 545 has been used for this purpose and should be activated at 130 &#xB0;C (266 &#xB0;F) for a minimum of 6 hours. Allow to cool and store this mixture in a desiccator.

7.8.10 Nitrogen. 99.999% (ultra-high) purity.

7.9 Sample Analysis.

7.9.1 Helium. 99.999% (ultra-high) purity.
