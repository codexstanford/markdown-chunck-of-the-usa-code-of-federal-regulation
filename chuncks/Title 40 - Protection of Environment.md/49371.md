####### § 97.54 Compliance.
######## Deduction of banked allowances.

(f)Each year starting in 2006, after the Administrator has completed the designation of banked NOallowances under § 97.55(b) and before May 1 of the year, the Administrator will determine the extent to which banked NOallowances otherwise available under paragraph (a) of this section are available for compliance in the control period for the current year, as follows. For each State NOBudget Trading Program that is established, and approved and administered by the Administrator pursuant to § 51.121 of this chapter, the terms "compliance account" or "compliance accounts", "overdraft account" or "overdraft accounts", "general account" or "general accounts", "States", and "trading program budgets under § 97.40" in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section shall be read to include respectively: A compliance account or compliance accounts established under such State NOBudget Trading Program; an overdraft account or overdraft accounts established under such State NOBudget Trading Program; a general account or general accounts established under such State NOBudget Trading Program; the State or portion of a State covered by such State NOBudget Trading Program; and the trading program budget of the State or portion of a State covered by such State NOBudget Trading Program.

(1) The Administrator will determine the total number of banked NOallowances held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts.

(2) If the total number of banked NOallowances determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts is less than or equal to 10 percent of the sum of the trading program budgets under § 97.40 for all States for the control period, any banked NOallowance may be deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.

(3) If the total number of banked NOallowances determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts exceeds 10 percent of the sum of the trading program budgets under § 97.40 for all States for the control period, any banked allowance may be deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, except as follows:

(i) The Administrator will determine the following ratio: 0.10 multiplied by the sum of the trading program budgets under § 97.40 for all States for the control period and divided by the total number of banked NOallowances determined, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to be held in compliance accounts, overdraft accounts, or general accounts.

(ii) The Administrator will multiply the number of banked NOallowances in each compliance account or overdraft account by the ratio determined under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section. The resulting product is the number of banked NOallowances in the account that may be deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Any banked NOallowances in excess of the resulting product may be deducted for compliance in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, except that, if such NOallowances are used to make a deduction under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, two (rather than one) such NOallowances shall authorize up to one ton of NOemissions during the control period and must be deducted for each deduction of one NOallowance required under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section.
