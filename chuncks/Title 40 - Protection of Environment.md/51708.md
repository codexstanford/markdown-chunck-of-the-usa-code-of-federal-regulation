####### Poultry manure without litter

means a manure management system component that may manage manure in a liquid form, similar to open pits in enclosed animal confinement facilities. These systems may alternatively be designed and operated to dry manure as it accumulates. The latter is known as a high-rise manure management system and is a form of passive windrow manure composting when designed and operated properly.
