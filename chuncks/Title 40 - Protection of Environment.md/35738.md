######## Organic HAP emissions from intermittently-controllable or never-controlled coil coating stations.

(h)If you have been expressly referenced to this paragraph by paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2)(ii)(B), (g)(3)(iii)(B), or (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section for calculation procedures to determine organic HAP emissions, you must for your intermittently-controllable or never-controlled work stations meet the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (6) of this section:

(1) Determine the sum of the mass of all solids-containing coating materials which are applied on intermittently-controllable work stations in bypass mode, and the mass of all solids-containing coating materials which are applied on never-controlled coil coating stations during each month of the 12-month compliance period, M.

(2) Determine the sum of the mass of all solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other nonsolids-containing coating materials which are applied on intermittently-controllable work stations in bypass mode, and the mass of all solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents and other nonsolids-containing coating materials which are applied on never-controlled work stations during each month of the 12-month compliance period, M.

(3) Determine the sum of the mass of all solids-containing coating materials which are applied on intermittently-controllable work stations in controlled mode, and the mass of all solids-containing coating materials which are applied on always-controlled work stations during each month of the 12-month compliance period, M.

(4) Determine the sum of the mass of all solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other nonsolids-containing coating materials which are applied on intermittently-controllable work stations in controlled mode, and the mass of all solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other nonsolids-containing coating materials which are applied on always-controlled work stations during each month of the 12-month compliance period, M.
