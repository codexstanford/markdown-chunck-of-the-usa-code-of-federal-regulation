####### Best available monitoring methods for well-related measurement data.

(2)You may use best available monitoring methods for well-related measurement data identified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section that cannot reasonably be measured according to the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of this subpart.

(i) If Calculation Method 1 for liquids unloading in ยง 98.233(f)(1) was used in calendar year 2014 and will be used again in calendar year 2015, the vented natural gas flow rate for any well in a unique tubing diameter group and pressure group combination that has not been previously measured.

(ii) If using Equation W-10A of this subpart to determine natural gas emissions from completions and workovers for representative wells, the initial and average flowback rates (when using Calculation Method 1 in ยง 98.233(g)(1)(i)) or pressures upstream and downstream of the choke (when using Calculation Method 2 in ยง 98.233(g)(1)(ii)) for any well in a well type combination that has not been previously measured.
