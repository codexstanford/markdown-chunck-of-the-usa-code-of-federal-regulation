(ii)As soon as measured engine speed is within the range specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, but not more than 3 seconds after the start of the test, rapidly set and hold operator demand at maximum. Operate the dynamometer using a preselected load to accelerate engine speed to 85 percent of maximum test speed, &#x192;in (5 +/-1.5) seconds. The engine speed throughout the acceleration must be within +/-100 r/min of a target represented by a linear transition between the low and high engine speed targets.
