###### Proximity to Public Drinking Water Intakes at Facilities with a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons

2.4A facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 million gallons must submit its response plan if it is located at a distance such that a discharge from the facility would shut down a public drinking water intake, which is analogous to a public water system as described at 40 CFR 143.2(c). The distance at which an oil discharge from an SPCC-regulated facility would shut down a public drinking water intake shall be calculated using the appropriate formula presented in Attachment C-III to this appendix or a comparable formula.
