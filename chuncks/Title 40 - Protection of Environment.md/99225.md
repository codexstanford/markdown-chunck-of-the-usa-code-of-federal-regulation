####### System losses

means the loss of particles during transport through a sampling or measurement system component or due to instrument performance. Sampling and measurement system loss is due to various deposition mechanisms, some of which are particle-size dependent. Determining an engine's actual emission rate depends on correcting for system losses in the nvPM measurement.
