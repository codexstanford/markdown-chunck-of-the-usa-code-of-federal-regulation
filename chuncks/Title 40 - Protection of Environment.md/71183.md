###### What Can Be Reimbursed?
####### ยง 310.9 If more than one local agency or government is involved, can each receive up to $25,000?

No. The maximum amount EPA can reimburse is $25,000 for a single response, which includes all activities by ALL local responders. If the costs incurred by multiple local governments or agencies exceed $25,000, you must decide among yourselves how the total reimbursement will be divided.
