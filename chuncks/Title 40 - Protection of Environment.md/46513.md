(8) Any manufacturer, producing an engine family participating in trading using reserved credits, shall maintain the following records on a quarterly basis for each engine family in the trading subclass:

(i) The engine family,

(ii) The averaging set,

(iii) The actual quarterly and cumulative U.S. production volumes,

(d)(1) Any manufacturer who has applied for certification of a new motor vehicle (or new motor vehicle engine) subject to certification test under this subpart shall admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer or any EPA authorized representative during operating hours on presentation of credentials to any of the following:

(i) Any facility where any such tests or any procedures or activities connected with such test are or were performed.

(ii) Any facility where any new motor vehicle (or new motor vehicle engine) which is being, was, or is to be tested is present.

(iii) Any facility where any construction process or assembly process used in the modification or build up of such a vehicle (or engine) into a certification vehicle (or certification engine) is taking place or has taken place.

(iv) Any facility where any record or other document relating to any of the above is located.

(v) Any facility where any record or other document relating to the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section is located.

(2) [Reserved]

(3) In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether or not production motor vehicles (or production motor vehicle engines) conform to the conditions upon which a certificate of conformity has been issued, or conform in all material respects to the design specifications which applied to those vehicles (or engines) described in the application for certification for which a certificate of conformity has been issued to standards prescribed under section 202 of the Act, any manufacturer shall admit any EPA Enforcement Officer or any EPA authorized representative on presentation of credentials to both:

(i) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating to the translation of the design and construction of engines and emission related components described in the application for certification or used for certification testing into production vehicles (or production engines) is located or carried on;

(ii) Any facility where any motor vehicles (or motor vehicle engines) to be introduced into commerce are manufactured or assembled; and

(iii) Any facility where records specified in paragraph (c) of this section are located.

(4) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, any EPA Enforcement Officer or any EPA authorized representative shall be allowed:

(i) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or assembly and other procedures;

(ii) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or designs;

(iii) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new motor vehicles (or new motor vehicle engines) and any component used in the assembly thereof that are reasonably related to the purpose of his entry; and

(iv) To inspect and make copies of any records and documents specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(5) Any EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility being inspected with such reasonable assistance as he may request to help him discharge any function listed in this paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.

(6) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that a vehicle or engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.

(7) For purposes of this paragraph:
