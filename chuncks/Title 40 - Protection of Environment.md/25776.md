####### Knowledge of the wastewater.

(3)Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the annual average concentration for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average concentration is not required for Group 1 streams. Examples of acceptable documentation include material balances, records of chemical purchases, process stoichiometry, or previous test results. If test data are used, the owner or operator shall provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination.
