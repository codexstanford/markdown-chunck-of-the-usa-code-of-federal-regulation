###### 1.1 Background.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (CWA), to require the revision of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). In revising the NCP, the need to separate the response requirements for oil discharges and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants became evident.
