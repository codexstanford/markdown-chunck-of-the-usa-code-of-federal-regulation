###### ยง 157.24 Exemptions.
####### Products classified for restricted use.

(1)(i) A product restricted to use by or under the supervision of a certified applicator is not required to be distributed and sold in child-resistant packaging.

(ii) Notwithstanding the exemption in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Agency may require the use of child-resistant packaging for a product classified for restricted use by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator if the Agency determines that the product poses a risk of serious accidental injury or illness which child-resistant packaging could reduce. If the Agency makes such a determination, it will notify the registrant in writing and provide a short statement of the basis of its determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to require the product to be distributed only in child-resistant packaging and will notify the registrant of its decision.
