####### i.e.,

(A) Conduct a performance test following the methods provided in paragraphs (i)(1), (2), (3) and (5) of this section at a representative condition for each operating range for which different Ooperating limits will be established. Different operating conditions may be defined as different firing rates (e.g., above 50 percent of rated heat capacity and at or below 50 percent of rated heat capacity) and/or, for co-fired process heaters, different fuel mixtures (e.g., primarily gas fired, primarily oil fired, and equally co-fired,approximately 50 percent of the input heating value is from fuel gas and approximately 50 percent of the input heating value is from fuel oil). Performance tests for different operating ranges may be conducted at different times.

(B) Each test will consist of three test runs. Calculate the NOconcentration for the performance test as the average of the NOconcentrations from each of the three test runs. If the NOconcentration for the performance test is less than or equal to the numerical value of the applicable NOemissions limit (regardless of averaging time), then the test is considered to be a valid test.
