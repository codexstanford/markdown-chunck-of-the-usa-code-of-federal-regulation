(a)Systems receive 0.5-logtreatment credit for a presedimentation basin during any month the process meets the criteria in this paragraph.

(1) The presedimentation basin must be in continuous operation and must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.

(2) The system must continuously add a coagulant to the presedimentation basin.

(3) The presedimentation basin must achieve the performance criteria in paragraph (3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) Demonstrates at least 0.5-log mean reduction of influent turbidity. This reduction must be determined using daily turbidity measurements in the presedimentation process influent and effluent and must be calculated as follows: log(monthly mean of daily influent turbidity)-log(monthly mean of daily effluent turbidity).

(ii) Complies with State-approved performance criteria that demonstrate at least 0.5-log mean removal of micron-sized particulate material through the presedimentation process.
