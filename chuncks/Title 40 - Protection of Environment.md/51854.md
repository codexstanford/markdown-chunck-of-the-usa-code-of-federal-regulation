####### Calculation of CO,from sorbent.

(d)(1) When a unit is a fluidized bed boiler, is equipped with a wet flue gas desulfurization system, or uses other acid gas emission controls with sorbent injection to remove acid gases, if the chemical reaction between the acid gas and the sorbent produces COemissions, use Equation C-11 of this section to calculate the COemissions from the sorbent, except when those COemissions are monitored by CEMS. When a sorbent other than CaCOis used, determine site-specific values of R and MW.

(2) The total annual COmass emissions reported for the unit shall include the COemissions from the combustion process and the COemissions from the sorbent.
