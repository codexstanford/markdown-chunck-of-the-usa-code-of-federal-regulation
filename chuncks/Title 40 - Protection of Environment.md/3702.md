####### § 49.4169 Introduction.
######## Am I subject to §§ 49.4169 through 49.4184?

(b)Sections 49.4169 through 49.4184, as appropriate, apply to each owner or operator of an oil and natural gas source (as defined at 40 CFR 49.102) located on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation that has equipment or activities that meet the applicability thresholds specified in each section. Generally, the equipment and activities at oil and natural gas sources that are already subject to and in compliance with VOC emission control requirements under another EPA standard or other federally enforceable requirement, as specified in each appropriate subsection later, are considered to be in compliance with the requirements to control VOC emissions from that same equipment under this U&O FIP.
