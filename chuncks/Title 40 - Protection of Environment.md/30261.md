means the ratio of the predicted media concentration of a pollutant to the media concentration at which no adverse effects are expected. For chronic inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under this section as the air concentration divided by the RfC. For acute inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under this section as the air concentration divided by the aREL.
