(A)The owner or operator shall submit a request for a compliance extension to the Administrator (or a State, when the State has an approved 40 CFR part 70 permit program and the source is required to obtain a 40 CFR part 70 permit under that program, or a State, when the State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce the emission standard for that source) seeking an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the transfer rack standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. The owner or operator of the affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit, or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
