####### Unauthorized State amendments and provisions.

(4)(i) Louisiana has adopted but is not authorized to implement the HSWA rules that are listed in the Table in lieu of the EPA. The EPA will enforce the Federal HSWA standards for which Louisiana is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization from EPA.

(ii) The Federal rules listed in the table below are not delegable to States. Louisiana has adopted these provisions and left the authority to the EPA for implementation and enforcement.

(iii) (A) The following authorized provisions of the Louisiana regulations include amendments published in the Louisiana Register that are not approved by EPA. Such unauthorized amendments are not part of the State's authorized program and are, therefore, not Federally enforceable. Thus, notwithstanding the language in the Louisiana hazardous waste regulations incorporated by reference at paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will enforce the State provisions that are actually authorized by EPA. The effective dates of the State's authorized provisions are listed as follows.
