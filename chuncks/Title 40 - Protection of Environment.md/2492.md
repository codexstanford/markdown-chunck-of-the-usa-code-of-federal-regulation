Once you've determined whether Federal intergovernmental review requirements apply, you must prepare a TAG application on EPA SF-424, Application for Federal Assistance, or those forms and instructions provided by EPA that include:

(a) A "budget";

(b) A scope of work;

(c) Assurances, certifications and other pre-award paperwork as 2 CFR part 200 requires. Your EPA regional office will provide you with the required forms.
