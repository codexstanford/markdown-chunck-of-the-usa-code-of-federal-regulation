###### ยง 790.60 Contents of consent agreements.
####### Contents of standards for the development of data.

(b)The standards for the development of the data included in consent agreements will be based on the TSCA test guidelines in 40 CFR parts 796, 797, and 798, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test guidelines, the EPA pesticide assessment guidelines published by The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), or other suitable test methodologies. During the negotiation of consent agreements, EPA will initially propose suitable test guidelines as the required test standards; manufacturers and processors or other interested parties may then suggest alternative methodologies or modifications to the Agency's proposed guidelines. These alternative methodologies or modifications will be adopted only where, in the judgment of EPA, they will develop at least equally reliable and adequate data on the chemical substance or mixture subject to the agreement.
