####### Reporting.

(c)Report the following information:

(1) Temperature at which the test was conducted.

(2) Detailed description of the analytical technique(s) used in the chemical extraction, recovery, and quantitative analysis of the parent chemical.

(3) Amount of parent test chemical applied, the amount recovered, and the percent recovered.

(4) Extent of adsorption by containers and the approach used to correct the data for adsorption by containers.

(5) The individual observations, the mean values, and graphical plots of x/m as a function of Cfor each sediment or soil for (i) the equilibration time determination and (ii) the isotherm determination.

(6) The quantities K, n, and l/n.

(7) Soil information: Soil Order, series, texture, sampling location, horizon, general clay fraction mineralogy.

(8) Sediment information: sampling location, general clay fraction mineralogy.

(9) Sediment and soil physical-chemical properties: percent sand, silt, and clay (particle size analysis); percent organic matter; pH (1/1 solids/HO); and cation exchange capacity.

(10) The procedures used to determine the physical/chemical properties listed under paragraphs (c) (7) through (9) of this section.
