###### ยง 98.243 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS).

(b)Route all process vent emissions and emissions from stationary combustion units that burn any amount of process off-gas to one or more stacks and determine GHG emissions as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Determine COemissions from each stack (except flare stacks) according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology requirements in subpart C of this part.

(2) For each stack (except flare stacks) that includes emissions from combustion of petrochemical process off-gas, calculate CHand NO emissions in accordance with subpart C of this part (use Equation C-10 and the "fuel gas" emission factors in Table C-2 of subpart C of this part).

(3) For each flare, calculate CO, CH, and NO emissions using the methodology specified in ยง 98.253(b)(1) through (3).
