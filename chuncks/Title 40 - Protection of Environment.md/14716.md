####### Determination of Clean Data.

(e)EPA has determined, as of March 29, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, the Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle-York, Allentown, Johnstown, and Lancaster nonattainment areas have attained the 24-hour 2006 PMNAAQS. These determinations, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspend the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as these areas continue to meet the 24-hour 2006 PMNAAQS.
