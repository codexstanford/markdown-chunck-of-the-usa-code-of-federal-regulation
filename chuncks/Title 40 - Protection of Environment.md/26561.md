####### Adding emission points or making process changes to existing affected sources.

(2)The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.

(i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever is later.

(A) The replacement of components meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.482(b); and

(B) Such reconstruction commenced after June 12, 1995.

(ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) and (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to §§ 63.493 and 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to § 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.

(iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, back-end process operations subject to §§ 63.493 through 63.500, and heat exchange systems and equipment leak components subject to § 63.502), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.481 (i.e., July 31, 1997 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.502, and June 19, 2001 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
