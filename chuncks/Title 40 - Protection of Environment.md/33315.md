####### ยง 63.2240 What are the compliance options and operating requirements and how must I meet them?

You must meet the compliance options and operating requirements described in Tables 1A, 1B, and 2 to this subpart and in paragraph (c) of this section by using one or more of the compliance options listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The process units subject to the compliance options are listed in Tables 1A and 1B to this subpart and are defined in ยง 63.2292. You need only to meet one of the compliance options outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section for each process unit. You cannot combine compliance options in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) for a single process unit. (For example, you cannot use a production-based compliance option in paragraph (a) for one vent of a veneer dryer and an add-on control system compliance option in paragraph (b) for another vent on the same veneer dryer. You must use either the production-based compliance option or an add-on control system compliance option for the entire dryer.)
