###### § 75.58 General recordkeeping provisions for specific situations.
####### Specific parametric data record provisions for calculating substitute emissions data for units with add-on emission controls.

(b)In accordance with § 75.34, the owner or operator of an affected unit with add-on emission controls shall either record the applicable information in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for each hour of missing SOconcentration data or NOemission rate (in addition to other information), or shall record the information in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for SOor paragraph (b)(2) of this section for NOthrough an automated data acquisition and handling system, as appropriate to the type of add-on emission controls:

(1) For units with add-on SOemission controls using the optional parametric monitoring procedures in appendix C to this part, for each hour of missing SOconcentration or volumetric flow data:

(i) The information required in § 75.57(c) for SOconcentration and volumetric flow, if either one of these monitors is still operating;

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Number of operating scrubber modules;

(iv) Total feedrate of slurry to each operating scrubber module (gal/min);

(v) Pressure differential across each operating scrubber module (inches of water column);

(vi) For a unit with a wet flue gas desulfurization system, an in-line measure of absorber pH for each operating scrubber module;

(vii) For a unit with a dry flue gas desulfurization system, the inlet and outlet temperatures across each operating scrubber module;

(viii) For a unit with a wet flue gas desulfurization system, the percent solids in slurry for each scrubber module;

(ix) For a unit with a dry flue gas desulfurization system, the slurry feed rate (gal/min) to the atomizer nozzle;

(x) For a unit with SOadd-on emission controls other than wet or dry limestone, corresponding parameters approved by the Administrator;

(xi) Method of determination of SOconcentration and volumetric flow using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of § 75.57; and

(xii) Inlet and outlet SOconcentration values, recorded by an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system, and the removal efficiency of the add-on emission controls.

(2) For units with add-on NOemission controls using the optional parametric monitoring procedures in appendix C to this part, for each hour of missing NOemission rate data:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Inlet air flow rate (scfh, rounded to the nearest thousand);

(iii) Excess Oconcentration of flue gas at stack outlet (percent, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent);

(iv) Carbon monoxide concentration of flue gas at stack outlet (ppm, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(v) Temperature of flue gas at furnace exit or economizer outlet duct (&#xB0;F);

(vi) Other parameters specific to NOemission controls (e.g., average hourly reagent feedrate);

(vii) Method of determination of NOemission rate using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of § 75.57; and

(viii) Inlet and outlet NOemission rate values recorded by a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system and the removal efficiency of the add-on emission controls.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in § 75.34(d), for units with add-on SOor NOemission controls following the provisions of §§ 75.34(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or (a)(5), the owner or operator shall record:

(i) Parametric data which demonstrate, for each hour of missing SOor NOemission data, the proper operation of the add-on emission controls, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit. The parametric data shall be maintained on site and shall be submitted, upon request, to the Administrator, EPA Regional office, State, or local agency;

(ii) A flag indicating, for each hour of missing SOor NOemission data, either that the add-on emission controls are operating properly, as evidenced by all parameters being within the ranges specified in the quality assurance/quality control program, or that the add-on emission controls are not operating properly.
