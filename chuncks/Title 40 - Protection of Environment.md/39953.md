###### Applicability Statement and Basis for Waiver Approval.

17.3.4Discussion of the applicability statement and basis for approval of the waiver. This discussion should address as applicable the following: applicable regulation, emission standards, effluent characteristics, and process operations.

You can find additional information in the references in Sections 18.1 through 18.18 of this method.

1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of visible emissions (VE) from the following by-product coke oven battery sources: charging systems during charging; doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems on operating coke ovens; and collecting mains. This method is also applicable for qualifying observers for visually determining the presence of VE. In order for the test method results to be indicative of plant performance, the time of day of the run should vary.

2.1 A certified observer visually determines the VE from coke oven battery sources. Certification procedures are presented. This method does not require that opacity of emissions be determined or that magnitude be differentiated.
