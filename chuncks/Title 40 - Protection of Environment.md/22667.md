(iii) Using the values for x&#x2032; in place of the values for x, calculate the confidence interval half range at the mean x&#x2032; value as a percentage of the emission limit (CI%), the tolerance interval half range at the mean x&#x2032; value as a percentage of the emission limit (TI%), and the correlation coefficient () using the procedures described in paragraphs (1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

(4) How do I evaluate an exponential correlation for my correlation test data? To evaluate an exponential correlation, which has the form indicated by Equation 11-37, follow the procedures described in paragraphs (4)(i) through (v) of this section:

(i) Perform a logarithmic transformation of each PM concentration measurement (y values) using Equation 11-38:

(ii) Using the values for y&#x2032;in place of the values for y, perform the same procedures used to develop the linear correlation equation described in paragraph (1)(i) of this section. The resulting equation will have the form indicated by Equation 11-39.
