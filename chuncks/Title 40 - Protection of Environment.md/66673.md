##### Subpart O - Incinerators
###### ยง 264.342 Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs).

(a) Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste feed must be treated to the extent required by the performance standard of ยง 264.343.

(b)(1) One or more POHCs will be specified in the facility's permit, from among those constituents listed in part 261, appendix VIII of this chapter, for each waste feed to be burned. This specification will be based on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic constituents in the waste and on their concentration or mass in the waste feed, considering the results of waste analyses and trial burns or alternative data submitted with part B of the facility's permit application. Organic constituents which represent the greatest degree of difficulty of incineration will be those most likely to be designated as POHCs. Constituents are more likely to be designated as POHCs if they are present in large quantities or concentrations in the waste.

(2) Trial POHCs will be designated for performance of trial burns in accordance with the procedure specified in ยง 270.62 of this chapter for obtaining trial burn permits.
