####### Memorandum of Agreement.

(e)An Indian Tribe that obtains program approval must establish a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator. The Memorandum of Agreement shall be executed by the Indian Tribe's counterpart to the State Director (e.g., the Director of Tribal Environmental Office, Program or Agency). The Memorandum of Agreement must include provisions for the timely and appropriate referral to the Regional Administrator for those criminal enforcement matters where that Indian Tribe does not have the authority (e.g., those addressing criminal violations by non-Indians or violations meriting penalties over $5,000). The Agreement must also identify any enforcement agreements that may exist between the Indian Tribe and any State.
