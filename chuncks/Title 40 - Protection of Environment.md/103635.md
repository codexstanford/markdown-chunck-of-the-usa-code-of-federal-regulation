####### Interpretation of ranges.

(f)Interpret a range as a tolerance unless we explicitly identify it as an accuracy, repeatability, linearity, or noise specification. See 40 CFR 1065.1001 for the definition of tolerance. In this part, we specify two types of ranges:

(1) Whenever we specify a range by a single value and corresponding limit values above and below that value (such as X +/-Y), target the associated control point to that single value (X). Examples of this type of range include "+/-10% of maximum pressure", or "(30 +/-10) kPa". In these examples, you would target the maximum pressure or 30 kPa, respectively.

(2) Whenever we specify a range by the interval between two values, you may target any associated control point to any value within that range. An example of this type of range is "(40 to 50) kPa".
