(b)Five types of petitions exist:

(1) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program to the acceptable list.

Companies that manufacture, formulate, or use substitutes that want to have their substitutes added to the acceptable list should submit information on the substitute under the 90-day review program;

(2) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program to the unacceptable list;

(3) Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and add it to the unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the unacceptable and add it to the acceptable list;

(4) Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability listing.

(5) Petitions to grandfather use of a substitute listed as unacceptable or acceptable subject to use restrictions.
