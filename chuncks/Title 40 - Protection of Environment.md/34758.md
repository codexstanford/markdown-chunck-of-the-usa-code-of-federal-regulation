####### ยง 63.3981 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Organic HAP content

means the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating solids used for a coating calculated using Equation 2 of ยง 63.3941. The organic HAP content is determined for the coating in the condition it is in when received from its manufacturer or supplier and does not account for any alteration after receipt. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, organic HAP content is the mass of organic HAP that is emitted, rather than the organic HAP content of the coating as it is received.
