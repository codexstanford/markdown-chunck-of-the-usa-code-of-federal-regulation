() Calculations which demonstrate that total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM from all flexographic and rotogravure printing lines at the facility never exceed 90.7 Mg (100 tons) per calendar year before the application of capture systems and control devices. Total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM for a flexograhpic or rotogravure printing facility is the sum of maximum theoretical emissions of VOM from each flexographic and rotogravure printing line at the facility. The following equation shall be used to calculate total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM per calendar year before the application of capture systems and control devices for each flexographic and rotogravure printing line at the facility:

(B) On and after July 1, 1991, the owner or operator of a facility referenced in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall collect and record all of the following information each year for each printing line and maintain the information at the facility for a period of three years:
