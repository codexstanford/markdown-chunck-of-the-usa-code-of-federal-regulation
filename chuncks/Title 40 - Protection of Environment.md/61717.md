####### RS

(3) A tolerance of 0.01 parts per million is established for residues of the insecticide dinotefuran, ()-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-((tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl)guanidine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on all food and/or feed commodities (other than those covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops or inadvertent residues) when residues result from application of dinotefuran in food and/or feed handling establishments where food and/or feed products are held, stored, processed, prepared, or served. Compliance with the tolerance level is to be determined by measuring only dinotefuran.
