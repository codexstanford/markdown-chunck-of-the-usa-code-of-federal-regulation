###### Stock sodium thiosulfate solution

8.2.8(0.1 N): Prepare a stock solution by dissolving 25 g sodium thiosulfate (NaSO&#xF7; 5HO) in 1,000 mL freshly boiled, cooled, distilled water and adding 0.1 g sodium carbonate to the solution. Allow the solution to stand at least 1 day before standardizing. To standardize, accurately pipet 50 mL of potassium iodate solution (Section 8.2.7) into a 500-mL iodine flask and add 2.0 g of potassium iodide and 10 mL of 1 N HCl. Stopper the flask and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Titrate the solution with stock sodium thiosulfate solution (Section 8.2.8) to a pale yellow color. Add 5 mL of starch solution (Section 8.2.5) and titrate until the blue color just disappears. Calculate the normality (N) of the stock sodium thiosulfate solution as follows:
