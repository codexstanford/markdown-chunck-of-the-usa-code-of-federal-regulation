#### PART 266 - STANDARDS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC HAZARDOUS WASTES AND SPECIFIC TYPES OF HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
##### Subpart H - Hazardous Waste Burned in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces
###### § 266.102 Permit standards for burners.
####### Requirements to ensure compliance with the organic emissions standards,DRE standard.

(2)-(i)Operating conditions will be specified either on a case-by-case basis for each hazardous waste burned as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or by alternative data as specified in § 270.22) to be sufficient to comply with the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) performance standard of § 266.104(a) or as those special operating requirements provided by § 266.104(a)(4) for the waiver of the DRE trial burn. When the DRE trial burn is not waived under § 266.104(a)(4), each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the hazardous waste (including acceptable variations in the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous waste which will not affect compliance with the DRE performance standard) to which the operating requirements apply. For each such hazardous waste, the permit will specify acceptable operating limits including, but not limited to, the following conditions as appropriate:

(A) Feed rate of hazardous waste and other fuels measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;

(B) Minimum and maximum device production rate when producing normal product expressed in appropriate units, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;

(C) Appropriate controls of the hazardous waste firing system;

(D) Allowable variation in boiler and industrial furnace system design or operating procedures;

(E) Minimum combustion gas temperature measured at a location indicative of combustion chamber temperature, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section;

(F) An appropriate indicator of combustion gas velocity, measured and specified as prescribed in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, unless documentation is provided under § 270.66 of this chapter demonstrating adequate combustion gas residence time; and

(G) Such other operating requirements as are necessary to ensure that the DRE performance standard of § 266.104(a) is met.
