###### § 75.58 General recordkeeping provisions for specific situations.
####### Specific SO,NO,and CO,record provisions for gas-fired or oil-fired units using the optional low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19.

(f),,In lieu of recording the information in §§ 75.57(b) through (e), the owner or operator shall record the following information for each affected low mass emissions unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19(c):

(1) All low mass emission units shall report for each hour:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Unit operating time (units using the long term fuel flow methodology report operating time to be 1);

(iii) Fuel type (pipeline natural gas, natural gas, other gaseous fuel, residual oil, or diesel fuel). If more than one type of fuel is combusted in the hour, either:

(A) Indicate the fuel type which results in the highest emission factors for NO(this option is in effect through December 31, 2008); or

(B) Indicate the fuel type resulting in the highest emission factor for each parameter (SO, NOemission rate, and CO) separately (this option is required on and after January 1, 2009);

(iv) Average hourly NOemission rate (lb/mmBtu, rounded to the nearest thousandth);

(v) Hourly NOmass emissions (lbs, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vi) Hourly SOmass emissions (lbs, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vii) Hourly COmass emissions (tons, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(viii) Hourly calculated unit heat input in mmBtu;

(ix) Hourly unit output in gross load or steam load;

(x) The method of determining hourly heat input: unit maximum rated heat input, unit long term fuel flow or group long term fuel flow;

(xi) The method of determining NOemission rate used for the hour: default based on fuel combusted, unit specific default based on testing or historical data, group default based on representative testing of identical units, unit specific based on testing of a unit with NOcontrols operating, or missing data value;

(xii) Control status of the unit; and

(xiii) Base or peak load indicator (as applicable); and

(xiv) Multiple fuel flag.

(2) Low mass emission units using the optional long term fuel flow methodology to determine unit heat input shall report for each quarter:

(i) Type of fuel;

(ii) Beginning date and hour of long term fuel flow measurement period;

(iii) End date and hour of long term fuel flow period;

(iv) Quantity of fuel measured;

(v) Units of measure;

(vi) Fuel GCV value used to calculate heat input;

(vii) Units of GCV;

(viii) Method of determining fuel GCV used;

(ix) Method of determining fuel flow over period;

(x) Monitoring-system identification code;

(xi) Quarter and year;

(xii) Total heat input (mmBtu); and

(xiii) Operating hours in period.
