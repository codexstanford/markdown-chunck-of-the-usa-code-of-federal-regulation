####### Survey of Current Business

(b) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the post-closure cost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instrument(s) used to comply with § 265.145. For owners or operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the post-closure care cost estimate must be updated for inflation no later than 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to the Regional Administrator as specified in § 265.145(d)(5). The adjustment may be made by recalculating the post-closure cost estimate in current dollars or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in itsas specified in § 265.145 (b)(1) and (2). The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.

(1) The first adjustment is made by multiplying the post-closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted post-closure cost estimate.

(2) Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.

(c) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the post-closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after a revision to the post-closure plan which increases the cost of post-closure care. If the owner or operator has an approved post-closure plan, the post-closure cost estimate must be revised no later than 30 days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify the plan, if the change in the post-closure plan increases the cost of post-closure care. The revised post-closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in § 265.144(b).

(d) The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of the facility: the latest post-closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with § 265.144 (a) and (c) and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with § 265.144(b), the latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate.
