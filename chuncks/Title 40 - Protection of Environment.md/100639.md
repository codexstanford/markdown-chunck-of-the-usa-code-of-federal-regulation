###### ยง 1039.110 Recording reductant use and other diagnostic functions.

(a) Engines equipped with SCR systems using a reductant other than the engine's fuel must have a diagnostic system that monitors reductant quality and tank levels and alert operators to the need to refill the reductant tank before it is empty, or to replace the reductant if it does not meet your concentration specifications. Unless we approve other alerts, use a warning lamp or an audible alarm. You do not need to separately monitor reductant quality if your system uses input from an exhaust NOsensor (or other sensor) to alert operators when reductant quality is inadequate. However, tank level must be monitored in all cases.

(b) You may equip your engine with other diagnostic features. If you do, they must be designed to allow us to read and interpret the codes. Note that ยง 1039.205 requires you to provide us any information needed to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units.
