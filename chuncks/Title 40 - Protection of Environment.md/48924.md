(2) A CAIR SOunit shall be subject to the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the control period starting on the later of January 1, 2010 or the deadline for meeting the unit's monitor certification requirements under ยง 96.270(b)(1), (2), or (5) and for each control period thereafter.

(6) A CAIR SOallowance does not constitute a property right.

(7) Upon recordation by the Administrator under subpart FFF, GGG, or III of this part, every allocation, transfer, or deduction of a CAIR SOallowance to or from a CAIR SOsource's compliance account is incorporated automatically in any CAIR permit of the source.
