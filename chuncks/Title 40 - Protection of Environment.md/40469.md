####### Instrumentation system

means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (for example, composition, pressure, flow). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller in diameter and connectors nominally 0.75 inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of subpart F of this part.
