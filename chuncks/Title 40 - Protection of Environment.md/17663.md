(4) As of January 1, 2012, and within 90 days after the date of completing each performance test, as defined in ยง 60.8, conducted to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must submit relative accuracy test audit (reference method) data and performance test (compliance test) data, except opacity data, electronically to EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) by using the Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see) or other compatible electronic spreadsheet. Only data collected using test methods compatible with ERT are subject to this requirement to be submitted electronically into EPA's WebFire database.

(w) The owner or operator using a SO, NO, CO, and OCEMS to meet the requirements of this subpart shall install, certify, operate, and maintain the CEMS as specified in paragraphs (w)(1) through (w)(5) of this section.

(1) Except as provided for under paragraphs (w)(2), (w)(3), and (w)(4) of this section, each SO, NO, CO, and OCEMS required under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section shall be installed, certified, and operated in accordance with the applicable procedures in Performance Specification 2 or 3 in appendix B to this part or according to the procedures in appendices A and B to part 75 of this chapter. Daily calibration drift assessments and quarterly accuracy determinations shall be done in accordance with Procedure 1 in appendix F to this part, and a data assessment report (DAR), prepared according to section 7 of Procedure 1 in appendix F to this part, shall be submitted with each compliance report required under ยง 60.51Da.

(2) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (w)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures. For all required COand OCEMS and for SOand NOCEMS with span values greater than or equal to 100 ppm, the daily calibration error test and calibration adjustment procedures described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter may be followed instead of the CD assessment procedures in Procedure 1, section 4.1 of appendix F of this part. If this option is selected, the data validation and out-of-control provisions in sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive CD and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to this part. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the excessive CD and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to this part shall apply to SOand NOspan values less than 100 ppm;

(3) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (w)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to may elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures. For all required COand OCEMS and for SOand NOCEMS with span values greater than 30 ppm, quarterly linearity checks may be performed in accordance with section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, instead of performing the cylinder gas audits (CGAs) described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of the linearity checks shall be as specified in section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable linearity specifications in section 3.2 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.2.4 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the cylinder gas audits described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part shall be performed for SOand NOspan values less than or equal to 30 ppm;

(4) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (w)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to may elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures. For SO, CO, and OCEMS and for NOCEMS, RATAs may be performed in accordance with section 2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter instead of following the procedures described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.1 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.3.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO(regardless of the SOemission level during the RATA), and for NOwhen the average NOemission rate measured by the reference method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu;

(5) If the owner or operator elects to implement the alternative data assessment procedures described in paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) of this section, each data assessment report shall include a summary of the results of all of the RATAs, linearity checks, CGAs, and calibration error or drift assessments required by paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) of this section.
