(6)After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source with equipment in a pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit that is also part of an affected source under subpart PPP of this part may elect to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1254 by controlling all process vents in accordance with § 63.1425 (b), (c)(1), (c)(3), (d), and/or (f).

For any pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit controlled in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1425, the owner or operator must also comply with all other requirements in subpart PPP of this part. In the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1260(f), the owner or operator shall identify which pharmaceutical manufacturing process units are meeting the control requirements for process vents and all other requirements of subpart PPP of this part, and the owner or operator shall describe the calculations and other information used to identify which process vents must be controlled to comply with the percent reduction requirements of § 63.1254, if applicable.

(i) For the purposes of establishing whether a person is in violation of this subpart, nothing in this subpart shall preclude the use of any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements.
