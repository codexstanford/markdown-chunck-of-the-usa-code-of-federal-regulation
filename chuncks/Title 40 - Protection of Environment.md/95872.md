####### Test chambers

(ii)(exposure chambers). (A) Stainless steel test chambers should be welded or glued with silicone adhesive, and not soldered. Glass should be fused or bonded using clear silicone adhesive. Epoxy glues are not recommended, but if used ample curing time should be allowed prior to use. As little adhesive as possible should be in contact with the water.

(B) Many different sizes of test chambers have been used successfully. The size, shape and depth of the test chamber is acceptable if the specified flow rate and loading requirements can be achieved.

(C) The actual arrangement of the test chambers can be important to the statistical analysis of the test data. Test chambers can be arranged totally on one level (tier) side by side, or on two levels with each level having one of the replicate test substance concentrations or controls. Regardless of the arrangement, it shall be reported in detail and considered in the data analysis.
