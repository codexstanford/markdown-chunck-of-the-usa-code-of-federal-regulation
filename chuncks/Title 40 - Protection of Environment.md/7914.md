####### Compliance determination for SO,limit for the converters.

(ii)The 365-day rolling SOemission control efficiency for the converters shall be calculated separately for the primary capture system and the secondary capture system for each calendar day in accordance with the following procedure: Step one, sum the hourly pounds of SOvented to each uncontrolled bypass stack and to each control device used to control emissions from the converters for the current calendar day and the preceding three-hundred-sixty-four (364) calendar days, to calculate the total pounds of pre-control SOemissions over the most recent three-hundred-sixty-five (365) calendar day period; Step two, sum the hourly pounds of SOvented to each uncontrolled bypass stack and emitted from the release point of each control device used to control emissions from the converters for the current calendar day and the preceding three-hundred-sixty-four (364) calendar days, to calculate the total pounds of post-control SOemissions over the most recent three-hundred-sixty-five (365) calendar day period; Step three, divide the total amount of post-control SOemissions calculated from Step two by the total amount of pre-control SOemissions calculated from Step one, subtract the resulting ratio from one, and multiply the difference by 100 percent to calculate the 365-day rolling SOemission control efficiency as a percentage.
