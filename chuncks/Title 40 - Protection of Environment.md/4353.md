3.1 The approximate concentration range of the method is 2 to 750 Âµg/std m. The upper limit is determined by the point at which the sampler can no longer maintain the specified flow rate due to the increased pressure drop of the loaded filter. This point is affected by particle size distribution, moisture content of the collected particles, and variability from filter to filter, among other things. The lower limit is determined by the sensitivity of the balance (see Section 7.10) and by inherent sources of error (see Section 6).
