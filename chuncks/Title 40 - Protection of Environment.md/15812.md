######## Calculations.

(g)(1) Record the PM concentration for each test sampler for each test period as C, where i is the sampler number (i = 1,2,3) and j is the test period (j = 1,2, * * * 10).

(2)(i) For each test period, calculate and record the average of the three measured PM concentrations as Cwhere j is the test period using equation 26 of this section:

(ii) If C<3 µg/mfor any test period, data from that test period are unacceptable, and an additional sample collection set must be obtained to replace the unacceptable data.

(3)(i) Calculate and record the precision for each of the 10 test periods, as the standard deviation, using equation 27 of this section:

(ii) For each of the 10 test periods, also calculate and record the precision as the relative standard deviation, in percent, using equation 28 of this section:
