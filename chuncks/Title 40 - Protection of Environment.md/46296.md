####### Required testing for all engines.

(iii)(A) Other emission control systems. The manufacturer must conduct demonstration tests for all other emission control components (e.g., hydrocarbon traps, adsorbers) designed and calibrated to a malfunction limit based on an emissions threshold based on the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section.

(B) For each of the testing requirements of paragraph (l)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, if the manufacturer has established that only a functional check is required because no failure or deterioration of the specific tested system could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the manufacturer is not required to perform a demonstration test; however, the manufacturer is required to provide the data and/or engineering analysis used to determine that only a functional test of the system(s) is required.

(iv) The manufacturer may electronically simulate deteriorated components but shall not make any engine control unit modifications when performing demonstration tests unless approved by the Administrator. All equipment necessary to duplicate the demonstration test must be made available to the Administrator upon request.
