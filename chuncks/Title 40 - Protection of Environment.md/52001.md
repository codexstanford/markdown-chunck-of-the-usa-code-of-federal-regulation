####### Destruction or removal efficiency (DRE)

means the efficiency of an abatement system to destroy or remove fluorinated GHGs, NO, or both. The destruction or removal efficiency is equal to one minus the ratio of the mass of all relevant GHGs exiting the abatement system to the mass of GHG entering the abatement system. When GHGs are formed in an abatement system, destruction or removal efficiency is expressed as one minus the ratio of amounts of exiting GHGs to the amounts entering the system in units of CO-equivalents (COe).
