###### What corrective action must I take if my COMS is malfunctioning?

10.5You must have a corrective action program in place to address the repair and/or maintenance of your COMS. The corrective action program must address routine/preventative maintenance and various types of analyzer repairs. The corrective action program must establish what diagnostic testing must be performed after each type of activity to ensure that the COMS is collecting valid, quality-assured data. Recommended maintenance and repair procedures and diagnostic testing after repairs may be found in an associated guidance document.
