(1) Perform a CHresponse factor determination as described in paragraph (d) of this section. If the resulting value ofis within +/-5% of its most recent previously determined value, the THC FID passes the CHresponse verification. For example, if the most recent previous value forwas 1.05 and it increased by 0.05 to become 1.10 or it decreased by 0.05 to become 1.00, either case would be acceptable because +/-4.8% is less than +/-5%.
