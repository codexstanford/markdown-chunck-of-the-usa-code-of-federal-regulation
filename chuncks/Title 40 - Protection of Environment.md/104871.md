####### E15 misfueling mitigation survey requirement.

(a)(1) Any gasoline manufacturer, oxygenate blender, or oxygenate producer that produces, introduces into commerce, sells, or offers for sale E15, gasoline, BOB, DFE, or gasoline-ethanol blended fuel that is intended for use in or as E15 must comply with either survey program Option 1 (as specified in paragraph (b) of this section) or Option 2 (as specified in paragraph (c) of this section).

(2) For an oxygenate producer that produces or imports DFE, the DFE is deemed as intended for use in E15 unless the oxygenate producer demonstrates that it was not intended for such use. The oxygenate producer may demonstrate, at a minimum, that DFE is not intended for use in E15 by including language on PTDs stating that the DFE is not intended for use in E15, entering into contracts with oxygenate blenders to limit the use of their DFE to gasoline-ethanol blended fuels of no more than 10 volume percent, and limiting the concentration of their DFE to no more than 10 volume percent in their fuel additive registration under 40 CFR part 79.
