####### H,H,H,H,H,H

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of indoxacarb, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of indoxacarb, (S)-methyl-7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2e] [1,3,4]oxadiazine-4a(3)-carboxylate, its R-enantiomer, (R)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno [1,2-e] [1,3,4] oxadiazine-4a(3)-carboxylate, and the metabolites: IN-JT333, methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-e][1,3,4]oxadiazine-4a(3)-carboxylate; IN-KT319, (E)-methyl 5-chloro-2,3,-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]-carbonyl]hydrazono]-1-indene-2-carboxylate; IN-JU873, methyl 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[[4-(triflurormethoxy)-phenyl]amino]carbonyl]hydrazono]-1-indene-2-carboxylate; IN-KG433, methyl 5-chloro-2,3,-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]-hydrazono]-1-indene-2-carboxylate; and IN-KB687, methyl [4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of indoxacarb in the commodity.
