####### Process condenser

means a condenser whose primary purpose is to recover material as an integral part of a process. The condenser must support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of source equipment operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are included in this definition.
