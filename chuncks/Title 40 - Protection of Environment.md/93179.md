(i) The polymer is a solid material that is not soluble or dispersible in water and will be used only in the solid phase (e.g., polymers that will be used as ion exchange beads), or

(ii) The combined (total) functional group equivalent weight of cationic groups in the polymer is equal to or greater than 5,000.
