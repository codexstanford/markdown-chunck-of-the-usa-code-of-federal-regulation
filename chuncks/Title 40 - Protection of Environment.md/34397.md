####### § 63.3491 What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
######## Emission rate with add-on controls option.

(c)Demonstrate that, based on the coatings and thinners used in the coating operation(s) and the emission reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, calculated as a rolling 12-month emission rate and determined on a monthly basis. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) used for purposes of complying with this subpart meet the operating limits required in § 63.3492, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3541(i), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.3493. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3540 through 63.3547 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
