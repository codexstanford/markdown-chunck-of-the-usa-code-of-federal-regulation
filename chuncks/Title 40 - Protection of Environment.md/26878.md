####### Drain system

means the system used to convey wastewater streams from a process unit, product storage tank, or feed storage tank to a waste management unit. The term includes all process drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations, down to the receiving waste management unit. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other drain systems, is excluded from this definition.
