####### Route of administration.

(iii)(A) The test substance is usually administered by the oral route (diet, drinking water, or gavage).

(B) If administered by gavage or dermal application, the dosage administered to each animal prior to mating and during gestation and lactation shall be based on the individual animal body weight and adjusted weekly at a minimum.

(C) If another route of administration is used, for example, when the route of administration is based upon the principal route of potential human exposure, the tester should provide justification and reasoning for its selection, and appropriate modifications may be necessary. Care should be taken to minimize stress on the maternal animals and their litters during gestation and lactation.

(D) All animals should be dosed by the same method during the appropriate experimental period.
