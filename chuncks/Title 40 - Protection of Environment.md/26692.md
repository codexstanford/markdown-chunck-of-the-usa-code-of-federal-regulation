####### Halogenated emissions.

(c)Halogenated Group 1 batch front-end process vents, halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, and halogenated continuous front-end process vents that are combusted as part of complying with paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, shall be controlled according to either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.

(1) If a combustion device is used to comply with paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section for a halogenated batch front-end process vent or halogenated aggregate batch vent stream, the emissions exiting the combustion device shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device that reduces overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens by at least 99 percent before discharge to the atmosphere.

(2) A halogen reduction device may be used to reduce the halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 3,750 kg/yr for batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams and thus make the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream nonhalogenated. The nonhalogenated batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall then comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.

(d) If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, the batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.
