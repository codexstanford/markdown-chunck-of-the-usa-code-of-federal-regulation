###### Sorbent Trap

3.7means a cartridge or sleeve containing a sorbent media (typically activated carbon treated with iodine or some other halogen) with multiple sections separated by an inert material such as glass wool. These sorbent traps are optimized for the quantitative capture of elemental and oxidized forms of Hg and can be analyzed by multiple techniques.
