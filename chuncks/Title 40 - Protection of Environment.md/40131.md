###### Sample Conditioning.

6.17One option is a condenser system, which is used for moisture removal. This can be helpful in the measurement of some analytes. Other sample conditioning procedures may be devised for the removal of moisture or other interfering species.

6.17.1 The analyte spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method, the QA spike procedure of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the validation procedure of section 13 of this method demonstrate whether the sample conditioning affects analyte concentrations. Alternatively, measurements can be made with two parallel FTIR systems; one measuring conditioned sample, the other measuring unconditioned sample.

6.17.2 Another option is sample dilution. The dilution factor measurement must be documented and accounted for in the reported concentrations. An alternative to dilution is to lower the sensitivity of the FTIR system by decreasing the cell path length, or to use a short-path cell in conjunction with a long path cell to measure more than one concentration range.
