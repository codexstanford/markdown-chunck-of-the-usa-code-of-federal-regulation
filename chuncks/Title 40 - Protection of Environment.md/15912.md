####### § 53.65 Test procedure: Loading test.
######## Overview.

(a)(1) The loading tests are designed to quantify any appreciable changes in a candidate method sampler's performance as a function of coarse aerosol collection. The candidate sampler is exposed to a mass of coarse aerosol equivalent to sampling a mass concentration of 150 µg/mover the time period that the manufacturer has specified between periodic cleaning. After loading, the candidate sampler is then evaluated by performing the test in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or § 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the acceptance criteria are met for this evaluation test, then the candidate sampler is approved for multi-day sampling with the periodic maintenance schedule as specified by the candidate method. For example, if the candidate sampler passes the reevaluation tests following loading with an aerosol mass equivalent to sampling a 150 µg/maerosol continuously for 7 days, then the sampler is approved for 7 day field operation before cleaning is required.
