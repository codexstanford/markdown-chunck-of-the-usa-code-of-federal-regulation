####### Limited exemption for invalid B-RINs verified during the interim period.

(e)(1) In the event that an obligated party is required to retire or replace an invalid RIN that is a B-RIN pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the obligated party will be afforded a "limited exemption" (LE) equal to two percent of its annual Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) for calendar years 2013 and 2014 during the interim period.

(3) If the number of invalidly generated B-RINs required to be retired or replaced in a calendar year is less than or equal to LE as calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the entire RIN retirement obligation is excused.

(4) If the number of invalidly generated B-RINs required to be retired or replaced in a calendar year is greater than LE as calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the retirement of a number of B-RINs equal to two percent of the obligated party's RVO is excused.
