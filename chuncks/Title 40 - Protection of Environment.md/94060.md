####### Treatability Study

means a study in which PCB waste is subjected to a treatment process to determine:

(1) Whether the waste is amenable to the treatment process;

(2) What pretreatment (if any) is required;

(3) The optimal process conditions needed to achieve the desired treatment;

(4) The efficiency of a treatment process for the specific type of waste (i.e., soil, sludge, liquid, etc.); or,

(5) The characteristics and volumes of residuals from a particular treatment process. A "treatability study" is not a mechanism to commercially treat or dispose of PCB waste. Treatment is a form of disposal under this part.
