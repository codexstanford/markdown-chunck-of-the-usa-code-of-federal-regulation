3.5.2.8 When the desired concentrations are prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 test(previously transferred into 200 ml of medium). This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test chamber. A pair of standard cover glass forceps with flat, bent ends is an ideal tool for handling and tipping the small beaker without risk of contaminating the medium.

3.5.2.9 After adding the test animals, incubate the test beakers at 25+/-1 &#xB0;C for 48 hours. Recommended lighting is 2,000 lumens/m(200 ft-c) of diffused, constant, fluorescent illumination.

3.5.2.10 Wash the blender thoroughly after use and repeat the above procedures for each series of tests. Wash the blender as follows: rinse with normal hexane; pour a strong solution of laboratory detergent into the blender to cover the blades; fill the container to about half of its volume with hot tap water; operate the blender for about 30 seconds at high speed; remove and rinse twice with hot tap water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed; and then rinse twice with distilled water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed.
