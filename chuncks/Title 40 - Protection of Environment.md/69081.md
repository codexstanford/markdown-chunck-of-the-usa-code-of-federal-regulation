####### Policing the security interest or loan.

(i)(A) A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not together with other actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in ยง 280.210(a). Such policing actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest; securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located (including on-site inspections) in which indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower).

(B) Policing activities also include undertaking by the holder of UST environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions taken in compliance with this part, provided that the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or daily operation of the UST or UST system as provided in ยง 280.210(a) and ยง 280.230. Such allowable actions include, but are not limited to, release detection and release reporting, release response and corrective action, temporary or permanent closure of an UST or UST system, UST upgrading or replacement, and maintenance of corrosion protection. A holder who undertakes these actions must do so in compliance with the applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. A holder may directly oversee these environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions, and directly hire contractors to perform the work, and is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system.
