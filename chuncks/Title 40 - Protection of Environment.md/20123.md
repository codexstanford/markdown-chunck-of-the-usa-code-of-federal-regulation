####### ยง 60.1640 What must I do if I plan to permanently close my municipal waste combustion unit and not restart it?

(a) If you plan to close your municipal waste combustion unit rather than comply with the State plan, you must submit a closure notification, including the date of closure, to the Administrator by the date your final control plan is due.

(b) If the closure date is later than 1 year after the effective date of State plan approval, you must enter into a legally binding closure agreement with the Administrator by the date your final control plan is due. The agreement must specify the date by which operation will cease.
