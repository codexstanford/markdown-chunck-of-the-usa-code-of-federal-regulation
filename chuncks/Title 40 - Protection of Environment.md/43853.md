###### ยง 80.1426 How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel?
####### Renewable fuel produced from separated yard waste, separated food waste, and separated MSW.

(5)(i)(A) Separated yard waste is deemed to be composed entirely of cellulosic materials.

(B) Separated food waste is deemed to be composed entirely of non-cellulosic materials, unless a party demonstrates that a portion of the feedstock is cellulosic through approval of their facility registration.

(ii)(A) A feedstock qualifies as separated yard waste or separated food waste only if it is collected according to a plan submitted to and accepted by EPA under the registration procedures specified in ยง 80.1450(b)(1)(vii).

(B) A feedstock qualifies as separated MSW only if it is collected according to a plan submitted to and approved by EPA.

(iii) Separation and recycling actions for separated MSW are considered to occur if:

(A) Recyclable paper, cardboard, plastics, rubber, textiles, metals, and glass that can be recycled are separated and removed from the municipal solid waste stream to the extent reasonably practicable according to a plan submitted to and approved by U.S. EPA under the registration procedures specified in ยง 80.1450(b)(1)(viii); and

(B) The fuel producer has evidence of all contracts relating to the disposition of paper, cardboard, plastics, rubber, textiles, metals, and glass that are recycled.

(iv)(A) The number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel derived from separated yard waste shall be equal to a volume Vand is calculated according to the following formula:

(B) The number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel derived from separated food waste shall be equal to a volume Vand is calculated according to the following formula:

(v) The number of cellulosic biofuel gallon-RINs that shall be generated for the cellulosic portion of a batch of renewable fuel derived from separated MSW shall be determined according to the following formula:
