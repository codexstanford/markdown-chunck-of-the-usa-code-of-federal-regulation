####### Inductive System Coils.

(9)(i) The emission-critical parameters for inductive system coils are:

(A) Open Circuit Voltage Output.

(B) Dielectric Strength.

(C) Flashover.

(D) Rise Time.

(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph:

(A) "Coil" means a device used to provide high voltage in an inductive ignition system.

(B) "Flashover" means the discharge of ignition voltage across the coil.

(C) "Dielectric Strength" means the ability of the material of the coil to resist electrical breakdown.

(D) "Rise Time" means the time required for the spark voltage to increase from 10% to 90% of its maximum value.
