######## Sulfur recovery unit

means a process unit that recovers elemental sulfur from gases that contain reduced sulfur compounds and other pollutants, usually by a vapor-phase catalytic reaction of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This definition does not include a unit where the modified reaction is carried out in a water solution which contains a metal ion capable of oxidizing the sulfide ion to sulfur, e.g., the LO-CAT II process.
