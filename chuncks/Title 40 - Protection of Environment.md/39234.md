####### ยง 63.11501 What are the notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, and how may I assert an affirmative defense for violation of emission standards during malfunction?
######## Report.

(2)If you seek to assert an affirmative defense, you must submit a written report to the Administrator, with all necessary supporting documentation, that you have met the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report must be included in the first periodic compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.
