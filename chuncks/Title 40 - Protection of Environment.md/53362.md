Areaboveground oil storage tanks or groups of aboveground oil storage tanks at the facilityadequate secondary containment?

B.2.1 If the answer is yes, the final worst case volume equals the total aboveground oil storage capacity without adequate secondary containment plus the production volume of the well with the highest output at the facility.

(1) For facilities with production wells producing by pumping, if the rate of the well with the highest output is known and the number of days the facility is unattended can be predicted, then the production volume is equal to the pumping rate of the well multiplied by the greatest number of days the facility is unattended.

(2) If the pumping rate of the well with the highest output is estimated or the maximum number of days the facility is unattended is estimated, then the production volume is determined from the pumping rate of the well multiplied by 1.5 times the greatest number of days that the facility has been or is expected to be unattended.

(3) Attachment D-1 to this appendix provides methods for calculating the production volumes for exploratory wells and production wells producing under pressure.

(A) FINAL WORST CASE VOLUME: ____ GAL

(B) Do not proceed further.
