(a) The last sentence of section 3(1) of Kentucky regulation 401 KAR 3:050, which specifies that a new fossil fuel fired steam electric generator's allowable SOemissions may be calculated by averaging SOemissions from existing units of this type and from new ones, is disapproved since it contravenes subpart D of 40 CFR part 60, New Source Performance Standards.

(b) Section 8(2)(a) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in that it allows the Tennessee Valley Authority's Shawnee power plant until October 1, 1981, to achieve compliance with emissions limits which are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part D revisions, and which the source was previously required to meet by July 1, 1977.

(c) Section 8(2)(d) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in that it allows sources until December 31, 1982, to achieve compliance with emission limits which are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part D revisions, and which the sources were previously required to meet prior to 1979.
