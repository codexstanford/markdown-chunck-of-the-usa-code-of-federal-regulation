The first semiannual reporting period begins on the compliance date for your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever date immediately follows your compliance date. Each subsequent semiannual reporting period for which you must submit a semiannual compliance report begins on July 1 or January 1 and ends 6 calendar months later. Before March 1, 2019, as required by § 63.10(e)(3), you must begin submitting quarterly compliance reports if you deviate from the emission limits in § 63.2983 or the operating limits in § 63.2984. After February 28, 2019, you are not required to submit quarterly compliance reports. If you deviate from the emission limits in § 63.2983 or the operating limits in § 63.2984 in the quarter prior to February 28, 2019, you must include this information in the report for the first full semiannual reporting period following February 28, 2019.
