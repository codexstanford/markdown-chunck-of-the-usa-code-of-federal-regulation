####### ยง 257.70 Design criteria for new CCR landfills and any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill.
######## leachate collection and removal system

(d) Themust be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove leachate from the landfill during the active life and post-closure care period. The leachate collection and removal system must be:

(1) Designed and operated to maintain less than a 30-centimeter depth of leachate over the composite liner or alternative composite liner;

(2) Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the CCR and any non-CCR waste managed in the CCR unit and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying waste, waste cover materials, and equipment used at the CCR unit; and

(3) Designed and operated to minimize clogging during the active life and post-closure care period.

(e) Prior to construction of the CCR landfill or any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill, the owner or operator must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer or approval from the Participating State Director or approval from EPA where EPA is the permitting authority that the design of the composite liner (or, if applicable, alternative composite liner) and the leachate collection and removal system meets the requirements of this section.

(f) Upon completion of construction of the CCR landfill or any lateral expansion of a CCR landfill, the owner or operator must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer or approval from the Participating State Director or approval from EPA where EPA is the permitting authority that the design of the composite liner (or, if applicable, alternative composite liner) and the leachate collection and removal system have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(g) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in ยง 257.105(f), the notification requirements specified in ยง 257.106(f), and the Internet requirements specified in ยง 257.107(f).
