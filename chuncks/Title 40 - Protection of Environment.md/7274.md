() Reasonable notice is given to the Administrator prior to the relocation identifying the proposed new location and the probable duration of operation at the new location. Such notice shall be given to the Administrator not less than 10 days in advance of the proposed relocation unless a different time duration is previously approved by the Administrator.

(2) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates that, as to that pollutant, the source or modification is located in an area designated as nonattainment under section 107 of the Act. Nonattainment designations for revoked NAAQS, as contained in 40 CFR part 81, shall not be viewed as current designations under section 107 of the Act for purposes of determining the applicability of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section to a major stationary source or major modification after the revocation of that NAAQS is effective.

(3) The requirements of paragraphs (k), (m) and (o) of this section shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant, if the allowable emissions of that pollutant from the source, or the net emissions increase of that pollutant from the modification:

(i) Would impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated, and

(ii) Would be temporary.

(4) The requirements of paragraphs (k), (m) and (o) of this section as they relate to any maximum allowable increase for a Class II area shall not apply to a major modification at a stationary source that was in existence on March 1, 1978, if the net increase in allowable emissions of each regulated NSR pollutant from the modification after the application of best available control technology would be less than 50 tons per year.

(5) The Administrator may exempt a stationary source or modification from the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section, with respect to monitoring for a particular pollutant if:

(i) The emissions increase of the pollutant from the new source or the net emissions increase of the pollutant from the modification would cause, in any area, air quality impacts less than the following amounts:
