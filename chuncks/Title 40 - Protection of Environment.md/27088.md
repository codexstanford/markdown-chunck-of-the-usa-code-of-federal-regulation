####### Carbon adsorbers with vacuum regeneration.

(2)Monitor and record the regeneration time for carbon bed regeneration and monitor and record continuously the vacuum pressure of the carbon bed regeneration cycle. The owner or operator will record the time when the carbon bed regeneration cycle begins and when the cycle ends for a single carbon bed and will calculate a 3-cycle block average every third cycle. The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a recording pressure measurement device (magnehelic gauge or equivalent device). A data acquisition system shall record and compute a 3-cycle (carbon bed regeneration cycle) block average vacuum pressure every third cycle. The owner or operator shall verify the accuracy of the pressure device once each calendar year with a reference pressure monitor (traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards or an independent pressure measurement device dedicated for this purpose). During accuracy checking, the probe of the reference device shall be at the same location as that of the pressure monitor being tested.
