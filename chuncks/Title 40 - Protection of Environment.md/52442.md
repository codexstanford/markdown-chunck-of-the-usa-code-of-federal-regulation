Equipment with a unique physical volume of less than 50 cubic feet as determined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section are not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(2) through (4) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph (i) do not apply to blowdown vent stack emissions from depressurizing to a flare, over-pressure relief, operating pressure control venting, blowdown of non-GHG gases, and desiccant dehydrator blowdown venting before reloading.
