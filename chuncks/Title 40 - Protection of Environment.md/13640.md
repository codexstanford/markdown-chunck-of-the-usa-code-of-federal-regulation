####### Regional Haze.

(d)The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Michigan on November 5, 2010, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOand SOfrom electric generating units. EPA has given limited approval and limited disapproval to the plan provisions addressing these requirements.
