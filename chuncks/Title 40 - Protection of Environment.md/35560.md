(1) All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.4883. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4961(j), you must conduct a performance test of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in §§ 63.4963, 63.4964, and 63.4965, and establish the operating limits required by § 63.4892, no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.4883.
