######## i.e.,

(D) In the event that the "above span" calibration is not successful (the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the "above span" calibration for reporting based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in equation 6:

(2) Compliance with the mercury emissions limit must be determined using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to the following requirements:

(i) You must operate a mercury CEMS in accordance with performance specification 12A at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system in accordance with performance specification 12B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; these monitoring systems must be quality assured according to procedure 5 of 40 CFR 60, appendix F. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. If you choose to comply with the production-rate based mercury limit for your waste-burning kiln, you must also monitor hourly clinker production and determine the hourly mercury emissions rate in pounds per million ton of clinker produced. You must demonstrate compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a 30-day rolling average of these 1-hour mercury concentrations or mass emissions rates, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this part. CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content;

(ii) Owners or operators using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system to determine mass emission rate must install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the mercury mass emissions rate to the atmosphere according to the requirements of performance specification 6 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B and conducting an annual relative accuracy test of the continuous emission rate monitoring system according to section 8.2 of performance specification 6; and

(iii) The owner or operator of a waste-burning kiln must demonstrate initial compliance by operating a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is operating under normal conditions and including at least one period when the raw mill is off.

(k) If you use an air pollution control device to meet the emission limitations in this subpart, you must conduct an initial and annual inspection of the air pollution control device. The inspection must include, at a minimum, the following:

(1) Inspect air pollution control device(s) for proper operation; and

(2) Develop a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements in paragraph (l) of this section. This requirement also applies to you if you petition the EPA Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under ยง 60.13(i).

(l) For each CMS required in this section, you must develop and submit to the EPA Administrator for approval a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements of this paragraph (l) that addresses paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section:

(1) You must submit this site-specific monitoring plan at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation of your continuous monitoring system:
