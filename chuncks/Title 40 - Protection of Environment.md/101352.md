###### ยง 1045.115 What other requirements apply?
####### Defeat devices.

(g)You may not equip your engines with a defeat device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device that reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation and use. This does not apply for altitude kits installed or removed consistent with ยง 1045.655. This also does not apply to auxiliary emission control devices you identify in your application for certification if any of the following is true:

(1) The conditions of concern were substantially included in the applicable duty-cycle test procedures described in subpart F of this part.

(2) You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or vessel) damage or accidents. For example, you may design your engine to include emergency operating modes (sometimes known as limp-home operation) that would allow a vessel to return to land in the event of a malfunction even if such operating modes result in higher emissions.

(3) The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.
