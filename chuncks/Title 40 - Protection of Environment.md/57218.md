####### Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities.

(h)An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one injection well. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each injection well, the EPA Identification Number, name, address, and the amount of funds for plugging and abandonment assured by the mechanism. If the injection wells covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each injection well. In directing funds available through the mechanism for plugging and abandonment of any of the injection wells covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that injection well, unless the owner or operator agrees to use additional funds available under the mechanism.
