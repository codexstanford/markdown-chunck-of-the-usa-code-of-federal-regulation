(3) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. The owner or operator may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, "Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses (incorporated by reference-ยง 60.17) as an alternative to Method 3B of appendix A-2 of this part.

(4) Method 4 of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.

(5) Method 5, 5B or 5D of appendix A-4 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine the PM concentration as follows:

(i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). Sampling shall begin no less than 30 minutes after startup and shall terminate before shutdown procedures begin. A minimum of three valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.

(ii) Method 5 of appendix A of this part shall be used only to test emissions from affected facilities without wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems.

(iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part is to be used only after wet FGD systems.
