####### Construction materials.

(ii)Construction materials and commercially purchased equipment that may contact the stock solution, test solution, or dilution water should not contain substances that can be leached or dissolved into aqueous solutions in quantities that can alter the test results. Materials and equipment that contact stock or test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals. Glass, stainless steel, and perfluorocarbon plastic should be used whenever possible. Concrete, fiberglass, or plastic (e.g., PVC) may be used for holding tanks, acclimation tanks, and water supply systems, but they should be used to remove rust particles. Rubber, copper, brass, galvanized metal, epoxy glues, and lead should not come in contact with the dilution water, stock solution, or test solution.
