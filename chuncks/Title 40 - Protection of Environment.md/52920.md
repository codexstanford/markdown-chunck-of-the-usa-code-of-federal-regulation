###### ยง 98.355 Procedures for estimating missing data.
####### e.g.,

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (if a meter malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations, according to the following requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:

(a) For each missing weekly value of COD or BODor wastewater flow entering an anaerobic wastewater treatment process, the substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of those parameters for the week immediately preceding and the week immediately following the missing data incident.

(b) For each missing value of the CHcontent or biogas flow rates, the substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident.

(c) If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value must be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period. If, for a particular parameter, the "after" value is not obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the last quality-assured value obtained "before" the missing data period for the missing data substitution. You must document and keep records of the procedures you use for all such estimates.
