####### ยง 63.2853 How do I determine the actual solvent loss?
######## Gallons of extraction solvent received.

(4)Record the total gallons of extraction solvent received in each shipment. For most processes, the gallons of solvent received represents purchases of delivered solvent added to the solvent storage inventory. However, if your process refines additional vegetable oil from off-site sources, recovers solvent from the off-site oil, and adds it to the on-site solvent inventory, then you must determine the quantity of recovered solvent and include it in the gallons of extraction solvent received.
