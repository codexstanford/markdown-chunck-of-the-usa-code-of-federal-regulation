(b)(1) All measurement equipment shall be calibrated prior to its first use for reporting under this subpart, using an appropriate standard method published by a consensus based standards organization or according to the equipment manufacturer's directions.

(2) Measurement equipment shall be recalibrated at the minimum frequency specified by the standard method used or by the equipment manufacturer's directions.

(3) For units and processes that operate continuously with infrequent outages, it may not be possible to complete the calibration of a flow meter or other measurement device without disrupting normal process operation.

Such postponements shall be documented in the monitoring plan that is required under ยง 98.3(g)(5).
