####### Necessary costs

means "necessary response costs" as required by section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA for Fund reimbursement of a preauthorized response action. Necessary response costs are costs determined to be:

(1) Required (based upon the site-specific circumstances);

(2) Reasonable (nature and amount do not exceed that estimated or which would be incurred by a prudent person);

(3) Allocable (incurred specifically for the site at issue); and

(4) Otherwise allowable (consistent with the limitations and exclusions under the appropriate Federal cost principles). See OMB Circular A-122 (non-profit organizations); OMB Circular A-87 (States and political subdivisions); and 48 CFR part 31, subparts 31.1 and 31.2 (profit-making organizations).
