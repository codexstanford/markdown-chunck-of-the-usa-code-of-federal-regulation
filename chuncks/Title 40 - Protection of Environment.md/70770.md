###### Instrument configuration and calibration.

4.6.6A 2-ml aliquot of the hexane extract prepared by the above procedure is injected into a GC/MS instrument, such as the Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS (recommended for use). This instrument should be equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-Âµm film thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode. Table 9 summarizes the temperature program used for the analysis. This temperature program has been optimized to give the best separation and sensitivity for analysis of the desired compounds on the instrument. Prior to the sample analysis, a five-point calibration must be conducted on a standard mix of the compounds listed in table 7 to determine RRFs for the analyses.
