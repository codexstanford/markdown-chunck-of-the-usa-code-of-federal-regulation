####### Performance test.

(ii)A performance test is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with § 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, and § 65.83(a)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks. The owner or operator is not required to prepare a design evaluation for the control device as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if a performance test will be performed that meets the following criteria:

(A) The performance test demonstrates that the control device achieves greater than or equal to the required control efficiency specified in § 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, or § 65.83(a)(1) for transfer racks; and

(B) The performance test meets the applicable performance test requirements of §§ 65.157 and 65.158, and the results are submitted as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in § 65.165(b).

(iii) If the control device used to comply with § 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, or with § 65.83(a)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks, as applicable, is also used to comply with § 65.63(a)(2) for process vents, or § 65.83(a)(1) for high-throughput transfer racks, a performance test required by § 65.148(b), § 65.149(b), § 65.150(b), § 65.151(b), § 65.152(b), or § 65.155(b) is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with § 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, or § 65.83(a)(1) for low-throughput transfer racks, as applicable. The owner or operator is not required to prepare a design evaluation for the control device as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if a performance test will be performed which meets the following criteria:

(A) The performance test demonstrates that the control device achieves greater than or equal to the required control efficiency specified in § 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, or § 65.83(a)(1) for transfer racks; and

(B) The performance test is submitted as part of the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in § 65.165(b).

(2) A design evaluation or performance test is not required if the owner or operator uses a combustion device meeting the criteria in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section and reports as specified in § 65.165(f).

(i) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts (150 million British thermal units per hour) or greater.

(ii) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator meets either of the following requirements:

(A) The boiler or process heater has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or

(B) The boiler or process heater has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.

(iii) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator meets either of the following requirements:

(A) The incinerator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O; or

(B) The incinerator has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.

(iv) A boiler or process heater into which the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel.
