######## Excessive exceedances notification.

(viii)If you operate the combustor when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point or when the PMDS is malfunctioning more than 5 percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you must submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor, emission control device, or PMDS you are taking to minimize exceedances. To document compliance with this requirement:

(A) You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each alarm and PMDS malfunction, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction and the corrective action taken;

(B) You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds and the PMDS malfunctions;

(C) If inspection of the emission control device demonstrates that no corrective action is required, then no alarm time is counted; and

(D) If corrective action to the emission control device is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. Each PMDS malfunction shall also be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.
