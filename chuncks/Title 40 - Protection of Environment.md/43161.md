####### Multiple Test Potential for Non-Baseline Products.

(i)(1) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a gasoline or diesel product meets criteria for classification as a non-baseline product (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(3)(i)(B) or § 79.56(e)(3)(ii)(B)), then the manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing) of a separate formulation for each reported oxygenating compound, specified class of oxygenating compounds, or other substance which defines a separate non-baseline fuel/additive group pursuant to § 79.56(e)(4)(ii)(A) or (B). For each such substance, testing shall be performed on a mixture of the relevant substance in the appropriate base fuel, formulated according to the specifications for the corresponding group representatives in § 79.56(e)(4)(ii).

(2) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non- baseline gasoline product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses gasoline formulations with less than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing of) a baseline gasoline formulation as well as one or more non-baseline gasoline formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(3) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non- baseline diesel product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses diesel formulations with less than 1.0 weight percent oxygen as well as diesel formulations with 1.0 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing) of a baseline diesel formulation as well as one or more non-baseline diesel formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(4) The presence in a particular oxygenating additive of small amounts of other unintended oxygenate compounds as byproducts of the manufacturing process of the given oxygenating additive does not affect the grouping of that additive and does not create multiple testing responsibilities for manufacturers who blend that additive into fuel.
