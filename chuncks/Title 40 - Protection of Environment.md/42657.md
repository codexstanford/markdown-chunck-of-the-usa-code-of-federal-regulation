###### § 75.34 Units with add-on emission controls.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected unit equipped with add-on SOand/or NOemission controls shall provide substitute data in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1), through (a)(5) of this section for each hour in which quality-assured data from the outlet SOand/or NOmonitoring system(s) are not obtained.

(1) The owner or operator may use the missing data substitution procedures specified in §§ 75.31 through 75.33 to provide substitute data for any missing data hour(s) in which the add-on emission controls are documented to be operating properly, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit, required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall, for each missing data period, record parametric data to verify the proper operation of the SOor NOadd-on emission controls during each hour, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. For any missing data hour(s) in which such parametric data are either not provided or, if provided, do not demonstrate that proper operation of the SOor NOadd-on emission controls has been maintained, the owner or operator shall substitute (as applicable) the maximum potential NOconcentration (MPC) as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential concentration for SO, as defined by section 2.1.1.1. Alternatively, for SOor NO, the owner or operator may substitute, if available, the hourly SOor NOconcentration recorded by a certified inlet monitor, in lieu of the MPC. For each hour in which data from an inlet monitor are reported, the owner or operator shall use a method of determination code (MODC) of "22" (see Table 4a in § 75.57). In addition, under § 75.64(c), the designated representative shall submit as part of each electronic quarterly report, a certification statement, verifying the proper operation of the SOor NOadd-on emission control for each missing data period in which the missing data procedures of §§ 75.31 through 75.33 were applied; or

(2) This paragraph, (a)(2), applies only to a unit which, as provided in § 75.74(a) or § 75.74(b)(1), reports NOmass emissions on a year-round basis under a state or Federal NOmass emissions reduction program that adopts the emissions monitoring provisions of this part. If the add-on NOemission controls installed on such a unit are operated only during the ozone season or are operated in a more efficient manner during the ozone season than outside the ozone season, the owner or operator may implement the missing data provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the following alternative manner:

(i) The historical, quality-assured NOemission rate or NOconcentration data may be separated into two categories, i.e., data recorded inside the ozone season and data recorded outside the ozone season;

(ii) For the purposes of the missing data lookback periods described under §§ 75.33 (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section, the substitute data values shall be taken from the appropriate database, depending on the date(s) and hour(s) of the missing data period. That is, if the missing data period occurs inside the ozone season, the ozone season data shall be used to provide substitute data. If the missing data period occurs outside the ozone season, data from outside the ozone season shall be used to provide substitute data.

(iii) A missing data period that begins outside the ozone season and continues into the ozone season shall be considered to be two separate missing data periods, one ending on April 30, hour 23, and the other beginning on May 1, hour 00;

(iv) For missing data hours outside the ozone season, the procedures of § 75.33 may be applied unconditionally, i.e., documentation of the operational status of the emission controls is not required in order to apply the standard missing data routines.
