###### § 63.455 Reporting requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall comply with the reporting requirements of subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 to subpart S of part 63 and all the following requirements in this section. The initial notification report specified under § 63.9(b)(2) of subpart A of this part shall be submitted by April 15, 1999, or no later than 120 days after the source becomes subject to this subpart, whichever is later.

(b) Each owner or operator of a kraft pulping system specified in § 63.440(d)(1) or a bleaching system specified in § 63.440(d)(3)(ii) shall submit, with the initial notification report specified under § 63.9(b)(2) of subpart A of this part and paragraph (a) of this section and update every two years thereafter, a non-binding control strategy report containing, at a minimum, the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section in addition to the information required in § 63.9(b)(2) of subpart A of this part.

(1) A description of the emission controls or process modifications selected for compliance with the control requirements in this standard.

(2) A compliance schedule, including the dates by which each step toward compliance will be reached for each emission point or sets of emission points. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:

(i) The date by which the major study(s) for determining the compliance strategy will be completed;

(ii) The date by which contracts for emission controls or process modifications will be awarded, or the date by which orders will be issued for the purchase of major components to accomplish emission controls or process changes;

(iii) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be initiated;

(iv) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emissions control equipment, or a process change is to be completed;

(v) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved;

(vi) For compliance with paragraph § 63.440(d)(3)(ii), the tentative dates by which compliance with effluent limitation guidelines and standards intermediate pollutant load effluent reductions and as available, all the dates for the best available technology's milestones reported in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System authorized under section 402 of the Clean Water Act and for the best professional milestones in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program under 40 CFR 430.24 (b)(2); and

(vii) The date by which the final compliance tests will be performed.

(3) Until compliance is achieved, revisions or updates shall be made to the control strategy report required by paragraph (b) of this section indicating the progress made towards completing the installation of the emission controls or process modifications during the 2-year period.

(c) The owner or operator of each bleaching system complying with § 63.440(d)(3)(ii)(B) shall certify in the report specified under § 63.10(e)(3) of subpart A of this part that the daily application rates of chlorine and hypochlorite for that bleaching system have not increased as specified in § 63.440(d)(3)(ii)(B) until the requirements of § 63.440(d)(3)(ii)(A) are met.

(d) The owner or operator shall meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section upon startup of any new affected process equipment or pulping process condensate stream that becomes subject to the standards of this subpart due to a process change or modification.

(e) If the owner or operator uses the results of the performance test required in § 63.453(p)(2) to revise the approved values or ranges of the monitoring parameters specified in § 63.453(j)(1) or (2), the owner or operator shall submit an initial notification of the subsequent performance test to the Administrator as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days, before the performance test required in § 63.453(p)(2) is scheduled to be conducted. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours, before the performance test is scheduled to be conducted to confirm the exact date and time of the performance test.

(f) To comply with the open biological treatment system monitoring provisions of § 63.453(p)(3), the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator as soon as practicable of the onset of the dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions that did not allow a compliance determination to be conducted using the sampling and test procedures in § 63.457(l). The notification shall occur no later than 24 hours after the onset of the dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and shall include the specific reason(s) that the sampling and test procedures in § 63.457(l) could not be performed.
