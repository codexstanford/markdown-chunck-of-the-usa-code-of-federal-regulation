####### Fiber-bed mist eliminator

means an add-on air pollution control device that removes contaminants from a gas stream through the mechanisms of inertial impaction and Brownian diffusion. These devices are typically installed downstream of another control device, which serves to prevent plugging, and consist of one or more fiber beds. Each bed consists of a hollow cylinder formed from two concentric screens; the fiber between the screens may be fabricated from glass, ceramic plastic, or metal.
