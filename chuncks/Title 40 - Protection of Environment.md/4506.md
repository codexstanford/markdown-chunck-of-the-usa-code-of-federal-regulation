###### Zero air.

2.3.3Air, free of contaminants which might react with NO or NOor cause a detectable response on the NO/NO/NOanalyzer. When using permeation devices that are sensitive to moisture, the zero air passing across the permeation device must be dry to avoid surface reactions on the device. (Refer to the supplier's instructions for use of the permeation device.) A procedure for generating zero air is given in reference 13.
