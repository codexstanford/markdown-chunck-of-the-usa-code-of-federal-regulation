(133) On February 24, 2014, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted revisions to its nitrogen oxide (NO) combustion turbine rule for the Milwaukee-Racine former nonattainment area for the 1997 ozone standard. This revision is contained in "2013 Wisconsin Act 91-Senate Bill 371" which allows alternative NOemission requirements for simple cycle combustion turbines, that undergo a modification on or after February 1, 2001, if dry low NOcombustion is not technically or economically feasible. This revision is approvable because it provides for alternative NOrequirements subject to EPA approval on a case-by-case basis and therefore satisfies the reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act).
