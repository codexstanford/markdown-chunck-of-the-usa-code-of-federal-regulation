The partial pressures of individual condensable compounds may be calculated using Raoult's law, the pressure of the vessel vapor space may be set equal to 760 mmHg, and the partial pressure of HAP shall be assumed to be 25 percent of the saturated value if the purge flow rate is greater than 100 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm).
