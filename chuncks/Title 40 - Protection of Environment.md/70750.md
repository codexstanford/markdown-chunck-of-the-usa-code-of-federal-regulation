###### Sampling.

4.4.2The control and treatments (nutrient and product flasks) are sampled three times over a 28-day period: day 0, day 7, and day 28. The entire flask is sacrificed for analysis; a 0.5-ml aliquot is removed from each flask for the microbiological analysis and the remainder of each flask is used for the chemical analysis. Specific procedures for both the microbiological and chemical analysis are described below. At the time of each sampling event, physical observations of each flask should be recorded.
