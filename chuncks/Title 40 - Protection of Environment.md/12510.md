(2)Any owner or operator of a coating line subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section may comply with this paragraph, rather than with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a capture system and control device are operated at all times and the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section (depending upon the source category) through the applicable coating analysis and capture system and control device efficiency test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section; and the control device is equipped with the applicable monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section and the monitoring equipment is installed, calibrated, operated and maintained according to vendor specifications at all times the control device is in use.
