####### Calculated Purge Duration Method:

(i)Each facility must calculate the purge duration of their closed vent system by evaluating the volume of the closed vent system and the flowrate of the contents of the closed vent system from the reactor to the common tail gas header. Additionally, each facility must calculate the amount of time it takes to open and/or close the common tail gas header and open and/or close the main unit filter vent to maintain constant pressure. The time required to completely purge the closed vent system is added to the time required to open and close the associated vents along with a safety factor that accounts for the physical and technological constraints of the facility, to determine the total calculated purge duration in minutes.
