####### Detection instrument calibration gas.

(4)Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and a mixture of methane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million; or a mixture of n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air or n-hexane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or n-hexane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more compounds to be measured in air.
