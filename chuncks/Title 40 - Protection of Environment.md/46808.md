####### Data analysis:

(7)The data recorded during the calibration are to be used in the following calculations:

(i) The air flow rate, Q, at each test point is calculated in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.

(ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test point:

(iii) Plot Kas a function of venturi inlet pressure. For sonic flow Kwill have a relatively constant value. As pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and Kdecreases. See Figure B90-10.

(iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region calculate an average Kand the standard deviation.

(v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average Ktake corrective action.

(8) Calculation of a parameter for monitoring sonic flow in the CFV during exhaust emissions tests:
