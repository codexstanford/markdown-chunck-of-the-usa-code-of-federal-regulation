####### Required testing.

(b)The emission-data engine must be tested as specified in subpart F of this part. Testing engine-out emissions to simulate operation with disabled Tier 3 emission controls must simulate backpressure and other parameters as needed to represent in-use operation with an SCR catalyst. The catalyst material or other aftertreatment device must be tested under conditions that accurately represent actual engine conditions for the test points. This catalyst or aftertreatment testing may be performed on a bench scale.
