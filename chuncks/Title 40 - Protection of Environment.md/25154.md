###### § 63.6 Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
####### Use of a continuous opacity monitoring system.

(7)(i) The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) shall record the monitoring data produced during a performance test required under § 63.7 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(e)(4).

(ii) Whenever an opacity emission test method has not been specified in an applicable subpart, or an owner or operator of an affected source is required to conduct Test Method 9 observations (see appendix A of part 60 of this chapter), the owner or operator may submit, for compliance purposes, COMS data results produced during any performance test required under § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 data. If the owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the opacity emission standard, he or she shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in writing, simultaneously with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the performance test is scheduled to begin. Once the owner or operator of an affected source has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent performance tests required under § 63.7, unless the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing to the contrary not later than with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the subsequent performance test is scheduled to begin.

(iii) For the purposes of determining compliance with the opacity emission standard during a performance test required under § 63.7 using COMS data, the COMS data shall be reduced to 6-minute averages over the duration of the mass emission performance test.

(iv) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS for compliance purposes is responsible for demonstrating that he/she has complied with the performance evaluation requirements of § 63.8(e), that the COMS has been properly maintained, operated, and data quality-assured, as specified in § 63.8(c) and § 63.8(d), and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.

(v) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section, the results of continuous monitoring by a COMS that indicate that the opacity at the time visual observations were made was not in excess of the emission standard are probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an emission, provided that the affected source proves that, at the time of the alleged violation, the instrument used was properly maintained, as specified in § 63.8(c), and met Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of part 60 of this chapter, and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
