(C) If all repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring are-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for triggered source water monitoring is-positive, the system has violated theMCL, but is not required to comply with ยง 141.402(a)(3).

(6) States may review, revise, and approve, as appropriate, repeat sampling proposed by systems under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section. The system must demonstrate that the sample siting plan remains representative of the water quality in the distribution system. The State may determine that monitoring at the entry point to the distribution system (especially for undisinfected ground water systems) is effective to differentiate between potential source water and distribution system problems.
