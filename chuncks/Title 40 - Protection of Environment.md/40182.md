###### Identify Test Requirements.

4.1Identify and record the test requirements described in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum. These values set the desired or required goals of the proposed analysis; the description of methods for determining whether these goals are actually met during the analysis comprises the majority of this Protocol.

4.1.1 Analytes (specific chemical species) of interest. Label the analytes from i = 1 to I.

4.1.2 Analytical uncertainty limit (AU). The AUis the maximum permissible fractional uncertainty of analysis for the ianalyte concentration, expressed as a fraction of the analyte concentration in the sample.

4.1.3 Required detection limit for each analyte (DL, ppm). The detection limit is the lowest concentration of an analyte for which its overall fractional uncertainty (OFU) is required to be less than its analytical uncertainty limit (AU).

4.1.4 Maximum expected concentration of each analyte (CMAX, ppm).
