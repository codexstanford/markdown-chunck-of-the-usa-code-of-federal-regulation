####### Hybrid vehicle

means a vehicle that includes energy storage features (other than a conventional battery system or conventional flywheel) in addition to an internal combustion engine or other engine using consumable chemical fuel. Supplemental electrical batteries and hydraulic accumulators are examples of hybrid energy storage systems. Note other examples of systems that qualify as hybrid engines or powertrains are systems that recover kinetic energy and use it to power an electric heater in the aftertreatment. Note that certain provisions in this part treat hybrid vehicles that include regenerative braking different than those that do not include regenerative braking.
