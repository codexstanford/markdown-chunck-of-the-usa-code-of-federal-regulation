###### ยง 725.15 Determining applicability when microorganism identity or use is confidential or uncertain.
####### Confidential identity or use.

(1)In some cases it may not be possible to directly determine if a specific microorganism is listed, because portions of that entry may contain generic information to protect confidential business information (CBI). If any portion of the microorganism's identity or use has been claimed as CBI, that portion does not appear on the public version of the Inventory, in ยง 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. Instead, it is contained in a confidential version held in EPA's Confidential Business Information Center (CBIC). The public versions contain generic information which masks the confidential business information. A person who intends to conduct an activity involving a microorganism or use whose entry is described with generic information will need to inquire of EPA whether the unreported microorganism or use is on the confidential version.
