###### Monitoring and Compliance Provisions
####### § 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Documentation required.

(iv)(A) The alternative standard petition you submit under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section must include data or information documenting that raw material contributions to emissions prevent you from complying with the emission standard even though the source is using MACT, as defined under paragraphs (b)(9)(viii) and (ix) of this section, for the standard for which you are seeking relief.

(B) Alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section must include data or information documenting that mercury is not present at detectable levels in raw materials.

(v) You must include data or information with semivolatile metal and low volatility metal alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section documenting that increased chlorine feedrates associated with the burning of hazardous waste, when compared to non-hazardous waste operations, do not significantly increase metal emissions attributable to raw materials.

(vi) You must include data or information with semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section documenting that semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emissions attributable to the hazardous waste only will not exceed the emission standards of this subpart.

(vii) You must not operate pursuant to your recommended alternative standards in lieu of emission standards specified in this subpart:

(A) Unless the Administrator approves the provisions of the alternative standard petition request or establishes other alternative standards; and

(B) Until you submit a revised Notification of Compliance that incorporates the revised standards.

(viii) For purposes of this alternative standard provision, MACT for existing hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns is defined as:

(A) For mercury, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 24 µg/dscm or less;

(B) For semivolatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 280,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 57 mg/dscm or less;

(C) For low volatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 120,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 57 mg/dscm or less; and

(D) For hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas, a hazardous waste chlorine feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 2,000,000 µgm/dscm or less, and use of an air pollution control device with a hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas removal efficiency of 85 percent or greater.

(ix) For purposes of this alternative standard provision, MACT for new hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns is defined as:

(A) For mercury, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 4 µg/dscm or less;

(B) For semivolatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 280,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 57 mg/dscm or less;

(C) For low volatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 46,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 57 mg/dscm or less;

(D) For hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas, a hazardous waste chlorine feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 14,000,000 µgm/dscm or less, and use of an air pollution control device with a hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas removal efficiency of 99.6 percent or greater.
