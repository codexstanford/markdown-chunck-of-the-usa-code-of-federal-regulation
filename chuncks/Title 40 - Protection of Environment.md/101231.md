####### Waterline length

means the horizontal distance measured between perpendiculars taken at the forwardmost and aftermost points on the waterline corresponding to the deepest operating draft (see "Length between perpendiculars" at 46 CFR 175.400). This applies for a worst-case combination of a fully loaded vessel in freshwater in summer.
