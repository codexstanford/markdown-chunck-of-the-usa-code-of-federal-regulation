(iv) If the standard deviation of all thevalues exceeds 0.3% of the mean, omit thevalue corresponding to the data point collected at the highestmeasured during calibration.

(v) If the number of remaining data points is less than seven, take corrective action by checking your calibration data or repeating the calibration process. If you repeat the calibration process, we recommend checking for leaks, applying tighter tolerances to measurements and allowing more time for flows to stabilize.
