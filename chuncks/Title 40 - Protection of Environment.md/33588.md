######## Transfer rack

means a single system used to load organic liquids into, or unload organic liquids out of, transport vehicles or containers. It includes all loading and unloading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and equipment necessary for the transfer operation. Transfer equipment and operations that are physically separate (i.e., do not share common piping, valves, and other equipment) are considered to be separate transfer racks.
