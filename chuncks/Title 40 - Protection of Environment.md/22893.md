####### Capital expenditure

means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source which exceeds the product of the applicable "annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage" specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the stationary source's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source must not be reduced by any "excluded additions" as defined for stationary sources constructed after December 31, 1981, in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes. In addition, "annual asset guideline repair allowance" may be used even though it is excluded for tax purposes in IRS Publication 534.
