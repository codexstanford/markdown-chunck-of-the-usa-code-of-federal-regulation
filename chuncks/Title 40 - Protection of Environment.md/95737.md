###### ยง 797.1300 Daphnid acute toxicity test.
####### Care and handling.

(iii)(A) Daphnids should be cultured in dilution water under similar environmental conditions to those used in the test. Organisms should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary it should be done as gently, carefully, and quickly as possible. During culturing and acclimation, daphnids should be observed carefully for ephippia and other signs of stress, physical damage and mortality. Dead and abnormal individuals shall be discarded. Organisms that touch dry surfaces or are dropped or injured in handling shall be discarded.

(B) Smooth glass tubes (I.D. greater than 5 mm) equipped with rubber bulb should be used for transferring daphnids with minimal culture media carry-over. Care should be exercised to introduce the daphnids below the surface of any solution to avoid trapping air under the carapace.
