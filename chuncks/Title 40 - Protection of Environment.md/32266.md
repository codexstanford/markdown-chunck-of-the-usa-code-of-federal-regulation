####### Average batch vent concentration determination using grab samples.

(3)If grab samples are taken to determine the average batch vent concentration of total organic HAP, organic HAP emissions shall be calculated as follows:

(i) For each measurement point, the emission rate shall be calculated using Equation 3 of this section:

(ii) The organic HAP emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equation 4 of this section:
