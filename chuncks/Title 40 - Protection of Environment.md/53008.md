####### Analytical Methods.

(1)Use a quality-assured analytical measurement technology capable of detecting the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest and use a procedure validated with the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest. Where standards for the analyte are not available, a chemically similar surrogate may be used. Acceptable analytical measurement technologies include but are not limited to gas chromatography (GC) with an appropriate detector, infrared (IR), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Acceptable methods include EPA Method 18 in appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60; EPA Method 320 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63; the Protocol for Measuring Destruction or Removal Efficiency (DRE) of Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Abatement Equipment in Electronics Manufacturing, Version 1, EPA-430-R-10-003, (March 2010) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7); ASTM D6348-03 Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Compounds by Extractive Direct Interface Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7); or other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 301 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63 or some other scientifically sound validation protocol. The validation protocol may include analytical technology manufacturer specifications or recommendations.
