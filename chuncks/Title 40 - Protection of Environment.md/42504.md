(3) Install, certify, operate, and maintain SOand flow rate monitoring systems only on the main stack. If this option is chosen, report the following values for each hour during which emissions pass through the bypass stack: the maximum potential concentration of SOas determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part (or, if available, the SOconcentration measured by a certified monitor located at the control device inlet may be reported instead), and the hourly volumetric flow rate value that would be substituted for the flow monitor installed on the main stack or flue under the missing data procedures in subpart D of this part if data from the flow monitor installed on the main stack or flue were missing for the hour. The maximum potential SOconcentration may be specific to the type of fuel combusted in the unit during the bypass (ยง 75.33(b)(5)). The option in this paragraph, (c)(3), may only be used if use of the bypass stack is limited to unit startup, emergency situations (e.g., malfunction of a flue gas desulfurization system), and periods of routine maintenance of the flue gas desulfurization system or maintenance on the main stack. If this option is chosen, it is not necessary to designate the exhaust configuration as a multiple stack configuration in the monitoring plan required under ยง 75.53, with respect to SOor any other parameter that is monitored only at the main stack. Calculate SOmass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions calculated with the substitute values and the emissions recorded by the SOand flow monitoring systems installed on the main stack.
