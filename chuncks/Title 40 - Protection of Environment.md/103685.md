(10) Useto determine CFV flow during an emission test. Do not use the CFV above the highest allowed, as determined in § 1066.625.

(11) Verify the calibration by performing a CVS verification (i.e., propane check) as described in 40 CFR 1065.341.

(12) If your CVS is configured to operate multiple CFVs in parallel, calibrate your CVS using one of the following methods:

(i) Calibrate every combination of CFVs according to this section and § 1066.625(c). Refer to § 1066.630(c) for instructions on calculating flow rates for this option.

(ii) Calibrate each CFV according to this section and § 1066.625. Refer to § 1066.630 for instructions on calculating flow rates for this option.
