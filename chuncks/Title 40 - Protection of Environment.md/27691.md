###### § 63.703 Standards.
####### Wastewater treatment systems.

(g)(1) Except as stipulated by § 63.703(b), each owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart shall:

(i) Treat the wastewater discharge to remove each HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing operations that is present in the wastewater discharge by at least the fraction removed (F) specified in Table 9 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart G; or

(ii) Treat (other than by dilution) the HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing operations that are present in the wastewater discharge such that the exit concentration is less than 50 ppmw of total VOHAP.

(2) The treatment method used to meet the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall not transfer emissions from the water to the atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner.

(h)(1) Magnetic tape manufacturing operations that are subject to § 63.703(b) and are not at major sources are not subject to §§ 63.6(e), 63.6(f), 63.6(g), 63.6(i)(4), 63.7, 63.8, 63.9 (c) through (h), 63.10(b)(2), 63.10(c), 63.10(d) (2) through (5), 63.10(e), and 63.11 of subpart A.

(2) Magnetic tape manufacturing operations subject to § 63.703(b) shall fulfill the recordkeeping requirements of § 63.706(e) and the reporting requirements of § 63.707 (b), (c), and (j).

(3) An owner or operator of a magnetic tape manufacturing operation subject to § 63.703(b) who chooses to no longer be subject to § 63.703(b) shall notify the Administrator or delegated State of such change. If by no longer being subject to § 63.703(b), the source at which the magnetic tape manufacturing operation is located would become a major source, the owner or operator shall meet the following requirements, starting from the date of such notification:

(i) Comply with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, and other provisions of this subpart within the timeframe specified in § 63.6(c)(5); and

(ii) Comply with the HAP utilization limits in § 63.703(b) until the requirements of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section are met.

(i) For any solvent storage tank, piece of mix preparation equipment, waste handling device, condenser vent in solvent recovery, wash sink for cleaning removable parts, and set of equipment for flushing of fixed lines, the owner or operator may, instead of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1), (e)(1)(i), or (f)(1)(i) of this section, vent the gaseous HAP emissions to an add-on air pollution control device other than an incinerator that, in conjunction with capture equipment or ductwork, is designed to achieve an overall HAP control efficiency of at least 95 percent for the emissions from the coating operation, and achieve an alternate outlet concentration limit when coating operations are not occurring, as determined in § 63.704(b)(11)(ii).

(j) The requirements of this subpart do not preclude the use of pressure relief valves and vacuum relief valves for safety purposes.
