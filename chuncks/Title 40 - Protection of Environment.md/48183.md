(a)Manufacturers may optionally generate credits for reductions in their fleet average COemissions achieved in the 2009 through 2011 model years.

The manufacturer may select only one pathway, and that pathway must remain in effect for the 2009 through 2011 model years. Fleet average credits (or debits) must be calculated and reported to EPA for each model year under each selected pathway.
