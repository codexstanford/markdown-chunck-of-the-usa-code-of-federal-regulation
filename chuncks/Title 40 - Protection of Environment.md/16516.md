Report the total costs forecast for administrative, marketing and general corporate overhead functions that directly or indirectly support the smelter's operations. Refer to the NSO Financial Reporting Overview for general discussion of indirect cost allocations from overhead cost pools. Attach as part of Exhibit B a schedule classifying selling, general and administrative expenses into major cost components. Indicate whether each component represents costs directly assignable to the smelter or indirect costs allocated from other business segments to the smelter. Explain the basis used for estimating the amount of expected costs included in each component and the basis used for allocating indirect cost elements to the smelter. Identify and explain any differences between the selling, general and administrative cost classification used in this Schedule and that used in Line 15 of Schedule A.3.
