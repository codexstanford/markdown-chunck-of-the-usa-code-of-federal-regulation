###### § 98.33 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### e.g.,

(5) For units subject to subpart D of this part and for units that use the methods in part 75 of this chapter to quantify COmass emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you may calculate biogenic COemissions from the combustion of biomass fuels listed in Table C-1 of this subpart using Equation C-15a. This equation may not be used to calculate biogenic COemissions from the combustion of tires or MSW; the methods described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must be used for those fuels. Whenever (HI), the annual heat input from combustion of biomass fuel in Equation C-15a, cannot be determined solely from the information in the electronic emissions reports under § 75.64 of this chapter (in cases where a unit uses CEMS in combination with multiple F-factors, a worst-case F-factor, or a prorated F-factor to report heat input rather than reporting heat input based on fuel type), use the best available information (as described in §§ 98.33(c)(4)(ii)(C) and (c)(4)(ii)(D)) to determine (HI).
