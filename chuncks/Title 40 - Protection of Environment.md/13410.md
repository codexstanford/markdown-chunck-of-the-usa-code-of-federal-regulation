####### Maintenance Plan and Transportation Conformity Budgets.

(d)EPA approves the maintenance plan for the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC-MD-VA nonattainment area for the 1997 annual PMNAAQS submitted by the State of Maryland for the entire Area on July 10, 2013 and supplemented on July 26, 2013. The maintenance plan includes motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) to be applied to all future transportation conformity determinations and analyses for the entire Washington, DC-MD-VA PMArea for the 1997 PMNAAQS. The MVEBs are based on a tiered approach: Tier 1 MVEBs are effective as EPA has determined them adequate for transportation conformity purposes; Tier 2 mobile budgets will become effective upon the completion of the interagency consultation process and fully documented within the first conformity analysis that uses the Tier 2 MVEBs.
