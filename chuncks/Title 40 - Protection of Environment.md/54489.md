####### Grandfathering provision.

(j)Applicants that received tentative or final approval for a section 301(h) modified permit prior to February 4, 1987, are not subject to § 125.60, the water quality criteria provisions of § 125.62(a)(1), or § 125.65 until the time of permit renewal. In addition, if permit renewal will occur prior to August 9, 1996, applicants may have additional time to come into compliance with §§ 125.60 and 125.65, as determined appropriate by EPA on a case-by-case basis. Such additional time, however, shall not extend beyond August 9, 1996. This paragraph does not apply to any application that was initially tentatively approved, but as to which EPA withdrew its tentative approval or issued a tentative denial prior to February 4, 1987.
