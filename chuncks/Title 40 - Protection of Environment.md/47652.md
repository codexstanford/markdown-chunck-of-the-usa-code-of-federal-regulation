####### Performance of OBD functions.

(7)Any sensor or other component deterioration or malfunction which renders that sensor or component incapable of performing its function as part of the OBD system must be detected and identified on engines so equipped.

(o) For 2007 and later model year diesel complete heavy-duty vehicles, in lieu of the certification provisions of paragraph (k) of this section, the certification provisions of this paragraph (o) shall apply. For test groups required to have an OBD system, certification will not be granted if, for any test vehicle approved by the Administrator in consultation with the manufacturer, the malfunction indicator light does not illuminate under any of the following circumstances, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that any identified OBD problems discovered during the Administrator's evaluation will be corrected on production vehicles.

(1)(i) If monitored for emissions performance-a reduction catalyst is replaced with a deteriorated or defective catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding, for 2007 through 2009 model years, 4 times the applicable NOstandard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, the applicable NOstandard + 0.6 g/mi and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi. Also if monitored for emissions performance-an oxidation catalyst (not to include the DPF) is replaced with a deteriorated or defective catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust NMHC emissions exceeding, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard and, for 2013 and later model years, 2 times the applicable NMHC standard. If monitored for exotherm performance for 2010 and later model years, an oxidation catalsyt is replaced with a deteriorated or defective catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in an inability to achieve a 100 degree C temperature rise, or the necessary regeneration temperature, within 60 seconds of initiating a DPF regeneration.

(ii) If monitored for performance-a DPF is replaced with a DPF that has catastrophically failed, or an electronic simulation of such. Further, a DPF is replaced with a deteriorated or defective DPF, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust PM emissions exceeding, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.04 g/mi.

(2) An engine misfire condition is induced and is not detected.

(3)(i) If so equipped, any oxygen sensor or air-fuel ratio sensor located downstream of aftertreatment devices is replaced with a deteriorated or defective sensor, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding any of the following levels: for 2007 through 2009 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or 3 times the applicable NOstandard, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.04 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2 times the applicable NMHC standard.

(ii) If so equipped, any oxygen sensor or air-fuel ratio sensor located upstream of aftertreatment devices is replaced with a deteriorated or defective sensor, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding any of the following levels: for 2007 through 2009 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or 3 times the applicable NOstandard, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.02 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.02 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2 times the applicable CO standard.

(iii) If so equipped, any NOsensor is replaced with a deteriorated or defective sensor, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding any of the following levels: for 2007 through 2009 model years, 5 times the applicable PM standard, or 4 times the applicable NOstandard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.6 g/mi and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.04 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi.

(4) [Reserved]

(5) A malfunction condition is induced in any emission-related engine system or component, including but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding any of the following levels: for 2007 through 2009 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard or 3 times the applicable NOstandard, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2010 through 2012 model years, 4 times the applicable PM standard, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2.5 times the applicable CO standard and, for 2013 and later model years, the applicable PM standard + 0.02 g/mi, or the applicable NOstandard + 0.3 g/mi, or 2 times the applicable NMHC standard, or 2 times the applicable CO standard.

(6) A malfunction condition is induced in an electronic emission-related powertrain system or component not otherwise described in this paragraph (o) that either provides input to or receives commands from the on-board computer resulting in a measurable impact on emissions.
