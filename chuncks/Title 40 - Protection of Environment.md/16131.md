####### Engineering and maintenance techniques.

(b)The use of engineering and maintenance techniques to detect and prevent leaks and capture and vent fugitive emissions through appropriate stacks. These techniques include but are not limited to:

(1) For reactors, installation and proper operation of primary hoods;

(2) For roasters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all hot calcine transfer points;

(3) For furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active matte tap holes, matte launders, slag skim bays, and transfer points;

(4) For converters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods for blowing operations, and where appropriate, secondary hoods for charging and pouring operations;

(5) For sintering machines, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on the sinter bed, all hot sinter ignition points, all concentrate laydown points, and all hot sinter transfer points;

(6) For blast furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active slag and lead bullion furnace tap holes and transfer points;

(7) For dross reverberatory furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active charging and discharging points;

(8) Maintenance of all ducts, flues and stacks in a leak-free condition to the maximum extent possible;

(9) Maintenance of all process equipment under normal operating conditions in such a fashion that out-leakage of fugitive gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible;

(10) Secondary or tertiary hooding on process equipment where necessary; and

(11) Partial or complete building evacuation as appropriate.
