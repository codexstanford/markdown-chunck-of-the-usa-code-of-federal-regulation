(6) Record this value as the initial HC concentration,, and use it to correct measured values as described in § 1065.660.

(7) If the initial HC concentration exceeds the greater of the following values, determine the source of the contamination and take corrective action, such as purging the system or replacing contaminated portions:

(i) 2% of the flow-weighted mean concentration expected at the standard or measured during testing.

(ii) 2 µmol/mol.

(8) If corrective action does not resolve the deficiency, you may use a contaminated HC system if it does not prevent you from demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission standards.
