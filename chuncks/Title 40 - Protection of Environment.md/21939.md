###### e.g.,

8.1 Pre-test Procedures. Perform all pre-test procedures (system performance checks, leak checks) necessary to determine gas volume flow rate and organic carbon concentration in the vapor line to the incinerator inlet and to determine organic carbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide concentrations at the incinerator exhaust, as outlined in Method 2A, Method 10, and Method 25A and/or Method 25B as applicable.

8.2 Sampling. At the beginning of the test period, record the initial parameters for the inlet volume meter according to the procedures in Method 2A and mark all of the recorder strip charts to indicate the start of the test. Conduct sampling and analysis as outlined in Method 2A, Method 10, and Method 25A and/or Method 25B as applicable. Continue recording inlet organic and exhaust CO, CO, and organic concentrations throughout the test. During periods of process interruption and halting of gas flow, stop the timer and mark the recorder strip charts so that data from this interruption are not included in the calculations. At the end of the test period, record the final parameters for the inlet volume meter and mark the end on all of the recorder strip charts.
