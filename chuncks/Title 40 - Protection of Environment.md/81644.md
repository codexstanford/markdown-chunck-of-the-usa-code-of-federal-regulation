####### Release to water.

(iv)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 5 ppb). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง 721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substance will be treated before release, then the amount of the substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 75 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment. In addition, when the substance is released in combination with the substances hexanedioic acid, diethenyl ester, hexanoic acid, 2-ethyl-, ethenyl ester, and propanoic acid, 2,2-dimethyl-, ethenyl ester, the quotient from the formula referenced in this section shall not exceed the average of the quotient applicable to the other substances weighted by the proportion of each substance present in the total daily amount released.
