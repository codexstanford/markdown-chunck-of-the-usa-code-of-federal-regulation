###### ยง 1042.305 Preparing and testing production-line engines.
####### Stabilizing emission levels.

(e)You may stabilize emission levels (or establish a Green Engine Factor for Category 2 engines) before you test production-line engines, as follows:

(1) You may stabilize emission levels by operating the engine in a way that represents the way production engines will be used, using good engineering judgment, for no more than the greater of two periods:

(i) 300 hours.

(ii) The number of hours you operated your emission-data engine for certifying the engine family (see 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, or the applicable regulations governing how you should prepare your test engine).

(2) For Category 2 or Category 3 engines, you may ask us to approve a Green Engine Factor for each regulated pollutant for each engine family. Use the Green Engine Factor to adjust measured emission levels to establish a stabilized low-hour emission level.
