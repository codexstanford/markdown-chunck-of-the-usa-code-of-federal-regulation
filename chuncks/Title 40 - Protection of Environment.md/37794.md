####### ยง 63.9322 How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
######## Measuring capture efficiency.

(b)If the capture system does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the two protocols described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocol in paragraph (c) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours in duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a single engine test to go from the beginning to the end.
