####### General test provisions.

(a)The following provisions apply broadly for testing under this section:

(1) Measure NOemissions as described in paragraph (k) of this section. Include these measured NOvalues any time you report to us your greenhouse gas emissions or fuel consumption values from testing under this section.

(2) The procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 apply for testing in this section except as specified. This section uses engine parameters and variables that are consistent with 40 CFR part 1065.

(3) Powertrain testing depends on models to calculate certain parameters. You can use the detailed equations in this section to create your own models, or use the GEM HIL model contained within GEM Phase 2, Version 4.0 (incorporated by reference in ยง 1037.810) to simulate vehicle hardware elements as follows:
