(a)(1) Except for a gasoline manufacturer that has an approved in-line blending waiver under § 1090.1315 that covers all gasoline produced at their facility, a gasoline manufacturer that elects to account for oxygenate added downstream under § 1090.710 must participate in the national sampling and testing oversight program (NSTOP) in this section.
