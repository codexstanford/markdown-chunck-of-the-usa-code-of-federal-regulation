######## Continuous emission monitoring system,CEMS

ormeans the equipment required under subpart HHH of this part to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes (using an automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS)), a permanent record of sulfur dioxide emissions, stack gas volumetric flow rate, stack gas moisture content, and oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration (as applicable), in a manner consistent with part 75 of this chapter. The following systems are the principal types of continuous emission monitoring systems required under subpart HHH of this part:

(1) A flow monitoring system, consisting of a stack flow rate monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic feet per hour (scfh);

(2) A sulfur dioxide monitoring system, consisting of a SOpollutant concentration monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of SOemissions, in parts per million (ppm);

(3) A moisture monitoring system, as defined in ยง 75.11(b)(2) of this chapter and providing a permanent, continuous record of the stack gas moisture content, in percent HO;

(4) A carbon dioxide monitoring system, consisting of a COpollutant concentration monitor (or an oxygen monitor plus suitable mathematical equations from which the COconcentration is derived) and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of COemissions, in percent CO; and

(5) An oxygen monitoring system, consisting of an Oconcentration monitor and an automated data acquisition and handling system and providing a permanent, continuous record of Oin percent O.
