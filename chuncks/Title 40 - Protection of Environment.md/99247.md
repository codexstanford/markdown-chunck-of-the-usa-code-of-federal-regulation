####### Alternate

(j)NO+ HC standards for Tier 4. Manufacturers/remanufacturers may use credits accumulated through the ABT program to certify Tier 4 locomotives to an alternate NO+ HC emission standard of 1.4 g/bhp-hr (instead of the otherwise applicable NOand NMHC standards). You may use NOcredits to show compliance with this standard by certifying your family to a NO+ HC FEL. Calculate the NOcredits needed as specified in subpart H of this part using the NO+ HC emission standard and FEL in the calculation instead of the otherwise applicable NOstandard and FEL. You may not generate credits relative to the alternate standard or certify to the standard without using credits.
