(c)(i) A 3-month parameter mean is considered valid (, meets data completeness requirements) if the average of the data capture rate of the three constituent monthly means (, the 3-month data capture rate) is greater than or equal to 75 percent. Monthly data capture rates (expressed as a percentage) are specifically calculated as the number of creditable samples for the month (including any make-up samples taken the subsequent month for missed samples in the month in question, and excluding any make-up samples taken in the month in question for missed samples in the previous month) divided by the number of scheduled samples for the month, the result then multiplied by 100 but not rounded. The 3-month data capture rate is the sum of the three corresponding unrounded monthly data capture rates divided by three and the result rounded to the nearest integer (zero decimal places). As noted in section 3(c), Pb-TSP and Pb-PMdaily values are processed separately when calculating monthly means and data capture rates; a Pb-TSP value cannot be used as a make-up for a missing Pb-PMvalue or vice versa. For purposes of assessing data capture, Pb-TSP and Pb-PMdata collected before January 1, 2009 will be treated with an assumed scheduled sampling frequency of every sixth day.
