####### Primer, topcoat, and specialty coating application operations.

(c)Each owner or operator of a primer or topcoat application operation subject to this subpart shall submit the following information:

(1) Semiannual reports occurring every 6 months from the date of the notification of compliance status that identify:

(i) For primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings where compliance is not being achieved through the use of averaging or a control device, the HAP or VOC content in manufacturer's supplied data as recorded under § 63.752(c), or each value of Hand G, as recorded under § 63.752(c)(2)(i), that exceeds the applicable organic HAP or VOC content limit specified in § 63.745(c);

(ii) For primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings where compliance is being achieved through the use of averaging, each value of Hand G, as recorded under § 63.752(c)(4)(i), that exceeds the applicable organic HAP or VOC content limit specified in § 63.745(c);

(iii) If incinerators are used to comply with the standards, all periods when the 3-hour average combustion temperature(s) is (are) less than the average combustion temperature(s) established under § 63.751(b) (11) or (12) during the most recent performance test during which compliance was demonstrated;

(iv) If a carbon adsorber is used;

(A) each rolling period when the overall control efficiency of the control system is calculated to be less than 81%, the initial material balance calculation, and any exceedances as demonstrated through the calculation; or,

(B) for nonregenerative carbon adsorbers, submit the design evaluation, the continuous monitoring system performance report, and any excess emissions as demonstrated through deviations of monitored values.

(v) For control devices other than an incinerator or carbon adsorber, each exceedance of the operating parameter(s) established for the control device under the initial performance test during which compliance was demonstrated;

(vi) All times when a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across a dry particulate filter or HEPA filter system, the water flow rate through a conventional waterwash system, or the recommended parameter(s) that indicate the booth performance for pumpless systems, as appropriate, was outside the limit(s) specified by the filter or booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures;

(vii) If the operations have been in compliance for the semiannual period, a statement that the operations have been in compliance with the applicable standards; and,

(2) Annual reports beginning 12 months after the date of the notification of compliance status listing the number of times the pressure drop or water flow rate for each dry filter or waterwash system, as applicable, was outside the limit(s) specified by the filter or booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures.
