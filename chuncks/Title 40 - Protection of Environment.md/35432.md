######## i.e,

(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (conversion efficiency) following the recommended procedures from the manufacturer, the catalyst supplier, or the catalyst test provider.

(ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.

(iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to ยง 63.4766.
