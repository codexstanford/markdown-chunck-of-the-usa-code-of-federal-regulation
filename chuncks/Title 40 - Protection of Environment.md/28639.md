####### Performance level

means the level at which the regulated material in the gases or vapors vented to a control or recovery device is removed, recovered, or destroyed. Examples of control device performance levels include: achieving a minimum organic reduction efficiency expressed as a percentage of regulated material removed or destroyed in the control device inlet stream on a weight-basis; achieving an organic concentration in the control device exhaust stream that is less than a maximum allowable limit expressed in parts per million by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen if a combustion device is the control device and supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions; or maintaining appropriate control device operating parameters indicative of the device performance at specified values.
