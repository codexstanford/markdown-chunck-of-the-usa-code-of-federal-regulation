####### e.g.,

(2) Perform all flow meter calibration at measurement points that are representative of the normal operating range of the meter. Except for the orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, calculate the calibration error at each measurement point using Equation A-2 of this section. The terms "R" and "A" in Equation A-2 must be expressed in consistent units of measure (gallons/minute, ft/min). The calibration error at each measurement point shall not exceed 5.0 percent of the reference value.

(3) For orifice, nozzle, and venturi flow meters, the initial quality assurance consists of in-situ calibration of the differential pressure (delta-P), total pressure, and temperature transmitters.
