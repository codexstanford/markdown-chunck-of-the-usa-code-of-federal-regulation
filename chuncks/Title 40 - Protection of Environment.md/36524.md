####### 7.1.1 Up-Scale CO Calibration Gas Concentration.

Choose one or more up-scale gas concentrations such that the average of the stack gas measurements for each stack gas sampling run are between 25 and 150 percent of those concentrations. Alternatively, choose an up-scale gas that does not exceed twice the concentration of the applicable outlet standard. If a measured gas value exceeds 150 percent of the up-scale CO calibration gas value at any time during the stack gas sampling run, the run must be discarded and repeated.

Select an Ogas concentration such that the difference between the gas concentration and the average stack gas measurement or reading for each sample run is less than 15 percent O. When the average exhaust gas Oreadings are above 6 percent, you may use dry ambient air (20.9 percent O) for the up-scale Ocalibration gas.
