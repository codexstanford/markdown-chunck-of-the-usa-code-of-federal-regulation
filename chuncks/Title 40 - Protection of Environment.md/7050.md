- Be sufficient to show compliance or noncompliance (, through monitoring times of operation, fuel input, or other indices of operating conditions and practices); and

- Specify a reasonable averaging time consistent with established reference methods, contain reference methods for determining compliance, and provide for adequate reporting and recordkeeping so that air quality agency personnel can determine the compliance status of the source; and

- For EGUS, specify an averaging time of a 30-day rolling average, and contain a definition of "boiler operating day" that is consistent with the definition in the proposed revisions to the NSPS for utility boilers in 40 CFR Part 60, subpart Da.You should consider a boiler operating day to be any 24-hour period between 12:00 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time at the steam generating unit. This would allow 30-day rolling average emission rates to be calculated consistently across sources.
