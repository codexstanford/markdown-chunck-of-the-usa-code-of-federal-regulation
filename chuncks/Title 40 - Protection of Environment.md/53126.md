####### Design capacity,design capacity

means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept. For the purposes of this subpart, for landfills that have a permit, thecan be determined in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the state, local, or Tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass to determine its design capacity, the calculation must include a site-specific density. If the design capacity is within 10 percent of the applicability threshold in ยง 98.460(a) and there is a change in the production process that can reasonably be expected to change the site-specific waste density, the site-specific waste density must be redetermined and the design capacity must be recalculated based on the new waste density.
