(e)You may temporarily import nonconforming engines/equipment if you represent a foreign government in a diplomatic or military capacity. U.S Customs and Border Protection may require that you show your written confirmation from the U.S. State Department that you qualify for the diplomatic or military exemption or a copy of your orders for military duty in the United States.
