####### Halogenated vent stream determination.

(c)In order to determine whether a vent stream is halogenated, the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in organic compounds shall be calculated as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The vent stream concentration of each organic compound containing halogen atoms (parts per million by volume by compound) shall be determined based on any of the following procedures:

(i) Process knowledge that no halogen or hydrogen halides are present in the vent stream; or

(ii) Applicable engineering assessment as specified in paragraph (b) of this section; or

(iii) Concentration of organic compounds containing halogens measured by Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; or

(iv) Any other method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63.

(2) Equation 85-1 of this section shall be used to calculate the mass emission rate of halogen atoms:
