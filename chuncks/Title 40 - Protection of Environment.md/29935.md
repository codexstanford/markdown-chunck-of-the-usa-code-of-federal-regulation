(iv)If the AWFCO system fails to automatically and immediately cutoff the flow of hazardous waste upon exceedance of a parameter required to be interlocked with the AWFCO system under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you have failed to comply with the AWFCO requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
