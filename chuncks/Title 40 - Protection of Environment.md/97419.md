####### Results,Kp.

(6)-(i)The Kp must be calculated by dividing the steady-state rate of absorption (measured in micrograms (µg) x hrx centimeters (cm)) by the concentration of the test substance (measured in µg x cm) applied to the skin. (For example, if the steady-state rate is 1 microgram x hrx cmand the concentration applied to the skin is 1,000 micrograms x cm, then the Kp value is calculated to be 0.001 cm x hr.) The mean and standard deviation of the calculated Kp values for all diffusion cell experiments must be determined.
