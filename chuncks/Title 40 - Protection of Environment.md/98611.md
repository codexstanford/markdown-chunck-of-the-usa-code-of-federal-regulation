####### Scope.,in vitro

(a)This section is intended to meet the testing requirements under section 4 of TSCA. Themammalian cell gene mutation test can be used to detect gene mutations induced by chemical substances. Suitable cell lines include L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, the CHO, AS52 and V79 lines of Chinese hamster cells, and TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. In these cell lines the most commonly-used genetic endpoints measure mutation at thymidine kinase (TK) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), and a transgene of xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (XPRT). The TK, HPRT and XPRT mutation tests detect different spectra of genetic events. The autosomal location of TK and XPRT may allow the detection of genetic events (e.g. large deletions) not detected at the HPRT locus on X-chromosomes (For a discussion see the references in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4),(g)(5), and (g)(6) of this section).
