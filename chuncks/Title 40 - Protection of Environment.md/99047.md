####### Immunoglobulin quantification.

(ii)As an alternative to a PFC assay, the effects of the test substance on the antibody response to antigen may be determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Comparison between the PFC and ELISA assays for immunotoxicity assessment are discussed in the references under paragraphs (j)(5), (j)(6), and (j)(10) of this section. Test animals shall be immunized with SRBCs as for the PFC assay. IgM titers in the serum of each test animal shall be determined (usually 4 days after immunization). As with the PFC assay, the optimum dose of SRBCs and optimum time for collection of the sera shall be determined for the species and strain of animal to be tested. Several methods are described in the reference under paragraph (j)(11) of this section).
