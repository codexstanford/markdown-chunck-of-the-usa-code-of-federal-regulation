###### Contents of petition for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period.

(d)The designated representative of an affected unit that has met the minimum criteria under paragraph (a) of this section and that has been operated for a period of at least 3 months following the installation of the required NOemission control system may submit to the permitting authority a petition for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period. In the petition, the designated representative shall provide the following information in a format prescribed by the Administrator:

(1) Identification of the unit;

(2) The type of NOcontrol technology installed (e.g., low NOburner technology, selective noncatalytic reduction, selective catalytic reduction, reburning);

(3) If an alternative technology is installed, the time period (not less than 6 consecutive months) prior to installation of the technology to be used for the demonstration required in paragraph (e)(11) of this section.

(4) Documentation as set forth in § 76.14(a)(1) showing that the installed NOemission control system has been designed to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 and that the system has been properly installed according to procedures and specifications designed to minimize the emissions of NOto the atmosphere;

(5) The date the unit commenced operation following the installation of the NOemission control system or the date the specific unit became subject to the emission limitations of § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, whichever is later;

(6) The dates of the operating period (which must be at least 3 months long);

(7) Certification by the designated representative that the owner(s) or operator operated the unit and the NOemission control system during the operating period in accordance with: Specifications and procedures designed to achieve the maximum NOreduction possible with the installed NOemission control system or the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7; the operating conditions upon which the design of the NOemission control system was based; and vendor specifications and procedures;

(8) A brief statement describing the reason or reasons why the unit cannot achieve the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7;

(9) A demonstration period plan, as set forth in § 76.14(a)(2);

(10) Unit operating data and quality-assured continuous emission monitoring data (including the specific data items listed in § 76.14(a)(3) collected in accordance with part 75 of this chapter during the operating period) and demonstrating the inability of the specific unit to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 on an annual average basis while operating as certified under paragraph (d)(7) of this section;

(11) An interim alternative emission limitation, in lb/mmBtu, that the unit can achieve during a demonstration period of at least 15 months. The interim alternative emission limitation shall be derived from the data specified in paragraph (d)(10) of this section using methods and procedures satisfactory to the Administrator;

(12) The proposed dates of the demonstration period (which must be at least 15 months long);

(13) A report which outlines the testing and procedures to be taken during the demonstration period in order to determine the maximum NOemission reduction obtainable with the installed system. The report shall include the reasons for the NOemission control system's failure to meet the applicable emission limitation, and the tests and procedures that will be followed to optimize the NOemission control system's performance. Such tests and procedures may include those identified in § 76.15 as appropriate.

(14) The special provisions at paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
