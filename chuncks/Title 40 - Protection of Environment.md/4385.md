7.4

7.4.1 The sampler shall incorporate a flow rate measurement device capable of indicating the total sampler flow rate. Two common types of flow indicators covered in the calibration procedure are (1) an electronic mass flowmeter and (2) an orifice or orifices located in the sample air stream together with a suitable pressure indicator such as a manometer, or aneroid pressure gauge. A pressure recorder may be used with an orifice to provide a continuous record of the flow. Other types of flow indicators (including rotameters) having comparable precision and accuracy are also acceptable.

7.4.2 &#x2020; The flow rate measurement device must be capable of being calibrated and read in units corresponding to a flow rate which is readable to the nearest 0.02 std m/min over the range 1.0 to 1.8 std m/min.
