####### Alternative opacity limit.

(i)An alternative opacity limit may be established in place of the opacity limit in paragraph (h) of this section using the following procedures:

(1) If the regulatory authority finds that a potline is in compliance with the applicable TF standard for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with the methods and procedures in ยง 63.849 but during the time such performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, the regulatory authority shall notify and advise the owner or operator that he/she may petition the regulatory authority within 10 days of receipt of notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard.

(2) The regulatory authority will grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the regulatory authority; and that the potroom group and associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.

(3) As indicated by the performance and opacity tests, the regulatory authority will establish an opacity standard for any potroom group meeting the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section such that the opacity standard could be met by the potroom group at all times during which the potline is meeting the TF emission limit.

(4) The alternative opacity limit established in paragraph (i)(3) of this section shall not be greater than 20 percent opacity.
