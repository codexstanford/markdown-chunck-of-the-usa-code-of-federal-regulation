####### The SCS operational manual.

(e)Each NSO shall require the smelter to be operated in accordance with the provisions of an SCS operational manual approved by the issuing agency. The SCS operational manual shall describe the circumstances under which, the extent to which, and the procedures through which emissions shall be curtailed to prevent violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. Failure to curtail emissions when and as much as indicated by the manual or to follow the provisions of the manual implementing the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall constitute a violation of the NSO.

(1) The operational manual shall prescribe emission curtailment decisions based on the use of real time information from the air quality monitoring network dispersion model estimates of the effect of emissions on air quality, and meteorological observations and predictions.

(2) The operational manual shall also provide for emission curtailment to prevent violation of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA which may be caused in part by stack emissions, and to the extent practicable fugitive emissions, from any other source (unless that other source is a smelter subject to an NSO).

(3) The SCS operational manual shall include (but not be limited to):

(i) A clear delineation of the authority of the SCS operator to require all other smelter personnel to implement the operator's curtailment decisions;

(ii) The maintenance and calibration procedures and schedules for all SCS equipment;

(iii) A description of the procedures to be followed for the regular acquisition of all meteorological information necessary to operate the system;

(iv) The ambient concentrations and meteorological conditions that will be used as criteria for determining the need for various degrees of emission curtailment;

(v) The meteorological variables as to which judgments may be made in applying the criteria stated pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section;

(vi) The procedures through which and the maximum time period within which a curtailment decision will be made and implemented by the SCS operator;

(vii) The method for immediately evaluating the adequacy of a particular curtailment decision, including the factors to be considered in that evaluation;

(viii) The procedures through which and the time within which additional necessary curtailment will immediately be effected; and

(ix) The procedures to be followed to protect the NAAQS in the event of a mechanical failure in any element of the SCS.
