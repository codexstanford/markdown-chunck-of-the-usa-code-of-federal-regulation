###### Resident individual.

5.1.1.3.1Evaluate this factor based on whether there is a resident individual, as specified in section 5.1.1.3, who is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations.

First, determine those areas of observed contamination subject to Level I concentrations and those subject to Level II concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-3 in determining the level of contamination. Then assign a value to the resident individual factor as follows:

- Assign a value of 50 if there is at least one resident individual for one or more areas subject to Level I concentrations.

- Assign a value of 45 if there is no such resident individuals, but there is at least one resident individual for one or more areas subject to Level II concentrations.

- Assign a value of 0 if there is no resident individual.
