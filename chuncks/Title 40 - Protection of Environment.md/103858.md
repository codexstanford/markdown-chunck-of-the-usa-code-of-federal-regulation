(2) During exhaust emission tests, monitor sonic flow in the CFV by monitoringBased on the calibration data selected to meet the standard deviation criterion in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (vii) of this section, in whichis constant, select the data values associated with the calibration point with the lowest absolute venturi inlet pressure to determine thelimit. Calculateduring the exhaust emission test using Eq. 1066.625-8 to demonstrate that the value ofduring all emission tests is less than or equal to thelimit derived from the CFV calibration data.
