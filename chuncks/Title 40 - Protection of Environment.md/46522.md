() For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with ยง 86.085-22(e)(1), the emission-data engine presented to the Administrator for testing shall be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer's specifications to be shown on the engine label (see ยง 86.091-35(a)(3)(iii)) as specified in the application for certification. If the Administrator determines that an engine is not within such tolerances, the engine shall be adjusted at the facility designated by the Administrator prior to the test and an engineering report shall be submitted to the Administrator describing the corrective action taken.
