####### § 63.4152 How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?

(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance, for the compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate determined according to § 63.4151(a) through (g) must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. Each month following the initial compliance period described in § 63.4150 is a compliance period.

(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, this is a deviation from the emission limitations for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(e).

(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.4120, if there were no deviations from the emission limitations, you must submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because, during the compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090.

(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131.
