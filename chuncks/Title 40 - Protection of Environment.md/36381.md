######## Startup

begins at the first firing of fuel in the stationary combustion turbine. For simple cycle turbines, startup ends when the stationary combustion turbine has reached stable operation or after 1 hour, whichever is less. For combined cycle turbines, startup ends when the stationary combustion turbine has reached stable operation or after 3 hours, whichever is less. Turbines in combined cycle configurations that are operating as simple cycle turbines must meet the startup requirements for simple cycle turbines while operating as simple cycle turbines.
