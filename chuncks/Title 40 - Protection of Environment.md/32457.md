###### ยง 63.1426 Process vent requirements for determining organic HAP concentration, control efficiency, and aggregated organic HAP emission reduction for a PMPU.
####### Exemptions.

(1)The owner or operator is not required to determine uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for process vents in a PMPU if the conditions in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are met.

(i) For PMPUs where all process vents subject to the epoxide emission reduction requirements of ยง 63.1425(b) are controlled at all times using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device, or extended cookout, the owner or operator is not required to determine uncontrolled epoxide emissions.

(ii) For PMPUs where the combination of process vents from batch unit operations associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product is subject to the Group 1 requirements of ยง 63.1425(c)(1), the owner or operator is not required to determine uncontrolled nonepoxide organic HAP emissions for those process vents if every process vent from a batch unit operation associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product in the PMPU is controlled at all times using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device.

(iii) For PMPUs where all process vents associated with catalyst extraction that are subject to the organic emission reduction requirements of ยง 63.1425(d)(2) are controlled at all times using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator is not required to determine uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for those process vents.
