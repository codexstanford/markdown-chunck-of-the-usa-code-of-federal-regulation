##### Subpart I - Definitions and Other Reference Information
###### § 1054.801 What definitions apply to this part?
####### Useful life

means the period during which the engine and equipment are designed to properly function in terms of power output and intended function, without being remanufactured, specified as a number of hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. It is the period during which a nonroad engine is required to comply with all applicable emission standards. See, for example, §§ 1054.107, 1054.110, and 1054.112. If an engine has no hour meter, the specified number of hours does not limit the period during which an in-use engine is required to comply with emission standards unless the degree of service accumulation can be verified separately.
