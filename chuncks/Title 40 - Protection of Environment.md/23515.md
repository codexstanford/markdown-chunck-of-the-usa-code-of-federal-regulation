###### ยง 61.345 Standards: Containers.
####### e.g.,

(C) For a container cover, the cover and all openings (doors, hatches) must be designed to operate with no detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppmv above background, initially and thereafter at least once per year by the methods specified in ยง 61.355(h).

(iii) Safety devices, as defined in this subpart, may be installed and operated as necessary on any container, enclosure, closed-vent system, or control device used to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) If the cover and closed-vent system operate such that the container is maintained at a pressure less than atmospheric pressure, the owner or operator may operate the system with an opening that is not sealed and kept closed at all times if the following conditions are met:

(i) The purpose of the opening is to provide dilution air to reduce the explosion hazard;

(ii) The opening is designed to operate with no detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppmv above background, as determined initially and thereafter at least once per year by methods specified in ยง 61.355(h); and

(iii) The pressure is monitored continuously to ensure that the pressure in the container remains below atmospheric pressure.

(b) Each cover and all openings shall be visually inspected initially and quarterly thereafter to ensure that they are closed and gasketed properly.

(c) Except as provided in ยง 61.350 of this subpart, when a broken seal or gasket or other problem is identified, first efforts at repair shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after identification.
