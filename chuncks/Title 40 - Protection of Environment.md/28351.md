####### Paste production plants.

(b)The owner or operator shall install, operate and maintain equipment to capture and control POM and PM emissions from each paste production plant.

(1) The emission capture system shall be installed and operated to meet the generally accepted engineering standards for minimum exhaust rates as published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in Chapters 3 and 5 of "Industrial Ventilation: A Handbook of Recommended Practice" (incorporated by reference; see ยง 63.14); and

(2) Captured emissions shall be routed through a closed system to a dry coke scrubber; or

(3) The owner or operator may submit a written request for use of an alternative control device to the applicable regulatory authority for review and approval. The request shall contain information and data demonstrating that the alternative control device achieves POM emissions less than 0.011 lb/ton of paste for plants with continuous mixers or POM emissions less than 0.024 lb/ton of paste for plants with batch mixers. The POM emission rate shall be determined by sampling using Method 315 in appendix A to this part.
