####### MIL-on DTCs.

(B)If a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the OBD system must immediately store a MIL-on DTC if the percentage of misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is again exceeded one or more times during either the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC, regardless of the conditions encountered during that drive cycle, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored. If, during a previous drive cycle, a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a MIL-on DTC must be stored immediately upon exceeding the percentage misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section regardless of the conditions encountered. Upon storage of a MIL-on DTC, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated until the conditions are met for extinguishing the MIL.
