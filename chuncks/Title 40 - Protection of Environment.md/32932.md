######## Cyclic regeneration reforming

means a catalytic reforming process characterized by continual batch regeneration of catalyst in situ in any one of several reactors (e.g., 4 or 5 separate reactors) that can be isolated from and returned to the reforming operation while maintaining continuous reforming process operations (i.e., feedstock continues flowing through the remaining reactors without change in feed rate or product octane).
