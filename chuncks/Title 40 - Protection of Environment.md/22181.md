applies to dilution-type systems and means the difference between the measured concentration of low-, mid-, or high-level calibration gas and the certified concentration for each gas when introduced in system calibration mode. For dilution-type systems, a 3-point system calibration error test is conducted in lieu of the analyzer calibration error test, and 2-point system calibration error tests are conducted in lieu of system bias tests.
