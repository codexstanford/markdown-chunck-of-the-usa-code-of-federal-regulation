###### ยง 1051.605 What provisions apply to engines already certified under the motor vehicle program or the Large Spark-ignition program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce into commerce new recreational vehicles, and engines for recreational vehicles, if the engines are already certified to the requirements that apply to spark-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1048 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1051 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1051. See ยง 1051.610 for similar provisions that apply to vehicles that are already certified to the vehicle-based standards for motor vehicles.
