####### Test procedures,Summary of the test.

(c)-(1)(i) In preparation for the test, the flow of test solution through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. The test substance is introduced into each test chamber. The rate at which the test substance is added is adjusted to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in each test chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing mysids acclimated in accordance with the test design into retention chambers within the test and the control chambers. Mysids in the test and control chambers are observed periodically during the test, the dead mysids removed and the findings reported.

(ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, salinity, the concentration of test substance and other water quality characteristics are measured at specified intervals in selected test chambers.

(iii) Data collected during the test are used to develop a MATC (Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration) and quantify effects on specific chronic parameters.
