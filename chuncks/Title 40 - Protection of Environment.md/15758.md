####### ยง 53.53 Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, and cut-off.
######## Flow rate coefficient of variation measurement accuracy.

(4)(i) Using the flow rate coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate test sampler at the completion of the 6-hour test (%CV), determine the accuracy of this reported coefficient of variation as:

(ii) To successfully pass the flow rate CV measurement accuracy test, the absolute difference in values calculated in Equation 5 of this paragraph (g)(4) must not exceed 0.3 (CV%).
