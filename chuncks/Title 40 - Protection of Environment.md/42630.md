###### § 75.21 Quality assurance and quality control requirements.
####### e.g.,

(7) If the designated representative certifies that a particular unit with an SOmonitoring system combusts primarily fuel(s) that are very low sulfur fuel(s) (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) and combusts higher sulfur fuel(s) only for infrequent, non-routine operations (only as emergency backup fuel(s) or for short-term testing), the SOmonitoring system shall be exempted from the RATA requirements of appendices A and B to this part in any calendar year that the unit combusts the higher sulfur fuel(s) for no more than 480 hours. If, in a particular calendar year, the higher-sulfur fuel usage exceeds 480 hours, the owner or operator shall perform a RATA of the SOmonitor (while combusting the higher-sulfur fuel) either by the end of the calendar quarter in which the exceedance occurs or by the end of a 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period (under section 2.3.3 of appendix B to this part) following the quarter in which the exceedance occurs.

(8) The quality assurance provisions of §§ 75.11(e)(3)(i) through 75.11(e)(3)(iv) shall apply to all units with SOmonitoring systems during hours in which only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) is combusted in the unit.

(9) Provided that a unit with an SOmonitoring system is not exempted from the SORATA requirements of this part under paragraphs (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, any calendar quarter during which a unit combusts only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) shall be excluded in determining the quarter in which the next relative accuracy test audit must be performed for the SOmonitoring system. However, no more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse after a relative accuracy test audit of an SOmonitoring system, without a subsequent relative accuracy test audit having been performed. The owner or operator shall ensure that a relative accuracy test audit is performed, in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, either by the end of the eighth successive elapsed calendar quarter since the last RATA or by the end of a 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period, as provided in section 2.3.3 of appendix B to this part.

(10) The owner or operator who, in accordance with § 75.11(e)(1), uses a certified flow monitor and a certified diluent monitor and Equation F-23 in appendix F to this part to calculate SOemissions during hours in which a unit combusts only natural gas or pipeline natural gas (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) shall meet all quality control and quality assurance requirements in appendix B to this part for the flow monitor and the diluent monitor.
