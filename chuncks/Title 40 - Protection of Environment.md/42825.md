######### Moisture correction.

(b)(1) If a correction for the stack gas moisture content is needed to properly calculate the NOemission rate in lb/mmBtu (e.g., if the NOpollutant concentration monitor in a NO-diluent monitoring system measures on a different moisture basis from the diluent monitor), or to calculate the heat input rate, the owner or operator of an affected unit shall account for the moisture content of the flue gas on a continuous basis in accordance with ยง 75.12(b).

(2) If a correction for the stack gas moisture content is needed to properly calculate NOmass emissions in tons, in the case where a NOconcentration monitoring system which measures on a dry basis is used with a flow rate monitor to determine NOmass emissions, the owner or operator of an affected unit shall account for the moisture content of the flue gas on a continuous basis in accordance with ยง 75.11(b) except that the term "SO" shall be replaced by the term "NO."

(3) If a correction for the stack gas moisture content is needed to properly calculate NOmass emissions, in the case where a diluent monitor that measures on a dry basis is used with a flow rate monitor to determine heat input rate, which is then multiplied by the NOemission rate, the owner or operator shall install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system, as described in ยง 75.11(b).
