(7)Upon initial operation, and every three months thereafter, emissions from a randomly selected vehicle with official test value greater than 60% of the standard (determined retrospectively) shall be simultaneously sampled by the normal integration method and by the bag method in each lane. The data from each method shall be put into a historical data base for determining normal and deviant performance for each test lane, facility, and all facilities combined. Specific deviations exceeding +/-5% shall require corrective action.
