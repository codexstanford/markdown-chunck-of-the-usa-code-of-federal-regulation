##### § 76.11 Emissions averaging.
###### Special provisions,Emission limitations.

(d)-(1)Each affected unit in an approved averaging plan is in compliance with the Acid Rain emission limitation for NOunder the plan only if the following requirements are met:

(i) For each unit, the unit's actual annual average emission rate for the calendar year, in lb/mmBtu, is less than or equal to its alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitation in the averaging plan; and

(A) For each unit with an alternative contemporaneous emission limitation less stringent than the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, the actual annual heat input for the calendar year does not exceed the annual heat input limit in the averaging plan;

(B) For each unit with an alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitation more stringent than the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, the actual annual heat input for thecalendar year is not less than the annual heat input limit in the averaging plan; or

(ii) If one or more of the units does not meet the requirements under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the designated representative shall demonstrate, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (Equation 2) that the actual Btu-weighted annual average emission rate for the units in the plan is less than or equal to the Btu-weighted annual average rate for the same units had they each been operated, during the same period of time, in compliance with the applicable emission limitations in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7.

(A) A group showing of compliance shall be made based on the following equation:

(B) For units with an alternative emission limitation, Rshall equal the applicable emission limitation under § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, not the alternative emission limitation.

(C) If there is a successful group showing of compliance under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section for a calendar year, then all units in the averaging plan shall be deemed to be in compliance for that year with their alternative contemporaneous emission limitations and annual heat input limits under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
