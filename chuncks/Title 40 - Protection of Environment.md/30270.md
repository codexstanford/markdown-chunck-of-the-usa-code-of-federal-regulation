######## Ratio for calculating 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rates.

(ii)(A) To calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each combustor as a criterion for you to determine under paragraph (d) of this section if an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride may be waived, you must apportion the total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride (Cl) equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the historical highest Cl/HCl volumetric ratio for all regulatory compliance tests.

(B) You must calculate HCl and Clemission rates (lb/hr) using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.

(C) You must calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate using these HCl and Clemission rates and the equation in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
