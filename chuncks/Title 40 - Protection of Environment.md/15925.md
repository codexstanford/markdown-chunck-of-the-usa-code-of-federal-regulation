######## Internal chamber.

(4)The time required to achieve a stable aerosol depends upon the time during which the aerosol is resident with the surrounding air. This is a function of the internal volume of the aerosol transport system and may be facilitated by recirculating the challenge aerosol. A chamber with a volume of 0.5 mand a recirculating loop (airflow of approximately 500 cfm) is recommended for this purpose. In addition, a baffle is recommended to dissipate the jet of air that the recirculating loop can create. Furthermore, a HEPA filtered hole in the wall of the chamber is suggested to allow makeup air to enter the chamber or excess air to exit the chamber to maintain a system flow balance. The concentration inside the chamber shall be maintained at 1 mg/m+/-20 percent to obtain consistent and significant filter loading.
