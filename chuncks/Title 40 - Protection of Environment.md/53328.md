####### Facilities amending existing plans.

(iv)The owner or operator of a facility submitting an amended plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section after July 31, 2000, including plans that had been previously approved, must also review the plan to determine if it meets or exceeds the applicable provisions of this part. If the plan does not meet or exceed the applicable provisions of this part, the owner or operator must revise and resubmit revised portions of an amended plan to the Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, as appropriate. The plan must meet or exceed the applicable provisions of this part.

(b)(1) The Regional Administrator may at any time require the owner or operator of any non-transportation-related onshore facility to prepare and submit a facility response plan under this section after considering the factors in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If such a determination is made, the Regional Administrator shall notify the facility owner or operator in writing and shall provide a basis for the determination. If the Regional Administrator notifies the owner or operator in writing of the requirement to prepare and submit a response plan under this section, the owner or operator of the facility shall submit the response plan to the Regional Administrator within six months of receipt of such written notification.

(2) The Regional Administrator shall review plans submitted by such facilities to determine whether the facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.

(c) The Regional Administrator shall determine whether a facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, based on the factors in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If such a determination is made, the Regional Administrator shall notify the owner or operator of the facility in writing and:

(1) Promptly review the facility response plan;

(2) Require amendments to any response plan that does not meet the requirements of this section;

(3) Approve any response plan that meets the requirements of this section; and

(4) Review each response plan periodically thereafter on a schedule established by the Regional Administrator provided that the period between plan reviews does not exceed five years.

(d)(1) The owner or operator of a facility for which a response plan is required under this part shall revise and resubmit revised portions of the response plan within 60 days of each facility change that materially may affect the response to a worst case discharge, including:

(i) A change in the facility's configuration that materially alters the information included in the response plan;

(ii) A change in the type of oil handled, stored, or transferred that materially alters the required response resources;

(iii) A material change in capabilities of the oil spill removal organization(s) that provide equipment and personnel to respond to discharges of oil described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section;

(iv) A material change in the facility's spill prevention and response equipment or emergency response procedures; and

(v) Any other changes that materially affect the implementation of the response plan.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, amendments to personnel and telephone number lists included in the response plan and a change in the oil spill removal organization(s) that does not result in a material change in support capabilities do not require approval by the Regional Administrator. Facility owners or operators shall provide a copy of such changes to the Regional Administrator as the revisions occur.

(3) The owner or operator of a facility that submits changes to a response plan as provided in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section shall provide the EPA-issued facility identification number (where one has been assigned) with the changes.

(4) The Regional Administrator shall review for approval changes to a response plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a facility determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section to have the potential to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment.

(e) If the owner or operator of a facility determines pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section that the facility could not, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, the owner or operator shall complete and maintain at the facility the certification form contained in appendix C to this part and, in the event an alternative formula that is comparable to one contained in appendix C to this part is used to evaluate the criterion in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the owner or operator shall attach documentation to the certification form that demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness of the comparable formula and shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing that an alternative formula was used.

(f)(1) A facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if it meets any of the following criteria applied in accordance with the flowchart contained in attachment C-I to appendix C to this part:

(i) The facility transfers oil over water to or from vessels and has a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons; or

(ii) The facility's total oil storage capacity is greater than or equal to 1 million gallons, and one of the following is true:

(A) The facility does not have secondary containment for each aboveground storage area sufficiently large to contain the capacity of the largest aboveground oil storage tank within each storage area plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation;

(B) The facility is located at a distance (as calculated using the appropriate formula in appendix C to this part or a comparable formula) such that a discharge from the facility could cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III of the "Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments" (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability) and the applicable Area Contingency Plan prepared pursuant to section 311(j)(4) of the Clean Water Act;

(C) The facility is located at a distance (as calculated using the appropriate formula in appendix C to this part or a comparable formula) such that a discharge from the facility would shut down a public drinking water intake; or

(D) The facility has had a reportable oil discharge in an amount greater than or equal to 10,000 gallons within the last 5 years.

(2)(i) To determine whether a facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall consider the following:

(A) Type of transfer operation;

(B) Oil storage capacity;

(C) Lack of secondary containment;

(D) Proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments and other areas determined by the Regional Administrator to possess ecological value;

(E) Proximity to drinking water intakes;

(F) Spill history; and

(G) Other site-specific characteristics and environmental factors that the Regional Administrator determines to be relevant to protecting the environment from harm by discharges of oil into or on navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.

(ii) Any person, including a member of the public or any representative from a Federal, State, or local agency who believes that a facility subject to this section could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines may petition the Regional Administrator to determine whether the facility meets the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Such petition shall include a discussion of how the factors in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section apply to the facility in question. The RA shall consider such petitions and respond in an appropriate amount of time.

(3) To determine whether a facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, the Regional Administrator may consider the factors in paragraph (f)(2) of this section as well as the following:

(i) Frequency of past discharges;

(ii) Proximity to navigable waters;

(iii) Age of oil storage tanks; and

(iv) Other facility-specific and Region-specific information, including local impacts on public health.
