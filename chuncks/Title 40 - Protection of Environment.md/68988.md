(2) The implementing agency may approve another method if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability with which it can be detected. If the method is approved, the owner and operator must comply with any conditions imposed by the implementing agency on its use to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.
