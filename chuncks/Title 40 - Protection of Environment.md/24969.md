###### ยง 62.16718 Test methods and procedures.
####### e.g.,

(e) For the performance test required in ยง 62.16714(c)(2), EPA Method 25 or 25C (EPA Method 25C may be used at the inlet only) of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 parts-per-million by volume outlet NMOC concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by ยง 62.16724(d)(2). EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3C of appendix A-2 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 parts-per-million NMOC as carbon (8 parts-per-million NMOC as hexane), EPA Method 25A should be used in place of EPA Method 25. EPA Method 18 of appendix A-6 of 40 CFR part 60 may be used in conjunction with EPA Method 25A on a limited basis (compound specific,methane) or EPA Method 3C may be used to determine methane. The methane as carbon should be subtracted from the EPA Method 25A total hydrocarbon value as carbon to give NMOC concentration as carbon. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration as carbon by 6 to convert the Cas carbon to Cas hexane. Equation 4 must be used to calculate efficiency:
