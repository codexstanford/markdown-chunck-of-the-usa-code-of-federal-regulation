If the standard-setting part requires durability testing, you must accumulate service in a way that represents how you expect the engine to operate in use. You may accumulate service hours using an accelerated schedule, such as through continuous operation or by using duty cycles that are more aggressive than in-use operation, subject to any pre-approval requirements established in the applicable standard-setting part.
