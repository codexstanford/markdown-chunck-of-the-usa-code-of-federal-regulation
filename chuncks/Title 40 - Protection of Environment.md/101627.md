(c)The emission-related warranty covers all your components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component for you. Your emission-related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.
