####### ยง 53.53 Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, and cut-off.
######## Flow rate cut-off.

(5)(i) Inspect the measurements of the sample flow rate during the flow rate cut-off test and determine the time at which the sample flow rate decreased to a value less than the cut-off value specified in table E-1 of this subpart. To pass this test, the sampler must have automatically stopped the sample flow at least 30 seconds but not more than 90 seconds after the time at which the sampler flow rate was determined to have decreased to a value less than the cut-off value.

(ii) At the completion of the flow rate cut-off test, download the archived data from the test sampler and verify that the sampler's required Flow-out-of-spec and Incorrect sample period flag indicators are properly set.
