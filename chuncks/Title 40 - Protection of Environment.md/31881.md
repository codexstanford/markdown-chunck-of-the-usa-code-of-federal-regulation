() While boiling, the vessel must be operated with a properly operated process condenser. An initial demonstration that a process condenser is properly operated is required for vessels that operate process condensers without secondary condensers that are air pollution control devices. The owner or operator must either measure the condenser exhaust gas temperature and show it is less than the boiling point of the substance(s) in the vessel, or perform a material balance around the vessel and condenser to show that at least 99 percent of the material vaporized while boiling is condensed. Uncontrolled emissions are assumed to be zero under these conditions. The initial demonstration shall be conducted for all appropriate operating scenarios and documented in the Notification of Compliance Status report as specified in ยง 63.1368(f).
