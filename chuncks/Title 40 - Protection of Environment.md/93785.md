####### Reports.

(h)Beginning 12 months after the date of program authorization, the primary agency for each State or Indian Tribe that has an authorized program shall submit a written report to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the State or Indian Tribe is located. This report shall be submitted at least once every 12 months for the first 3 years after program authorization. If these reports demonstrate successful program implementation, the Agency will automatically extend the reporting interval to every 2 years. If the subsequent reports demonstrate problems with implementation, EPA will require a return to annual reporting until the reports demonstrate successful program implementation, at which time the Agency will extend the reporting interval to every 2 years. The report shall include the following information:

(1) Any significant changes in the content or administration of the State or Tribal program implemented since the previous reporting period; and

(2) All information regarding the lead-based paint enforcement and compliance activities listed at ยง 745.327(d) "Summary on Progress and Performance."
