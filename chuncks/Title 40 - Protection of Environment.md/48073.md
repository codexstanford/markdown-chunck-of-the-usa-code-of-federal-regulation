(2) Optionally, instead of the process described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, when computing Tier 2 NOcredits using the formula in § 86.1861-04(b)(1), the manufacturer may multiply the number of vehicles certified to bin 1 and bin 2 by the applicable multiplier shown in Table S04-11 in paragraph (h)(1) of this section when computing the "Total number of Tier 2 Vehicles Sold, Including ZEVs and HEVs".
