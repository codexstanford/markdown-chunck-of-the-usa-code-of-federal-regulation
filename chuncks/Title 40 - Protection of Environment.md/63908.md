() All vessels used for dredged material transportation and disposal must be loaded to no more than 80 percent by volume of the vessel. Before any disposal vessel departs for the SF-DODS, an independent quality control inspector must certify in writing that the vessel meets the conditions and requirements of a certification checklist that contains all of the substantive elements found in the example contained in the most current SMMP Implementation Manual. For the purposes of paragraph (l)(3)(viii) of this section, "independent" means not an employee of the permittee or dredging contractor; however, the Corps of Engineers may provide inspectors for Corps of Engineers dredged material disposal projects.
