####### Produce thereof,

when used with respect to plants containing plant- incorporated protectants only, means a product of a living plant containing a plant-incorporated protectant, where the pesticidal substance is intended to serve a pesticidal purpose after the product has been separated from the living plant. Examples of such products include, but are not limited to, agricultural produce, grains, and lumber. Products such as raw agricultural commodities bearing pesticide chemical residues are not "produce thereof" when the residues are not intended to serve a pesticidal purpose in the produce.
