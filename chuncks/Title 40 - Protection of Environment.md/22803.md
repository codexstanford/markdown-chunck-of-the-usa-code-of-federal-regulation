###### Standard Addition and Dynamic Spiking Procedure.

8The standard addition procedure consists of measuring the native source gas concentration, addition of reference gas, and measurement of the resulting SA elevated source gas concentration. For extractive CEMS, HCl is spiked dynamically and thus, one must account for the dilution of sample gas from the addition of the HCl reference gas. For IP-CEMS, standard addition of an HCl reference gas is made by either adding an HCl reference gas to a flow through cell or inserting a sealed reference gas cell into the measurement path of the CEMS. The enclosed cell or a fixed cell must contain an HCl concentration that accounts for the difference in path length of the cell used for SA relative to the measurement path.
