####### Low-hour

means relating to an engine that is considered to have stabilized emissions and represents the undeteriorated emission level. A low-hour engine typically operates no more than a few hours beyond the minimum stabilization period. However, a low-hour engine could have more hours as long as emissions remain stable. In the absence of other information, a low-hour engine with a useful life of 300 hours or less would generally have operated no more than 15 hours and a low-hour engine with a longer useful life would generally have operated no more than 24 hours.
