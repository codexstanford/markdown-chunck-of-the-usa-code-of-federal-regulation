######## Capture system bypass line.

(b)You must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.

(1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line.

(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the nondiverting position with a car-seal or lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the nondiverting position, and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
