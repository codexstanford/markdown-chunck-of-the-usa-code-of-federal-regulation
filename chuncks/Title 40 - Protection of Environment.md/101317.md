###### ยง 1045.103 What exhaust emission standards must my outboard and personal watercraft engines meet?

(a) Duty-cycle emission standards. Starting in the 2010 model year, exhaust emissions from your outboard and personal watercraft engines may not exceed emission standards as follows:

(1) Measure emissions using the applicable steady-state test procedures described in subpart F of this part.

(2) The exhaust emission standards from the following table apply:

(3) For engines whose standard depends on maximum engine power, round the calculated HC + NOemission standard to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr; round the calculated CO emission standard to the nearest g/kW-hr. Determine maximum engine power for the engine family as described in ยง 1045.140.
