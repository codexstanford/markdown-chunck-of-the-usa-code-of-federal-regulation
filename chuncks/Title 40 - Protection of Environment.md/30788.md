()The owner or operator shall calculate the concentrations of HAP compounds in wastewater considering the total quantity of HAP discharged to the water, the amount of water at the POD, and the amounts of water and solvent lost to other mechanisms such as reactions, air emissions, or uptake in product or other processing materials. The quantities of HAP and water shall be based on batch sheets, manufacturing tickets, or FDA bills of materials. In cases where a chemical reaction occurs that generates or consumes HAP, the amount of HAP remaining after a reaction shall be based on stoichometry assuming 100 percent theoretical consumption or yield, as applicable.
