####### Consideration of exposure.

(3)EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:

(i) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components;

(ii) Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern;

(iii) Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and

(iv) Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures.
