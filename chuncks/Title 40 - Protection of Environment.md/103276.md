(c) Estimate the maximum expected COconcentration during emission testing,. Make this estimate at the sample system location where the blended NO and COspan gases are introduced according to ยง 1065.370(d)(10). When estimating the maximum expected COconcentration, consider the maximum expected COcontent in fuel combustion products and dilution air.

(d) Calculate quench as follows:
