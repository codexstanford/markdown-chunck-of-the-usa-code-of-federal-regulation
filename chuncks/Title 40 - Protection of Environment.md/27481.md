####### Calculation methods for determining combustion zone net heating value.

(m)The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value of the combustion zone gas (NHV) as specified in paragraph (m)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, determine the 15-minute block average NHVbased on the 15-minute block average vent gas and assist gas flow rates using the following equation. For periods when there is no assist steam flow or premix assist air flow, NHV= NHV.

(2) Owners or operators of flares that use the feed-forward calculation methodology in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section and that monitor gas composition or net heating value in a location representative of the cumulative vent gas stream and that directly monitor flare supplemental gas flow additions to the flare must determine the 15-minute block average NHVusing the following equation.
