####### Gasoline catalysts.

(ii)For the purposes of determining the catalyst system malfunction criteria in paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer must use a catalyst system deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using methods established by the manufacturer to represent real world catalyst deterioration under normal and malfunctioning operating conditions. The malfunction criteria must be established by using a catalyst system with all monitored and unmonitored (downstream of the sensor utilized for catalyst monitoring) catalysts simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria except for those engines that use fuel shutoff to prevent over-fueling during engine misfire conditions. For such engines, the malfunction criteria must be established by using a catalyst system with all monitored catalysts simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria while unmonitored catalysts shall be deteriorated to the end of the engine's useful life.
