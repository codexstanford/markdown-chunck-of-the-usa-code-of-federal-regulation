3.2.1The USCG planning level that corresponds to EPA's "small discharge" is termed "the average most probable discharge." A USCG rule found at 33 CFR 154.1020 defines "the average most probable discharge" as the lesser of 50 barrels (2,100 gallons) or 1 percent of the volume of the worst case discharge. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport petroleum oils must compare oil discharge volumes for a small discharge and an average most probable discharge, and plan for whichever quantity is greater.
