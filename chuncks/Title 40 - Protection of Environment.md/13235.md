(a) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Kansas and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR SOGroup 2 Trading Program in subpart DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements. The obligation to comply with such requirements will be eliminated with regard to sources and units in the State by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Kansas' State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan under ยง 52.39 for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Kansas' SIP.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Kansas' SIP revision described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR SOGroup 2 allowances under subpart DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart DDDDD of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR SOGroup 2 allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.
