###### ยง 796.1950 Vapor pressure.
####### Data and reporting.

(c)(1) Report the triplicate calculated vapor pressures for the test material at each temperature, the average calculated vapor pressure at each temperature, and the standard deviation.

(2) Provide a description of analytical methods used to analyze for the test material and all analytical results.

(3) For the isoteniscope procedure, include the plot of p vs. the reciprocal of the temperature in K, developed during the degasing step and showing linearity in the region of 298.15 K (25 &#xB0;C) and any other required test temperatures.

(4) For the gas saturation procedure, include the data on the calculation of vapor pressure at three or more gas flow rates at each test temperature, showing no dependence on flow rate. Include a description of sorbents and solvents employed and the desorption efficiency calculations.

(5) Provide a description of any difficulties experienced or any other pertinent information.
