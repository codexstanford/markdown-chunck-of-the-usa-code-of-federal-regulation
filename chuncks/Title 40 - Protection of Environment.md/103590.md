(f)Follow the steps described for systems with regeneration events to calculateand, omitting the steps related to regeneration events. Thewill be well below the. Follow the steps given below to adjust the cycle until you meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

(1) Increase the temperature of the highest temperature mode. Use good engineering judgment to ensure that this temperature does not exceed the limits of the catalyst in a way that might cause rapid deactivation or failure via a mechanism that is not considered normal degradation.

(2) Increase the duration of the highest temperature mode and decrease the duration of the other modes in proportion. You may not increase the duration highest temperature mode by more than a factor of 2.
