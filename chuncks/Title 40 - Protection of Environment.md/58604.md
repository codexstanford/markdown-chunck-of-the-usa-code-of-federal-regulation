####### Mutagenicity studies.

(5)For each test substance a battery of tests is required to assess the potential to affect the mammalian cell's genetic components. The objectives underlying the selection of a battery of tests for mutagenicity assessment are:

(i) To detect, with sensitive assay methods, the capacity of a chemical to alter genetic material in cells.

(ii) To determine the relevance of these mutagenic changes to mammals.

(iii) When mutagenic potential is demonstrated, to incorporate these findings in the assessment of heritable effects, carcinogenicity, and, possibly, other health effects.
