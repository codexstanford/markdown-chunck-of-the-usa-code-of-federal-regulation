###### Design Criteria
####### ยง 257.73 Structural integrity criteria for existing CCR surface impoundments.
######## Changes in hazard potential classification.

(iii)(A) If the owner or operator of a CCR unit determines during a periodic hazard potential assessment that the CCR unit is no longer classified as either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment or a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, then the owner or operator of the CCR unit is no longer subject to the requirement to prepare and maintain a written EAP beginning on the date the periodic hazard potential assessment documentation is placed in the facility's operating record as required by ยง 257.105(f)(5).

(B) If the owner or operator of a CCR unit classified as a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment subsequently determines that the CCR unit is properly re-classified as either a high hazard potential CCR surface impoundment or a significant hazard potential CCR surface impoundment, then the owner or operator of the CCR unit must prepare a written EAP for the CCR unit as required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section within six months of completing such periodic hazard potential assessment.

(iv) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the written EAP, and any subsequent amendment of the EAP, meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
