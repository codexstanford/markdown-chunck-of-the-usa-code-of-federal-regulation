(3)(i) Authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated local air quality conservation authority with the same authority as the State (ยง 51.230(f) of this chapter).

(c) The requirements of ยง 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.
