###### Interim Emissions Standards and Operating Limits For Incinerators, Cement Kilns, and Lightweight Aggregate Kilns
####### ยง 63.1204 What are the standards for hazardous waste burning cement kilns that are effective until compliance with the standards under ยง 63.1220?
######## Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.

(5)(i) For kilns equipped with a by-pass duct or midkiln gas sampling system, either:

(A) Carbon monoxide in the by-pass duct or mid-kiln gas sampling system in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by ยง 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons in the by-pass duct or mid-kiln gas sampling system do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(B) Hydrocarbons in the by-pass duct or midkiln gas sampling system in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(ii) For kilns not equipped with a by-pass duct or midkiln gas sampling system, either:

(A) Hydrocarbons in the main stack in excess of 20 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(B) Carbon monoxide in the main stack in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, you also must document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by ยง 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons in the main stack do not exceed 20 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane.

(6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 130 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid equivalents, dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) Particulate matter in excess of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed and opacity greater than 20 percent.

(i) You must use suitable methods to determine the kiln raw material feedrate.

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, you must compute the particulate matter emission rate, E, from the following equation:

(iii) If you operate a preheater or preheater/precalciner kiln with dual stacks, you must test simultaneously and compute the combined particulate matter emission rate, E, from the following equation:
