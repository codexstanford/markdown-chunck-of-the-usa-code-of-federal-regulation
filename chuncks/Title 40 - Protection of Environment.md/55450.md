(2) For new facilities, the permitting authority determines that the 30-day average and 7-day average BODand SS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment works, considering the design capability of the treatment process and geographical and climatic conditions, would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations.
