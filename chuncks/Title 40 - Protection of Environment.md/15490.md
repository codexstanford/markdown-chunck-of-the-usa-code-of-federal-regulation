###### Zero drift,24 hour

6.3.2(). From the zero values measured each 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between successive readings expressed in volumetric flow rate units. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval of these differences using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the zero drift.
