####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Capture and control to achieve mass fraction of coating solids applied limit (ยง 63.3320(b)(3)).

(g)Operate a capture system and control device and limit the organic HAP emission rate from an existing affected source to no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP emitted per kg coating solids applied, and from a new affected source to no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP emitted per kg coating solids applied as determined on a monthly average as-applied basis. If the affected source operates more than one capture system, more than one control device, one or more never-controlled work stations, or one or more intermittently-controlled work stations, then you must demonstrate compliance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (o) of this section. Otherwise, you must demonstrate compliance following the procedure in paragraph (j) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by a solvent recovery device or the procedure in paragraph (l) of this section when emissions are controlled by an oxidizer.
