###### ยง 1065.690 Buoyancy correction for PM sample media.
####### Air density.

(c)Because a PM balance environment must be tightly controlled to an ambient temperature of (22 +/-1) &#xB0;C and humidity has an insignificant effect on buoyancy correction, air density is primarily a function of atmospheric pressure. Therefore you may use nominal constant values for temperature and humidity when determining the air density of the balance environment in Eq. 1065.690-2.
