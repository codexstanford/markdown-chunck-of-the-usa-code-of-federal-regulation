(134) On July 18, 2000, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted revised rules for particulate matter. Ohio adopted these revisions to address State-level appeals by various industry groups of rules that the State adopted in 1995 that EPA approved in 1996. The revisions provide reformulated limitations on fugitive emissions from storage piles and plant roadways, selected revisions to emission limits in the Cleveland area, provisions for Ohio to follow specified criteria to issue replicable equivalent visible emission limits, the correction of limits for stationary combustion engines, and requirements for continuous emissions monitoring as mandated by 40 CFR part 51, Appendix P. The State's submittal also included modeling to demonstrate that the revised Cleveland area emission limits continue to provide for attainment of the PMstandards. EPA is disapproving two paragraphs that would allow revision of limits applicable to Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant through permit revisions without the full EPA review provided in the Clean Air Act.
