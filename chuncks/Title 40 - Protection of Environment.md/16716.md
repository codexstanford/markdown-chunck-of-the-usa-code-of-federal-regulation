###### One-Point Flow Rate Verification Bias Estimate for,PM,PM,and Pb,meas,audit,n,AB,d,AS,d

4.2.2. For each one-point flow rate verification, calculate the percent difference in volume using equation 1 of this appendix whereis the value indicated by the sampler's volume measurement andis the actual volume indicated by the auditing flow meter. The absolute volume bias upper bound is then calculated using equation 3, whereis the number of flow rate audits being aggregated; tis the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, the quantityis the mean of the absolute values of theand is calculated using equation 4 of this appendix, and the quantityin equation 3 of this appendix is the standard deviation of the absolute values if theand is calculated using equation 5 of this appendix.
