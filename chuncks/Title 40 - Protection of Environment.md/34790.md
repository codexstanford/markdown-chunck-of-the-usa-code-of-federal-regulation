######## Emission rate with add-on controls option.

(c)Demonstrate that, based on data on the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation(s) and the emission reductions achieved by emission capture and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) meet the operating limits required in § 63.4092, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.4093.
