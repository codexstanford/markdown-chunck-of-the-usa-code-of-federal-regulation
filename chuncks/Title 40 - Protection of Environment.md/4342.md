###### Calibration Slope, Intercept, and Correlation Coefficient.

12.1The method of least squares is used to calculate a calibration equation in the form of:

The slope (m), intercept (b), and correlation coefficient (r) are calculated as follows:

A data form (Figure 5) is supplied for easily organizing calibration data when the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient are calculated by hand.
