####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide clofentezine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only clofentezine, 3,6-bis(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide clofentezine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of clofentezine, 3,6-bis(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, and its metabolite, 3-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of clofentezine, in or on commodity.
