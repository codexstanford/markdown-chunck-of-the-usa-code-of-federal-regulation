####### i.e.,

(viii) Total annual COmass emissions measured by the CEMS, expressed in metric tons. If any of the units burn both fossil fuels and biomass, separately report the annual non-biogenic COmass emissions (COfrom fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, COfrom sorbent and/or process CO) and the annual COmass emissions from biomass combustion, each expressed in metric tons.

(ix) An estimate of the heat input from each type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year.

(x) For each type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CHand NO mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of COe.

(xi) If applicable, the plant code (as defined in ยง 98.6).
