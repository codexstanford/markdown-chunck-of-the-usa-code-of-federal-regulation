(1) An acute aquatic ECof 1 mg/L or less.

(2) An acute aquatic ECof 20 mg/L or less where the ratio of aquatic vertebrate 24-hour to 48-hour ECis greater than or equal to 2.0.

(3) A Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration (MATC) of less than or equal to 100 parts per billion (100 ppb).

(4) An acute aquatic ECof 20 mg/L or less coupled with either a measured bioconcentration factor (BCF) equal to or greater than 1,000x or in the absence of bioconcentration data a log P value equal to or greater than 4.3.
