(D) To measure the total organic regulated material concentration at the outlet of a control device, use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14). If you have a combustion control device, you must first determine which regulated material compounds are present in the inlet gas stream using process knowledge or the screening procedure described in Method 18. In conducting the performance test, analyze samples collected at the outlet of the combustion control device as specified in Method 18 or ASTM D6420-18 for the regulated material compounds present at the inlet of the control device. The method ASTM D6420-18 may be used only under the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(D)() through () of this section.
