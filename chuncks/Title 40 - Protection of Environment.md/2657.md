######## Real property acquisition.,See

(5)If EPA determines in the remedy selection process that an interest in real property must be acquired in order to conduct a response action, such acquisition may be funded under a Cooperative Agreement. EPA may acquire an interest in real estate for the purpose of conducting a remedial action only if the State provides assurance that it will accept transfer of such interest in accordance with 40 CFR 300.510(f) of the NCP. The State must provide this assurance even if it intends to transfer this interest to a third party, or to allow a political subdivision to accept transfer on behalf of the State. If the political subdivision is accepting the transferred interest in real property, the State must guarantee that it will accept transfer of such interest in the event of default by the political subdivision. If the State or political subdivision disposes of the transferred real property, it shall comply with the requirements for real property in 2 CFR 200.311. (ยง 35.6400 for additional information on real property acquisition requirements.)
