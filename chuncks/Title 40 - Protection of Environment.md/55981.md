###### ยง 141.81 Applicability of corrosion control treatment steps to small, medium, and large water systems.
####### Step 1.

(1)(i) A water system other than those covered in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section must recommend optimal corrosion control treatment (ยง 141.82(a)(1), (2), (3), or (4)) within six months after the end of the tap sampling period during which it exceeds either the lead trigger level or copper action level.

(ii) A water system with lead service lines that exceeds the lead action level must harvest lead pipes from the distribution system and construct flow-through pipe loops and operate the loops with finished water within one year after the end of the tap sampling period during which it exceeds the lead action level. These water systems must proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (e)(3) of this section and conduct the corrosion control studies for optimization under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section using the pipe loops.

(iii) Large water systems under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section must conduct the corrosion control studies for optimization under paragraph (e)(3) of this section (Step 3).
