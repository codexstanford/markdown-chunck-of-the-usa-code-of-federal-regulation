###### ยง 141.403 Treatment technique requirements for ground water systems.
####### Ground water systems serving 3,300 or fewer people.

(B)A ground water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people must monitor the residual disinfectant concentration using analytical methods specified in ยง 141.74(a)(2) at a location approved by the State and record the residual disinfection concentration each day that water from the ground water source is served to the public. The ground water system must maintain the State-determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the ground water system serves water from the ground water source to the public. The ground water system must take a daily grab sample during the hour of peak flow or at another time specified by the State. If any daily grab sample measurement falls below the State-determined residual disinfectant concentration, the ground water system must take follow-up samples every four hours until the residual disinfectant concentration is restored to the State-determined level. Alternatively, a ground water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people may monitor continuously and meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
