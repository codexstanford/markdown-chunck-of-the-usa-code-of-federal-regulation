####### Redesignation.

(mm)Approval-On February 11, 2020, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate the Shoreline Sheboygan County area to attainment of the 2008 8-hour ozone standard. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in eight years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2025 and 2032 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the area. The 2025 MVEBs for the Inland Sheboygan County area are 0.50 tons per hot summer day for VOC and 1.00 tons per hot summer day for NO. The 2032 MVEBs for the Inland Sheboygan County area are 0.36 tons per hot summer day for VOC and 0.77 tons per hot summer day for NO.
