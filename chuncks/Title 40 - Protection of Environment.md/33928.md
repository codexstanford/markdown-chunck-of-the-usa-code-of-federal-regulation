######## Allowable HAP loss

means the gallons of HAP that would have been lost from a source if the source was operating at the solvent loss factor for each listed oilseed type. The allowable HAP loss in gallons is determined by multiplying the tons of each oilseed type processed during the previous 12 operating months, as determined in accordance with ยง 63.2855, by the corresponding oilseed solvent loss factor (gal/ton) listed in Table 1 of ยง 63.2840, and by the dimensionless constant 0.64, and summing the result for all oilseed types processed.
