###### ยง 770.3 Definitions.
####### Panel

means a thin (usually less than two inches thick), flat, usually rectangular piece of particleboard, medium-density fiberboard or hardwood plywood. Embossing or imparting of an irregular surface on the composite wood products by the original panel producer during pressing does not remove the product from this definition. Cutting a panel into smaller pieces, without additional fabrication, does not make the panel into a component part or finished good. This does not include items made for the purpose of research and development, provided such items are not sold, supplied, or offered for sale.
