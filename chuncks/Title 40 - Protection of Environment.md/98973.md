####### Physiologically-based modeling.

(5)Traditional methods of modeling have been used to determine kinetic parameters associated with drug and xenobiotic disposition, but have assumed a purely mathematical construct of mammalian organisms in their operation. On the other hand, more recent models which take into account the physiological processes of the animal have been used with success in defining biological determinants of chemical disposition as well as the relationship between tissue dose and tissue response. These so-called physiologically-based models, also allow for cross-species extrapolation which is often necessary in the risk-assessment process. The use of physiologically-based modeling as an experimental tool for addressing specific issues related to biotransformation and pharmacokinetics of a test substance is encouraged. Information as derived from physiologically-based modeling experiments may aid in the comparison of biotransformation and pharmacokinetics of a test substance between animal species and humans, and in the assessment of risk under specific exposure conditions. At the discretion of the Agency, or by mutual agreement, results of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) studies with parent compound may be submitted in lieu of other studies, if it is determined that such data would provide adequate information to satisfy this guideline.
