####### Heat exchange system,i.e.,,heat exchange system,heat exchange system,heat exchange system.

means a device or collection of devices used to transfer heat from process fluids to water without intentional direct contact of the process fluid with the water (non-contact heat exchanger) and to transport and/or cool the water in a closed-loop recirculation system (cooling tower system) or a once-through system (e.g., river or pond water). For closed-loop recirculation systems, theconsists of a cooling tower, all petroleum refinery process unit heat exchangers that are in organic HAP service, as defined in this subpart, serviced by that cooling tower, and all water lines to and from these petroleum refinery process unit heat exchangers. For once-through systems, theconsists of all heat exchangers that are in organic HAP service, as defined in this subpart, servicing an individual petroleum refinery process unit and all water lines to and from these heat exchangers. Sample coolers or pump seal coolers are not considered heat exchangers for the purpose of this definition and are not part of theIntentional direct contact with process fluids results in the formation of a wastewater.
