###### Sample Analysis.

11.2For each set of determinations, prepare a reagent blank by adding 10 mL TCM absorbing solution to a 25-mL volumetric flask, and two control standards containing approximately 5 and 15 Âµg SO, respectively. The control standards are prepared according to Section 10.2 or 10.3. The analysis is carried out as follows:

1. Allow the sample to stand 20 minutes after the completion of sampling to allow any ozone to decompose (if applicable).

2. To each 25-mL volumetric flask containing reagent blank, sample, or control standard, add 1 mL of 0.6% sulfamic acid (Section 8.2.1) and allow to react for 10 min.

3. Accurately pipet 2 mL of 0.2% formaldehyde solution (Section 8.2.2) and then 5 mL of pararosaniline solution (Section 8.2.13) into each flask. Start a laboratory timer set at 30 minutes.

4. Bring each flask to volume with recently boiled and cooled distilled water and mix thoroughly.

5. During the 30 minutes, the solutions must be in a temperature controlled environment in the range of 20&#xB0; to 30 &#xB0;C maintained to +/-1 &#xB0;C. This temperature must also be within 1 &#xB0;C of that used during calibration.
