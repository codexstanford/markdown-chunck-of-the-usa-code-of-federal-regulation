###### ยง 1090.815 Deactivation (involuntary cancellation) of registration.
####### Process for deactivation.

(b)Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, EPA will use the following process whenever it decides to deactivate the registration of a party:

(1) EPA will provide written notification to the RCO identifying the reasons or deficiencies for which EPA intends to deactivate the party's registration. The party will have 30 calendar days from the date of the notification to correct the deficiencies identified or explain why there is no need for corrective action.

(2) If the basis for EPA's notice of intent to deactivate registration is the absence of activity under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a stated intent to engage in activity will be sufficient to avoid deactivation of registration.

(3) If the party does not correct identified deficiencies under paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section, EPA may deactivate the party's registration without further notice to the party.
