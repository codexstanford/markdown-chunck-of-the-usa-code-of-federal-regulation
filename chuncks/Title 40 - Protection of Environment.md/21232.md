###### Model Rule - Emission Limits, Emission Standards, and Operating Limits and Requirements
####### ยง 60.5180 Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?
######## i.e.,

The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time). For determining compliance with the CO concentration limit using CO CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured CO concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other CO concentrations (corrected to 7 percent O) to determine the 24-hour average value.
