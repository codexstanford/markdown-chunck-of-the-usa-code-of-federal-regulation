(v) For each delayed repair, identification of the monitoring location associated with the leak for which repair is delayed, the date when the delay of repair began, the date the repair is expected to be completed (if the leak is not repaired during the reporting period), the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate and date of each monitoring event conducted on the delayed repair during the reporting period, and an estimate in pounds of the potential total hydrocarbon emissions over the reporting period associated with the delayed repair.

(17) For process vents and storage tanks in ethylene oxide service subject to the requirements of § 63.2493, the compliance report must include:

(i) The periods specified in § 63.2525(s)(4). Indicate the date and start and end times for each period.
