####### Measures Addressing Limited Disapproval Associated With SO

(f). The deficiencies associated with SOidentified in EPA's limited disapproval of the regional haze plan submitted by Michigan on November 5, 2010, are satisfied by ยง 52.1187.

(g) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted on November 5, 2010, does not meet the best available retrofit technology requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOand SOfrom Saint Marys Cement in Charlevoix and NOfrom Escanaba Paper Company in Escanaba. These requirements for these two facilities are satisfied by 40 CFR 52.1183(h) and 40 CFR 52.1183(i), respectively.

(h)(1) For the 30-day period beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, Saint Marys Cement, or any subsequent owner or operator of the Saint Marys Cement facility located in Charlevoix, Michigan, shall not cause or permit the emission of oxides of nitrogen (expressed as NO) to exceed 2.80 lb per ton of clinker as a 30-day rolling average.

(2) For the 12-month period beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, Saint Marys Cement, or any subsequent owner or operator of the Saint Marys Cement facility located in Charlevoix, Michigan, shall not cause or permit the emission of NO(expressed as NO) to exceed 2.40 lb per ton of clinker as a 12-month average.

(3) Saint Marys Cement, or any subsequent owner or operator of the Saint Marys Cement facility located in Charlevoix, Michigan, shall not cause or permit the emission of SOto exceed 7.50 lb per ton of clinker as a 12-month average.

(4) Saint Marys Cement, or any subsequent owner or operator of the Saint Marys Cement facility located in Charlevoix, Michigan, shall operate continuous emission monitoring systems to measure NOand SOemissions from its kiln system in conformance with 40 CFR part 60 appendix F procedure 1.

(5) The reference test method for assessing compliance with the limit in paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be use of a continuous emission monitoring system operated in conformance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, procedure 1. A new 30-day average shall be computed at the end of each calendar day in which the kiln operates, based on the following procedure: First, sum the total pounds of NO(expressed as NO) emitted during the operating day and the previous twenty-nine operating days, second, sum the total tons of clinker produced during the same period, and third, divide the total number of pounds by the total clinker produced during the thirty operating days.

(6) The reference test method for assessing compliance with the limit in paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) of this section shall be use of a continuous emission monitoring system operated in conformance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, procedure 1. A new 12-month average shall be computed at the end of each calendar month, based on the following procedure: First, sum the total pounds of NOor SO, as applicable, emitted from the unit during the month and the previous eleven calendar months, second, sum the total tons of clinker production during the same period, and third, divide the total number of pounds of emissions of NOor SO, as applicable, by the total clinker production during the twelve calendar months.
