####### e.g.,

(ii) For at least one cooling pond that is considered part of your gypsum dewatering stack system, you may choose to use lime (or any other caustic substance) to raise the pH of the liquid (the condensed vapors from the flash cooler and evaporators, and scrubbing liquid) discharged into the cooling pond. If you choose this control measure, then you must include in the plan the method used to raise the pH of the liquid discharged into the cooling pond, the target pH value (of the liquid discharged into the cooling pond) expected to be achieved by using the method, and the analyses used to determine and support the raise in pH.

(iii) For all cooling ponds that are considered part of your gypsum dewatering stack system, you may choose to reduce the total cooling pond surface area based on a facility specific evaluation plan. If you choose this control measure, then you must include in the facility specific evaluation plan certified by an independent licensed professional engineer or similarly qualified individual. You must also include in the plan the method used to reduce total cooling pond footprint, the analyses used to determine and support the reduction in the total cooling pond surface area, and the amount of total cooling pond surface area that was reduced due to the facility specific evaluation plan.

(iv) For at least one gypsum dewatering stack that is considered part of your gypsum dewatering stack system, you may choose to minimize the surface area of the gypsum pond associated with the active gypsum dewatering stack by using a rim ditch (cell) building technique or other building technique.
