####### ยง 63.5714 How do I demonstrate compliance if I use filled resins?

(a) If you are using a filled production resin or filled tooling resin, you must demonstrate compliance for the filled material on an as-applied basis using equation 1 of this section.

(b) If the filled resin is used as a production resin and the value of PVcalculated by equation 1 of this section does not exceed 46 kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of filled resin applied, then the filled resin is in compliance.

(c) If the filled resin is used as a tooling resin and the value of PVcalculated by equation 1 of this section does not exceed 54 kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of filled resin applied, then the filled resin is in compliance.

(d) If you are including a filled resin in the emissions averaging procedure described in ยง 63.5710, then use the value of PVcalculated using equation 1 of this section for the value of PV i in equation 2 of ยง 63.5710.
