###### Federal Implementation Plan for Managing Emissions From Oil and Natural Gas Sources on the Indian Country Lands Within the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah
####### ยง 49.4178 VOC emissions control requirements for fugitive emissions.
######## Monitoring requirements.

(d)(1) Each owner or operator must develop and implement a fugitive emissions monitoring plan to reduce emissions from fugitive emissions components at all of their oil and natural gas sources on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation. This Reservation-wide monitoring plan must include the following elements, at a minimum:

(i) A requirement to perform an initial monitoring of the collection of fugitive emissions components at each oil and natural gas source by February 6, 2024;

(ii) A requirement to perform subsequent monitoring of the collection of fugitive emissions components at each oil and natural gas source once every 6 months after the initial monitoring survey, with consecutive monitoring surveys conducted at least 4 months apart and no more than 7 months apart.

(iii) A description of the technique used to identify leaking fugitive emission components, which must be limited to:

(A) Onsite EPA Reference Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, where an analyzer reading of 500 parts per million volume (ppmv) VOC or greater is considered a leak in need of repair;

(B) Onsite optical gas imaging instruments, as defined in 40 CFR 60.18(g)(4), where any visible emissions are considered a leak in need of repair, unless the owner or operator evaluates the leak with an analyzer meeting EPA Reference Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and the concentration is less than 500 ppmv. The optical gas imaging instrument must be capable of meeting the optical gas imaging equipment requirements specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOOa; or

(C) Another method approved by the Administrator to demonstrate compliance with the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements. To be approved, you must demonstrate that the alternative method achieves emissions reductions that equal or exceed those that would result from the application of either Method 21 or optical gas imaging instruments. Approval of an alternative method will be subject to public notice and comment.

(iv) The manufacturer and model number of any fugitive emissions monitoring device to be used;

(v) Procedures and timeframes for identifying and repairing components from which leaks are detected, including:

(A) A requirement to repair any leaks identified from components that are safe to repair and do not require source shutdown as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 calendar days after discovering the leak;
