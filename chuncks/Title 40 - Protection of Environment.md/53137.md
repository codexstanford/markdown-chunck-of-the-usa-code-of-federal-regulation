###### § 98.475 Procedures for estimating missing data.

A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG quantities calculations is required.

(a) Whenever the monitoring procedures for all facilities that used flow meters covered under this subpart cannot be followed to measure flow, the following missing data procedures must be followed:

(1) Another calculation methodology listed in § 98.474(a)(1) must be used if possible.

(2) If another method listed in § 98.474(a)(1) cannot be used, a quarterly flow rate value that is missing must be estimated using a representative flow rate value from the nearest previous time period.

(b) Whenever the monitoring procedures of this subpart cannot be followed to measure quarterly quantity of COreceived in containers, the most appropriate of the following missing data procedures must be followed:

(1) Another calculation methodology listed in § 98.474(a)(2) must be used if possible.

(2) If another method listed in § 98.474(a)(2) cannot be used, a quarterly mass or volume that is missing must be estimated using a representative mass or volume from the nearest previous time period.

(c) Whenever the monitoring procedures cannot be followed to measure COconcentration, the following missing data procedures must be followed:

(1) Another calculation methodology listed in § 98.474(a)(3) must be used if possible.

(2) If another method listed in § 98.474(a)(3) cannot be used, a quarterly concentration value that is missing must be estimated using a representative concentration value from the nearest previous time period.
