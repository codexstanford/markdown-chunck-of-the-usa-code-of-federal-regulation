(3) You must perform tank level measurements (if used to determine feedstock or product flows) according to one of the following methods. You may use any standard method published by a consensus-based standards organization or you may use an industry standard practice. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373,), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293-8020,), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824-7000,), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763,), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-4070, (202) 682-8000,) and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356-0060,).

(4) Beginning January 1, 2010, use any applicable methods specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section to determine the carbon content or composition of feedstocks and products and the average molecular weight of gaseous feedstocks and products. Calibrate instruments in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section, as applicable. For coal used as a feedstock, the samples for carbon content determinations shall be taken at a location that is representative of the coal feedstock used during the corresponding monthly period. For carbon black products, samples shall be taken of each grade or type of product produced during the monthly period. Samples of coal feedstock or carbon black product for carbon content determinations may be either grab samples collected and analyzed monthly or a composite of samples collected more frequently and analyzed monthly. Analyses conducted in accordance with methods specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (xv) of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, by an independent laboratory, by the supplier of a feedstock, or by a product customer.
