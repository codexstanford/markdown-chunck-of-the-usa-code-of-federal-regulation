###### Inversion breakup fumigation.

i.Inversion breakup fumigation occurs when a plume (or multiple plumes) is emitted into a stable layer of air and that layer is subsequently mixed to the ground through convective transfer of heat from the surface or because of advection to less stable surroundings. Fumigation may cause excessively high concentrations, but is usually rather short-lived at a given receptor. There are no recommended refined techniques to model this phenomenon. There are, however, screening proceduresthat may be used to approximate the concentrations. Considerable care should be exercised in using the results obtained from the screening techniques.
