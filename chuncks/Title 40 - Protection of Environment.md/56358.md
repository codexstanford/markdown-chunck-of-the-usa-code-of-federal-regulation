######## Cryptosporidium

During an onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of ยง 141.71(b)(3), the State must determine whether your watershed control program is adequate to limit potential contamination byoocysts. The adequacy of the program must be based on the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of your program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which your system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed.
