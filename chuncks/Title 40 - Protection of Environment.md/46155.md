####### Malfunction criteria for exhaust gas sensor heaters.

(vi)(A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the heater performance when the current or voltage drop in the heater circuit is no longer within the manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation (i.e., within the criteria required to be met by the component vendor for heater circuit performance at high mileage). The manufacturer may use other malfunction criteria for heater performance malfunctions. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate via data and/or an engineering evaluation that the monitor is reliable and robust.

(B) The OBD system must detect malfunctions of the heater circuit including open or short circuits that conflict with the commanded state of the heater (e.g., shorted to 12 Volts when commanded to 0 Volts (ground)).
