####### Concern criteria.

(b)EPA may determine that concern exists about a substance's health or environmental effects if EPA makes any one of the following findings:

(1)(i) The substance may cause carcinogenic effects because the substance:

(A) Has been shown by valid test data to cause carcinogenic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal.

(B) Has been shown to be a possible carcinogen based on the weight of the evidence in short-term tests indicative of the potential to cause carcinogenic effects.

(C) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another substance that has been shown by test data to cause carcinogenic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.

(D) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be metabolized in humans or transformed in the environment to a substance which may have the potential to cause carcinogenic effects under the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) of this section.

(ii) No substance may be regulated based on a finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless EPA has also made the finding under ยง 721.170(c)(2)(ii).

(2) The substance has been shown by valid test data to cause acutely toxic effects in at least one species of laboratory animal or is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another substance that has been shown by valid test data to cause acutely toxic effects in at least one species of laboratory animal, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.

(3) The substance may cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure because the substance:

(i) Has been shown by valid test data to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure.

(ii) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another chemical substance that has been shown by valid test data to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.

(iii) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be metabolized in humans or transformed in the environment to a substance which may have the potential to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects under the criteria in paragraph (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.

(iv) Has been shown to potentially cause developmentally toxic effects based on the weight of the evidence in short-term tests indicative of the potential to cause developmentally toxic effects.

(4) The substance may cause significant adverse environmental effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of release because the substance:

(i) Has been shown by valid test data to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release.

(ii) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another substance that has been shown by valid test data to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.

(iii) Has been determined, based on calculations using the substance's physical and chemical properties, to be potentially able to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release.

(iv) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be environmentally transformed to a substance which may have the potential to cause significant adverse environmental effects under the criteria in paragraph (b)(4) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.

(5) Concern exists about the health or environmental effects of one or more impurities or byproducts of the substance because the impurity or byproduct meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (b) (1) through (4) of this section and either:

(i) The impurity or byproduct is a new chemical substance and may be present in concentrations that could cause adverse health or environmental effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure or release.

(ii) Reasonably anticipated manufacture, processing, or use activities involving the substance for which a premanufacture notice has been submitted may result in significantly increased human exposure to or environmental release of the impurity or byproduct compared to exposure or release levels resulting from existing activities involving the impurity or byproduct.
