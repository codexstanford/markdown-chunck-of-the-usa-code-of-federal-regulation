###### § 57.302 Performance level of interim constant controls.
####### Improved performance.

(d)(1) The performance level representing maximum feasible efficiency for any existing control system (e.g., a sulfuric acid plant or a DMA scrubber) shall require the correction of the effects of any serious deficiencies in the system. For the purpose of this paragraph, at least the following problems shall constitute serious deficiencies in acid plants:

(i) Heat exchangers and associated equipment inadequate to sustain efficient, autothermal operation at the average gas strengths and volumes received by the acid plant during routine process equipment operation;

(ii) Failure to completely fill all available catalyst bed stages with sufficient catalyst;

(iii) Inability of the gas pre-treatment system to prevent unduly frequent plugging or fouling (deterioration) of catalyst or other components of the acid plant; or

(iv) Blower capacity inadequate to permit the treatment of the full volume of gas which the plant could otherwise accommodate, or in-leakage of air into the flues leading to the plant, to the extent that this inadequacy results in bypassing of gas around the plant.

(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of § 57.304(c) (malfunction demonstration), no excess emissions (as defined in § 57.304(a)) shall be considered to have resulted from a malfunction in the constant control system if the smelter owner has not upgraded serious deficiencies in the constant control system in compliance with the requirements of § 57.302(d)(1), unless the smelter owner demonstrates under § 57.304(c) that compliance with those requirements would not have affected the magnitude of the emission.
