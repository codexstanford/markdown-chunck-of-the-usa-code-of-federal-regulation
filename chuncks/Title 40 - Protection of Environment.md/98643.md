####### Evaluation and interpretation of results.

(2)(i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, such as a concentration-related, or a reproducible increase in mutant frequency. Biological relevance of the results should be considered first. Statistical methods may be used as an aid in evaluating the test results. Statistical significance should not be the only determining factor for a positive response.

(ii) A test substance, for which the results do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is considered non-mutagenic in this system.

(iii) Although most studies will give clearly positive or negative results, in rare cases the data set will preclude making a definite judgement about the activity of the test substance. Results may remain equivocal or questionable regardless of the number of times the experiment is repeated.
