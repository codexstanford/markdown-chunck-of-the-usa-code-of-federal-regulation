###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### § 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Compliance.

(6)The affected source is in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month if all operating parameters required to be monitored under paragraphs (o)(1) through (3) of this section were maintained at the values established under §§ 63.3350 and 63.3360 and one of the standards in paragraphs (o)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section were met. If operating parameter deviations occurred, the affected source is in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month if, assuming no control of emissions or by estimating the emissions using a control destruction efficiency curve for each 3-hour deviation period, one of the standards in paragraphs (6)(i) through (iv) of this section were met.

(i) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or

(ii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at a new affected source; or

(iii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source during the month is less than the calculated allowable organic HAP as determined using paragraph (m) of this section; or

(iv) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source was not more than 5 percent of the total mass of organic HAP applied for the month at an existing affected source and no more than 2 percent of the total mass of organic HAP applied for the month at a new affected source. The total mass of organic HAP applied by the affected source in the month must be determined using Equation 10.
