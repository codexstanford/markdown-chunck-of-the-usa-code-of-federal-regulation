####### 1,Purpose.

()To assess and evaluate the toxic characteristics of a substance, the determination of subacute toxicity should be carried out after initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute testing. The 14-day repeated dose oral study provides information on the health hazard likely to arise from repeated short-term exposure by the oral route over a very limited period of time. It has been designed to permit the determination of the no-observed-adverse-effect level and toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test substance for 14 days and to evaluate reversibility, persistence, and delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a 14-day follow-up recovery period. The test is not capable of determining those effects that have a long latency period for development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life shortening). It will provide information on target organs and the possibility of accumulation, and can be used in selecting dose levels for subchronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for short-term human exposure.
