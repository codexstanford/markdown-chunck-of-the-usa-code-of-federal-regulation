####### Notification of inspection.

(1)To provide the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days before an inspection required by §§ 63.1063(d)(1) or (d)(3). If an inspection is unplanned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance, then the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days before the inspection. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days before the inspection. If a delegated State or local agency is notified, the owner or operator is not required to notify the Administrator. A delegated State or local agency may waive the requirement for notification of inspections.
