####### Determination of material VHAP or HAP concentration to determine the applicability of the equipment leak standards under this subpart (ยง 63.769).

(a)Each piece of ancillary equipment and compressors are presumed to be in VHAP service or in wet gas service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in VHAP service or in wet gas service.

(1) For a piece of ancillary equipment and compressors to be considered not in VHAP service, it must be determined that the percent VHAP content can be reasonably expected never to exceed 10.0 percent by weight. For the purposes of determining the percent VHAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of ancillary equipment or compressor, you shall use the method in either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or

(ii) ASTM D6420-99 (2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference-see ยง 63.14), provided that the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section are followed:

(A) The target compound(s) are those listed in section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (2004);

(B) The target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 parts per million by volume;

(C) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (2004), but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, the additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99 (2004), is conducted, met, documented, and submitted with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the compound is not considered water soluble; and

(D) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (2004), and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, ASTM D6420-99 (2004) may not be used.

(2) For a piece of ancillary equipment and compressors to be considered in wet gas service, it must be determined that it contains or contacts the field gas before the extraction of natural gas liquids.
