####### Causes for modification or revocation and reissuance.

(b)The following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a permit:

(1) Cause exists for termination under § 144.40, and the Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is appropriate.

(2) The Director has received notification (as required in the permit, see § 144.41(d)) of a proposed transfer of the permit. A permit also may be modified to reflect a transfer after the effective date of an automatic transfer (§ 144.38(b)) but will not be revoked and reissued after the effective date of the transfer except upon the request of the new permittee.

(3) A determination that the waste being injected is a hazardous waste as defined in § 261.3 either because the definition has been revised, or because a previous determination has been changed.
