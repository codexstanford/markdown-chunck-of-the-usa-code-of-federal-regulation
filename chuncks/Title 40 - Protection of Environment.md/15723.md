######## Test procedure.

(2)(i) For each of the three test samplers and each of the 10 test days of the precision test, record each measured flow rate as F, where i is the sampler number, j is the test day, and t is the time of flow rate measurement (t = 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours).

(ii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record the average flow rate as:

(iii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record the percent difference between the average flow rate and the initial flow rate as:

(iv) For each sampler and for each of the 3 test days on which flow measurements were obtained at 6-hour intervals throughout the 24-hour sampling period, calculate and record the percent differences between each measured flow rate and the initial flow rate as:

(v) The candidate method passes the flow rate stability test if all of the Δ Fand Δ Fvalues meet the specifications in table D-1.
