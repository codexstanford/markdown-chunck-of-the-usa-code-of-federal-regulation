###### ยง 1066.255 Parasitic loss verification.
####### Performance evaluation.

(d)Some dynamometers automatically update the parasitic loss curve for further testing. If this is not the case, compare the new parasitic loss curve to the original parasitic loss curve from the dynamometer manufacturer or the most recent parasitic loss curve you programmed into the dynamometer. You may reprogram the dynamometer to accept the new curve in all cases, and you must reprogram the dynamometer if any point on the new curve departs from the earlier curve by more than +/-9.0 N (+/-2.0 lbf) for dynamometers capable of testing vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR, or +/-36.0 N (+/-8.0 lbf) for dynamometers not capable of testing vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR.
