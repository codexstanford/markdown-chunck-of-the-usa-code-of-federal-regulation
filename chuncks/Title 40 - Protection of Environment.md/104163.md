###### ยง 1068.410 How must I select and prepare my engines/equipment?
####### Damage during shipment.

(g)If shipping the engine/equipment to a remote facility for testing under a selective enforcement audit makes necessary an adjustment or repair, you must wait until after the initial emission test to do this work. We may waive this requirement if the test would be impossible or unsafe or if it would permanently damage the engine/equipment. Report to us, in your written report under ยง 1068.450, all adjustments or repairs you make on test engines/equipment before each test.
