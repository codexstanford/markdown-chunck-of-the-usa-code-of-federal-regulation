###### ยง 63.1650 Applicability and compliance dates.

(a) This subpart applies to all new and existing ferromanganese and silicomanganese production facilities that manufacture ferromanganese or silicomanganese and are major sources or are co-located at major sources of hazardous air pollutant emissions.

(b) The following sources at a ferromanganese and silicomanganese production facility are subject to this subpart:

(1) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input of 22 MW or less when producing ferromanganese.

(2) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input greater than 22 MW when producing ferromanganese.

(3) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input greater than 25 MW when producing silicomanganese.

(4) Open submerged arc furnaces with a furnace power input of 25 MW or less when producing silicomanganese.

(5) Semi-sealed submerged arc furnaces when producing ferromanganese.

(6) Metal oxygen refining (MOR) process.

(7) Crushing and screening operations.

(8) Fugitive dust sources.

(c) A new affected source is one for which construction or reconstruction commenced after August 4, 1998.
