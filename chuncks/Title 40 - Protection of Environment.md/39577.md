(i) The date, place, and time of each inspection;

(ii) Person performing the inspection;

(iii) Results of the inspection, including the date, time, and duration of the corrective action period from the time the inspection indicated a problem to the time of the indication that the device was replaced or restored to operation.

(4) If you own or operate a new source that is subject to § 63.11621(e), you must keep the records in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) If you demonstrate that the cyclone is designed to reduce emission of particulate matter by 95 percent or greater by manufacturer's specifications in accordance with § 63.11621(e)(1(i), you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.

(A) Information from the manufacturer regarding the design efficiency of the cyclone,

(B) The inlet flow rate, inlet velocity, pressure drop, or fan amperage range that represents proper operation of the cyclone,

(C) The operation and maintenance procedures to ensure proper operation of the cyclone.

(ii) If you demonstrate that the cyclone is designed to reduce emissions of particulate matter by 95 percent or greater by certification by a professional engineer in accordance with paragraph § 63.11621(e)(1)(ii), you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.

(A) Certification regarding the design efficiency of the cyclone, along with supporting information,

(B) The inlet flow rate, inlet velocity, pressure drop, or fan amperage range that represents proper operation of the cyclone,

(C) The standard maintenance and operating procedures that ensure proper operation of the cyclone.

(iii) If you demonstrate that the cyclone is designed to reduce emissions of particulate matter by 95 percent or greater by a performance in accordance with paragraph § 63.11621(e)(1)(iii), you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.

(A) Results of the testing conducted in accordance with § 63.11623,

(C) Results of the inspection, including the date, time, and duration of the corrective action period from the time the inspection indicated a problem to the time of the indication that the cyclone was restored to proper operation.

(v) Records of the daily inlet flow rate, inlet velocity, pressure drop, or fan amperage measurements, along with the date, time, and duration of the correction action period from the time the monitoring indicated a problem to the time of the indication that the cyclone was restored to proper operation.

(5) If you own or operate an existing source that is subject to § 63.11621(f), you must keep the records in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.
