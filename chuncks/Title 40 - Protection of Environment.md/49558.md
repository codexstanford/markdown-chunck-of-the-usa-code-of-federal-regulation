####### ยง 97.143 Compliance supplement pool.

(a) In addition to the CAIR NOallowances allocated under ยง 97.142, the Administrator may allocate for the control period in 2009 up to the following amount of CAIR NOallowances to CAIR NOunits in the respective State:

(b) For any CAIR NOunit in a State, if the unit's average annual NOemission rate for 2007 or 2008 is less than 0.25 lb/mmBtu and, where such unit is included in a NOaveraging plan under ยง 76.11 of this chapter under the Acid Rain Program for such year, the unit's NOaveraging plan has an actual weighted average NOemission rate for such year equal to or less than the actual weighted average NOemission rate for the year before such year and if the unit achieves NOemission reductions in 2007 and 2008, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR NOallowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in accordance with the following:

(1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NOunit shall monitor and report the NOemissions rate and the heat input of the unit in accordance with subpart HH of this part in each control period for which early reduction credit is requested.

(2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NOunit shall submit to the Administrator by May 1, 2009 a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NOallowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the sum of the unit's heat input for the control period in 2007 multiplied by the difference (if any greater than zero) between 0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's NOemission rate for the control period in 2007 plus the unit's heat input for the control period in 2008 multiplied by the difference (if any greater than zero) between 0.25 lb/mmBtu and the unit's NOemission rate for the control period in 2008, determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part and with the sum divided by 2,000 lb/ton and rounded to the nearest whole number of tons as appropriate.

(c) For any CAIR NOunit in a State whose compliance with the CAIR NOemissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NOallowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the following:

(1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NOunit shall submit to the Administrator by May 1, 2009 a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NOallowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NOallowances necessary to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply.

(2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NOunit shall demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount of CAIR NOallowances requested, the unit's compliance with the CAIR NOemissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit to:

(i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electricity from other electricity generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at the unit for compliance with the CAIR NOemissions limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or

(ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NOallowances to prevent such undue risk.

(d) The Administrator will review each request under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009 and will allocate CAIR NOallowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR NOunits in a State and covered by such request as follows:

(1) Upon receipt of each such request, the Administrator will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of the CAIR NOallowances requested meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

(2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has an amount of CAIR NOallowances not less than the total amount of CAIR NOallowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOunit covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NOallowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section).

(3) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NOallowances than the total amount of CAIR NOallowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the Administrator will allocate CAIR NOallowances to each CAIR NOunit covered by such requests according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate:

(4) By July 31, 2009, the Administrator will determine by order the allocations under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. The Administrator will make available to the public each determination of CAIR NOallowances under such paragraph and will provide an opportunity for submission of objections to the determination. Objections shall be limited to addressing whether the determination is in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, as appropriate. Based on any such objections, the Administrator will adjust each determination to the extent necessary to ensure that it is in accordance with such paragraphs.

(5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will record the allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
