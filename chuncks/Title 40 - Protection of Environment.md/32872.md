####### ยง 63.1564 What are my requirements for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units?
######## How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards?

(c)You must:

(1) Demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limitation in Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in Tables 6 and 7 of this subpart.

(2) Demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standard in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by maintaining records to document conformance with the procedures in your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(3) If you use a continuous opacity monitoring system and elect to comply with Option 3 in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, determine continuous compliance with your site-specific Ni operating limit by using Equation 11 of this section as follows:

(4) If you use a continuous opacity monitoring system and elect to comply with Option 4 in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, determine continuous compliance with your site-specific Ni operating limit by using Equation 12 of this section as follows:

(5) If you elect to comply with the alternative limit in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section during periods of startup, shutdown and hot standby, demonstrate continuous compliance on or before the date specified in ยง 63.1563(d) by:

(i) Collecting the volumetric flow rate from the catalyst regenerator (in acfm) and determining the average flow rate for each hour. For events lasting less than one hour, determine the average flow rate during the event.

(ii) Determining the cumulative cross-sectional area of the primary internal cyclone inlets in square feet (ft) using design drawings of the primary (first-stage) internal cyclones to determine the inlet cross-sectional area of each primary internal cyclone and summing the cross-sectional areas for all primary internal cyclones in the catalyst regenerator or, if primary cyclones. If all primary internal cyclones are identical, you may alternatively determine the inlet cross-sectional area of one primary internal cyclone using design drawings and multiply that area by the total number of primary internal cyclones in the catalyst regenerator.

(iii) Calculating the inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones in feet per second (ft/sec) by dividing the average volumetric flow rate (acfm) by the cumulative cross-sectional area of the primary internal cyclone inlets (ft) and by 60 seconds/minute (for unit conversion).

(iv) Maintaining the inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones at or above 20 feet per second for each hour during the startup, shutdown, or hot standby event or, for events lasting less than 1 hour, for the duration of the event.
