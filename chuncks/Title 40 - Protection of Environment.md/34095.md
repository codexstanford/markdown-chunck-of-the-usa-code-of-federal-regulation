######## e.g.,

(2) If you have data indicating the actual performance of a capture system or add-on control device (capture efficiency measured at a reduced flow rate or add-on control device efficiency measured at a reduced thermal oxidizer temperature) during a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation, then these data may be used to support and document your request to use these values for that period of deviation.

(3) The organic HAP emission reduction achieved during each period of deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or add-on control device serving a controlled coating operation for which the Administrator has approved the use of non-zero capture efficiency and add-on control device efficiency values is calculated using Equation 8 of this section.

(4) Calculate the total mass of organic HAP in the coatings used in the controlled coating operation during the period of deviation using equation 8A of this section:

(5) Calculate the total mass of organic HAP in the thinners used in the controlled coating operation during the period of deviation using equation 8B of this section:
