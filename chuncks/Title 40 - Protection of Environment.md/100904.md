##### Subpart B - Emission Standards and Related Requirements
###### § 1042.101 Exhaust emission standards for Category 1 and Category 2 engines.
####### Not-to-exceed standards.

(c)Except as noted in § 1042.145(e), exhaust emissions from all engines subject to the requirements of this part may not exceed the not-to-exceed (NTE) standards as follows:

(1) Use the following equation to determine the NTE standards:

(ii) Round each NTE standard to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.

(2) Determine the applicable NTE zone and subzones as described in § 1042.515. Determine NTE multipliers for specific zones and subzones and pollutants as follows:

(i) For marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), except for variable-speed propulsion marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, apply the following NTE multipliers:

(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.

(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NOand HC standards and for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards.

(ii) For recreational marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(2), except for variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, apply the following NTE multipliers:

(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 3 PM and CO standards.

(C) Subzones 2 and 3: 1.5 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(D) Subzones 2 and 3: 1.9 for PM and CO standards.

(iii) For variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers that are certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), (2), or (3), apply the following NTE multipliers:

(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.

(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NOand HC standards and for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard in Subzone 2b for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.

(iv) For constant-speed engines certified using a duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(3) or (4), apply the following NTE multipliers:

(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.

(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NOand HC standards and for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.

(v) For variable-speed auxiliary marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(5)(ii) or (iii):

(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.

(C) Subzone 2: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO+HC standards.

(D) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.

(3) The NTE standards apply to your engines whenever they operate within the NTE zone for an NTE sampling period of at least thirty seconds, during which only a single operator demand set point may be selected. Engine operation during a change in operator demand is excluded from any NTE sampling period. There is no maximum NTE sampling period.

(4) Collect emission data for determining compliance with the NTE standards using the procedures described in subpart F of this part.

(5) You may ask us to accept as compliant an engine that does not fully meet specific requirements under the applicable NTE standards where such deficiencies are necessary for safety.
