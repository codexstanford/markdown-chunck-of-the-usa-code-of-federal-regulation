######### Procedure.
########## Measurement principles.

(b)A chiller removes HO, which can otherwise interfere with a NOmeasurement. However, liquid HO remaining in an improperly designed chiller can remove NOfrom the sample. If a chiller is used without an NO-to-NO converter upstream, it could remove NOfrom the sample prior NOmeasurement.
