####### Mass of previously produced fluorinated GHGs fed into destruction device.

(h)You must measure the mass of each fluorinated GHG that is fed into the destruction device in more than trace concentrations and that was previously produced as defined at ยง 98.410(b). Such fluorinated GHGs include but are not limited to quantities that are shipped to the facility by another facility for destruction and quantities that are returned to the facility for reclamation but are found to be irretrievably contaminated and are therefore destroyed. You must use flowmeters, weigh scales, or a combination of volumetric and density measurements with an accuracy and precision of +/-1 percent of full scale or better. If the measured mass includes more than trace concentrations of materials other than the fluorinated GHG being destroyed, you must measure the concentration of the fluorinated GHG being destroyed. You must multiply this concentration (mass fraction) by the mass measurement to obtain the mass of the fluorinated GHG fed into the destruction device.
