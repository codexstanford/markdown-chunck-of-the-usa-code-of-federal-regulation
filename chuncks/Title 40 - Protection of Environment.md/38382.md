####### Hg Emissions Records (Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems).

7.1.4For each affected unit or common stack using a sorbent trap monitoring system, each owner or operator shall record the following information for the unit or stack operating hour in each data collection period:

7.1.4.1 The date and hour;

7.1.4.2 Monitoring system and component identification codes, as provided in the monitoring plan, if the sorbent trap system provides a quality-assured value of Hg concentration for the hour;

7.1.4.3 The hourly Hg concentration, if a quality-assured value is obtained for the hour (µg/scm, with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation). Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged. Note that when a single quality-assured Hg concentration value is obtained for a particular data collection period, that single concentration value is applied to each operating hour of the data collection period.

7.1.4.4 A special code, indicating whether or not a quality-assured Hg concentration is obtained for the hour;

7.1.4.5 The average flow rate of stack gas through each sorbent trap (in appropriate units, e.g., liters/min, cc/min, dscm/min);

7.1.4.6 The gas flow meter reading (in dscm, rounded to the nearest hundredth), at the beginning and end of the collection period and at least once in each unit operating hour during the collection period;

7.1.4.7 The ratio of the stack gas flow rate to the sample flow rate, as described in section 12.2 of Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter; and

7.1.4.8 Monitor data availability, as a percentage of unit or stack operating hours, calculated according to § 75.32 of this chapter.
