####### Considerations regarding uncertainty and variability.

(1)Information about uncertainty and variability in each step of the risk evaluation (e.g., use of default assumptions, scenarios, choice of models, and information used for quantitative analysis) will be integrated into an overall characterization and/or analysis of the impact of the uncertainty and variability on estimated risks. EPA may describe the uncertainty using a qualitative assessment of the overall strength and limitations of the data used in the assessment.
