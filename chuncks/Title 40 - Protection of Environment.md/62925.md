####### Portable air compressor operation.

(d)The portable air compressor must be operated at the design full speed with the compressor on load, delivering its rated flow and output pressure, during noise emission standard compliance testing. The air discharge shall be provided with a resistive loading such that no significant pressure drop or throttling occurs across the compressor discharge valve. The air discharge shall be piped clear of the test area or fed into an effective silencer. The sound pressure level due to the air discharge shall be at least 10 dB below the sound pressure level generated by the portable air compressor.
