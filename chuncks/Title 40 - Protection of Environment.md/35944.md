####### ยง 63.5758 How do I determine the organic HAP content of materials?
######## Solvent blends.

(6)Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some regulated materials in certifications provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP content of the materials. When detailed organic HAP content data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the values for organic HAP content that are listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart. You may use Table 6 to this subpart only if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 5 to this subpart and you know only whether the blend is either aliphatic or aromatic. However, if test results indicate higher values than those listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart, then the test results must be used for determining compliance.
