###### Calibration Gases.,i.e.

7.2The calibration gases for the gas analyzer shall be propane in air or propane in nitrogen. If organic compounds other than propane are used, the appropriate corrections for response factor must be available and applied to the results. Calibration gases shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure listed in Citation 2 of section 16. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder must provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than +/-2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally available (, organics between 1 and 10 percent by volume), alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems (Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M), may be used with prior approval of the Administrator.
