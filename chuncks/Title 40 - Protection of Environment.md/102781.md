######## Measurement principles.

(b)Water can inhibit an analyzer's ability to properly measure the exhaust component of interest and thus is sometimes removed before the sample gas reaches the analyzer. For example water can negatively interfere with a CLD's NOresponse through collisional quenching and can positively interfere with an NDIR analyzer by causing a response similar to CO.
