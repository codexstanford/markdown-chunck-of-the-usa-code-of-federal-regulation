####### Hazard evaluation.

(4)The response plan shall discuss the facility's known or reasonably identifiable history of discharges reportable under 40 CFR part 110 for the entire life of the facility and shall identify areas within the facility where discharges could occur and what the potential effects of the discharges would be on the affected environment. To assess the range of areas potentially affected, owners or operators shall, where appropriate, consider the distance calculated in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section to determine whether a facility could, because of its location, reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.
