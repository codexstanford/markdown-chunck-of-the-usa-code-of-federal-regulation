####### ยง 53.63 Test procedure: Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.
######## Overview.

(a)This test applies to a candidate sampler which differs from the reference method sampler only with respect to the design of the inlet. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the aspiration of a Class II candidate sampler is such that it representatively extracts an ambient aerosol at elevated wind speeds. This wind tunnel test uses a single-sized, liquid aerosol in conjunction with wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The test atmosphere concentration is alternately measured with the candidate sampler and a reference method device, both of which are operated without the 2.5-micron fractionation device installed. The test conditions are summarized in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading of "wind tunnel inlet aspiration test"). The candidate sampler must meet or exceed the acceptance criteria given in table F-1 of this subpart.
