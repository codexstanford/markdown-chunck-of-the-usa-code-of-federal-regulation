####### i.e.,

(iii) During decoking operations, continuously monitor the temperature at the radiant tube(s) outlet when air is being introduced to ensure the coke combustion occurring inside the radiant tube(s) is not so aggressive (too hot) that it damages either the radiant tube(s) or ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s). The owner or operator must immediately initiate procedures to reduce the temperature at the radiant tube(s) outlet once the temperature reaches a level that indicates combustion of coke inside the radiant tube(s) is too aggressive.

(iv) After decoking, but before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations, verify that decoke air is no longer being added.

(v) After decoking, but before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations and/or during normal operations, inject materials into the steam or feed to reduce coke formation inside the radiant tube(s) during normal operation.
