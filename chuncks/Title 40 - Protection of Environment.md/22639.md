###### Sampling Strategy.

6.2.1Conduct the CD test at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two daily concentration levels specified in section 4.3. Introduce the two calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas must pass through all CEM components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences may exceed 3 percent of the span of the CEM.
