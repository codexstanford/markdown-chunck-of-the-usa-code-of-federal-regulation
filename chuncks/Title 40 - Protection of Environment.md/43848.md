###### ยง 80.1426 How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel?
####### Renewable fuel that can be described by two or more pathways.

(3)(i) The D codes that shall be used in the RINs generated by a producer or importer whose renewable fuel can be described by two or more pathways shall be the D codes specified in Table 1 to this section, or D codes as approved by the Administrator, which correspond to the pathways that describe the renewable fuel throughout that calendar year.

(ii) If all the pathways describing the producer's operations have the same D code and each batch is of a single fuel type, then that D code shall be used in all the RINs generated and the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel shall be equal to a volume calculated according to the following formula:

(iii) If all the pathways describing the producer's operations have the same D code but individual batches are comprised of a mixture of fuel types with different equivalence values, then that D code shall be used in all the RINs generated and the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel shall be equal to a volume calculated according to the following formula:

(iv) If the pathway applicable to a producer changes on a specific date, such that one pathway applies before the date and another pathway applies on and after the date, and each batch is of a single fuel type, then the applicable D code and batch identifier used in generating RINs must change on the date that the change in pathway occurs and the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel shall be equal to a volume calculated according to the following formula:

(v) If a producer produces batches that are comprised of a mixture of fuel types with different equivalence values and different applicable D codes, then separate values for Vshall be calculated for each category of renewable fuel according to formulas in Table 3 to this section. All batch-RINs thus generated shall be assigned to unique batch identifiers for each portion of the batch with a different D code.

(vi)(A) If a producer produces a single type of renewable fuel using two or more different feedstocks or biointermediates which are processed simultaneously, and each batch is comprised of a single type of fuel, then the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a batch of renewable fuel and assigned a particular D code shall be determined according to the formulas in Table 4 to this section.

(B) Feedstock energy values, FE, shall be calculated according to the following formula:
