###### FTIR System.

3.1.1Instrument to measure spectra in the mid-infrared spectral region (500 to 4000 cm). It contains an infrared source, interferometer, sample gas containment cell, infrared detector, and computer. The interferometer consists of a beam splitter that divides the beam into two paths, one path a fixed distance and the other a variable distance. The computer is equipped with software to run the interferometer and store the raw digitized signal from the detector (interferogram). The software performs the mathematical conversion (the Fourier transform) of the interferogram into a spectrum showing the frequency dependent sample absorbance. All spectral data can be stored on computer media.
