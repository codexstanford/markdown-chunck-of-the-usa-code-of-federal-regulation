######## Sorbent spiking.

(c)Use good engineering judgment to verify the extent to which your extraction methods recover SVOCs absorbed on the sample media. We recommend spiking the XAD-2 resin with a surrogate standard before testing with a carbon-13 or hydrogen-2 isotopically labeled standard for each of the class of analytes targeted for analysis. Perform this spiking as follows:

(1) Insert the lower PUF plug into the bottom of the sorbent module.

(2) Add half of one portion of XAD-2 resin to the module and spike the XAD-2 in the module with the standard.

(3) Wait 1 hour for the solvent from the standard(s) to evaporate, add the remaining 20 g of the XAD-2 resin to the module, and then insert a PUF plug in the top of the sorbent module.

(4) Cover the inlet and outlet of the sorbent module with pre-cleaned aluminum foil.
