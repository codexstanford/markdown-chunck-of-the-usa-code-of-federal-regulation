####### VOC used

means the amount of VOC delivered to the coating mix preparation equipment of the affected facility (including any contained in premixed coatings or other coating ingredients prepared off the plant site) for the formulation of polymeric coatings to be applied to supporting substrates at the coating operation, plus any solvent added after initial formulation is complete (e.g., dilution solvent added at the coating operation). If premixed coatings that require no mixing at the plant site are used, "VOC used" means the amount of VOC delivered to the coating applicator(s) of the affected facility.
