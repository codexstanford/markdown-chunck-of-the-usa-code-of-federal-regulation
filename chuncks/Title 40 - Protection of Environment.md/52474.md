####### Methods for continuous measurement from individual reciprocating compressor sources.

(3)If you elect to conduct continuous volumetric emission measurements for an individual compressor source as specified in paragraph (p)(1)(ii) of this section, you must measure volumetric emissions as specified in paragraphs (p)(3)(i) and (p)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) Continuously measure the volumetric flow for the individual compressor sources at standard conditions using a permanent meter according to methods set forth in ยง 98.234(b).

(ii) If compressor blowdown emissions are included in the metered emissions specified in paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section, the compressor blowdown emissions may be included with the reported emissions for the compressor source and do not need to be calculated separately using the method specified in paragraph (i) of this section for blowdown vent stacks.
