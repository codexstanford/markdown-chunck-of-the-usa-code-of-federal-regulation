######## Testing of representative emission units.

(f)With the prior approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, an owner or operator may utilize emission rates obtained by testing a particular type of group 1 furnace that does not have an add-on air pollution control device, or by testing an in-line flux box that does not have an add-on air pollution control device, to determine the emission rate for other units of the same type at the same facility. Such emission test results may only be considered to be representative of other units if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

(1) The tested emission unit must use feed materials and charge rates which are comparable to the emission units that it represents;

(2) The tested emission unit must use the same type of flux materials in the same proportions as the emission units it represents;

(3) The tested emission unit must be operated utilizing the same work practices as the emission units that it represents;

(4) The tested emission unit must be of the same design as the emission units that it represents; and

(5) The tested emission unit must be tested under the highest load or capacity reasonably expected to occur for any of the emission units that it represents.

(6) All 3 separate runs of a performance test must be conducted on the same emission unit.
