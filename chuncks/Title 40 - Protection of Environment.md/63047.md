####### Measurements.

(3)(i) The meter shall be set for "fast response" and the A-weighted network.

(ii) The meter shall be observed during the period while the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating. The applicable reading shall be the highest sound level obtained for the run. The observer is cautioned to rerun the test if unrelated peaks should occur due to extraneous ambient noises. Readings shall be taken on both sides of the vehicle.

(iii) The sound level associated with a side shall be the average of the first two pass-by measurements for that side, if they are within 2 dB(A) of each other. Average of measurements on each side shall be computed separately. If the first two measurements for a given side differ by more than 2 dB(A), two additional measurements shall be made on each side, and the average of the two highest measurements on each side, within 2 dB(A) of each other, shall be taken as the measured vehicle sound level for that side. The reported vehicle sound level shall be the higher of the two averages.
