4.6.4Samples are immediately logged into the laboratory, where they will be given a unique sample identification based on Julian data and the number logged in. Prior to the analysis of any experimental samples, a five-point standard curve is prepared. One of the mid-range standard curve concentration levels is analyzed daily before sample analysis as a continuing standard. RRFs for all target analytesbe within 25% of the standard curve response values at day 0, and at any sampling event the check standard percent difference from the initial five-point calibration must not exceed 20% between the before and after daily standard mix (see below). The collected GC/MS data are initially processed by a macro routine, which performs extracted chromatographic plots of the target compounds, integrates the target compounds, and shows integration results to include tabular numbers. The integration values are then transferred to a spreadsheet format to be quantified. Because of the complexity of the analyte matrix (oil), a very high degree of manual verification and reintegration of the spectral data is required.
