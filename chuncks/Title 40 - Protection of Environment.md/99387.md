####### In-use testing.

(d)Locomotives containing your components must be tested according to the provisions of this paragraph (d).

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, you must test at least one locomotive if 250 locomotives use your component under this section. You must test one additional locomotive for the next additional 500 locomotives that use your component under this section. After that, we may require you to test one additional locomotive for each additional 1000 locomotives that use your component under this section. These numbers apply across model years. For example, if your component is used in 125 remanufactures per year under this section, you must test one of the first 250 locomotives, one of the next 500 locomotives, and up to one every eight years after that. Do not count locomotives that use your components but are not covered by this section.

(2) Except for the first locomotive you test for a specific component under this section, locomotives tested under this paragraph (d) must be past the half-way point of the useful life in terms of MW-hrs. For the first locomotive you test, select a locomotive that has operated between 25 and 50 percent of its useful life.

(3) Unless we approve a different schedule, you must complete testing and report the results to us within 180 days of the earliest point at which you could complete the testing based on the hours of operation accumulated by the locomotives. For example, if 250 or more locomotives use your part under this section, and the first of these to reach 25 percent of its useful life does so on March 1st of a given year, you must complete testing of one of the first 250 locomotives and report to us by August 28th of that year.

(4) Unless we approve different test procedures, you must test the locomotive according to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part.

(5) If any locomotives fail to meet all standards, we may require you to test one additional locomotive for each locomotive that fails. You may choose to accept that your part is causing an emission problem rather than continuing testing. You may also test additional locomotives at any time. We will consider failure rates, average emission levels and the existence of any defects among other factors in determining whether to pursue remedial action. We may order a recall pursuant to 40 CFR part 1068 before you complete testing additional locomotives.

(6) You may ask us to allow you to rely on testing performed by others instead of requiring you to perform testing. For example, if a railroad tests a locomotive with your component as part of its testing under ยง 1033.810, you may ask to submit those test data as fulfillment of your test obligations under this paragraph (d). If a given test locomotive uses different components certified under this section that were manufactured by different manufacturers (such as rings from one manufacturer and cylinder liners from another manufacturer), a single test of it may be counted towards both manufacturers' test obligations. In unusual circumstances, you may also ask us to grant you hardship relief from the testing requirements of this paragraph (d). In determining whether to grant you relief, we will consider all relevant factors including the extent of the financial hardship to your company and whether the test data are available from other sources, such as testing performed by a railroad.

(e) Components certified under this section may be used when remanufacturing Category 2 engines under 40 CFR part 1042.
