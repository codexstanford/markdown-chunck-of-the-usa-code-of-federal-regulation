####### Initial certification and recertification testing.

(1)The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for initial certification and recertification of an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part.

(i) When the optional SOmass emissions estimation procedure in appendix D to this part or the optional NOemissions estimation protocol in appendix E to this part is used, the owner or operator shall provide data from a flowmeter accuracy test (or shall provide a statement of calibration if the flowmeter meets the accuracy standard by design) for each fuel flowmeter, according to section 2.1.5.1 of appendix D to this part. For orifice, nozzle, and venturi-type flowmeters, the results of primary element visual inspections and/or calibrations of the transmitters or transducers shall also be provided.

(ii) For the automated data acquisition and handling system used under either the optional SOmass emissions estimation procedure in appendix D of this part or the optional NOemissions estimation protocol in appendix E of this part, the owner or operator shall perform tests designed to verify:

(A) The proper computation of hourly averages for pollutant concentrations, fuel flow rates, emission rates, heat input, and pollutant mass emissions; and

(B) Proper computation and application of the missing data substitution procedures in appendix D or E of this part.

(iii) When the optional NOemissions protocol in appendix E is used, the owner or operator shall complete all initial performance testing under section 2.1 of appendix E.
