####### Sample pumps.

(3)You may use sample pumps upstream of an analyzer or storage medium for any gas. Use sample pumps with inside surfaces of 300 series stainless steel, PTFE, or any other material that you demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling. For some sample pumps, you must control temperatures, as follows:

(i) If you use a NOsample pump upstream of either an NO-to-NO converter that meets ยง 1065.378 or a chiller that meets ยง 1065.376, design the sampling system to prevent aqueous condensation.

(ii) For testing compression-ignition engines, two-stroke spark-ignition engines, or four-stroke spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW, if you use a THC sample pump upstream of a THC analyzer or storage medium, its inner surfaces must be heated to a tolerance of (191 +/-11) &#xB0;C.
