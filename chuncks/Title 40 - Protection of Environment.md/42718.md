(ii)(A) A schematic diagram identifying the relationship between the unit, all fuel supply lines, the fuel flowmeter(s), and the stack(s). The schematic diagram must depict the installation location of each fuel flowmeter and the fuel sampling location(s). Comprehensive and/or separate schematic diagrams shall be used to describe groups of units using a common pipe;

(B) For units using the optional default SOemission rate for "pipeline natural gas" or "natural gas" in appendix D to this part, the information on the sulfur content of the gaseous fuel used to demonstrate compliance with either section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to this part;

(C) For units using the 720 hour test under 2.3.6 of Appendix D of this part to determine the required sulfur sampling requirements, report the procedures and results of the test; and

(D) For units using the 720 hour test under 2.3.5 of Appendix D of this part to determine the appropriate fuel GCV sampling frequency, report the procedures used and the results of the test.

(2) For each gas-fired peaking unit and oil-fired peaking unit for which the owner or operator uses the optional procedures in appendix E to this part for estimating NOemission rate, the designated representative shall include in the monitoring plan:
