###### ยง 1065.643 Carbon balance error verification calculations.

This section describes how to calculate quantities used in the carbon balance error verification described in ยง 1065.543. Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section describe how to calculate the mass of carbon for a test interval from carbon-carrying fluid streams, intake air into the system, and exhaust emissions, respectively. Paragraph (d) of this section describes how to use these carbon masses to calculate four different quantities for evaluating carbon balance error. Use rectangular or trapezoidal integration methods to calculate masses and amounts over a test interval from continuously measured or calculated mass and molar flow rates.
