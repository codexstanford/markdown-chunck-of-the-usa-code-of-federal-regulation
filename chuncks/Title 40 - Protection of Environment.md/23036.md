(a)The concentration of vinyl chloride in each exhaust gas stream from any equipment used in ethylene dichloride purification is not to exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), except as provided in ยง 61.65(a). This requirement does not preclude combining of exhaust gas streams provided the combined steam is ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm, or equivalent as provided in ยง 61.66. This requirement does not apply to equipment that has been opened, is out of operation, and met the requirement in ยง 61.65(b)(6)(i) before being opened.
