######## Technical definitions.

(b)(1) Sample flow rate means the quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the inlet.

(2) The flow rate cut-off function requires the sampler to automatically stop sample flow and terminate the current sample collection if the sample flow rate deviates by more than the variation limits specified in table E-1 of this subpart (+/-10 percent from the nominal sample flow rate) for more than 60 seconds during a sample collection period. The sampler is also required to properly notify the operator with a flag warning indication of the out-of-specification flow rate condition and if the flow rate cut-off results in an elapsed sample collection time of less than 23 hours.
