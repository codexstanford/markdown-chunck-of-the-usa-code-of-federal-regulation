Connections to the inlet teflon tubing (in O.D.) and to the outlet stainless steel tubing (in O.D.) shall be made by means of stainless steel fittings with teflon ferrules. The column is enclosed in a water jacket for temperature control as shown in the following figure 2:

(B) Constant temperature bath with circulation pump-bath and capable of controlling temperature to +/-0.05 &#xB0;C, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(C) HPLC equipped with a variable wavelenth UV absorption detector operating at a suitable wavelength and a recording integrator in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

(D) Extractor column-6.6 x 0.6 cm stainless steel tube with end fittings containing 5 µm frits filled with a superficially porous phase packing (Bondapack C/Corasil: Waters Associates) in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
