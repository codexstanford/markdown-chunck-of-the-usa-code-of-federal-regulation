###### ยง 93.119 Criteria and procedures: Interim emissions in areas without motor vehicle emissions budgets.
####### Ozone areas.

(b)The requirements of this paragraph apply to all ozone NAAQS areas, except for certain requirements as indicated. This criterion may be met:

(1) In moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to the reasonable further progress requirements of CAA section 182(b)(1) if a regional emissions analysis that satisfies the requirements of ยง 93.122 and paragraphs (g) through (j) of this section demonstrates that for each analysis year and for each of the pollutants described in paragraph (f) of this section:

(i) The emissions predicted in the "Action" scenario are less than the emissions predicted in the "Baseline" scenario, and this can be reasonably expected to be true in the periods between the analysis years; and

(ii) The emissions predicted in the "Action" scenario are lower than emissions in the baseline year for that NAAQS as described in paragraph (e) of this section by any nonzero amount.

(2) In marginal and below ozone nonattainment areas and other ozone nonattainment areas that are not subject to the reasonable further progress requirements of CAA section 182(b)(1) if a regional emissions analysis that satisfies the requirements of ยง 93.122 and paragraphs (g) through (j) of this section demonstrates that for each analysis year and for each of the pollutants described in paragraph (f) of this section:

(i) The emissions predicted in the "Action" scenario are not greater than the emissions predicted in the "Baseline" scenario, and this can be reasonably expected to be true in the periods between the analysis years; or

(ii) The emissions predicted in the "Action" scenario are not greater than emissions in the baseline year for that NAAQS as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
