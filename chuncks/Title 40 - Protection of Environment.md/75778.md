###### Flow-through system

(g)means a system designed to provide a continuous water flow to waters of the United States through chambers used to produce aquatic animals. Flow-through systems typically use rearing units that are either raceways or tank systems. Rearing units referred to as raceways are typically long, rectangular chambers at or below grade, constructed of earth, concrete, plastic, or metal to which water is supplied by nearby rivers or springs. Rearing units comprised of tank systems use circular or rectangular tanks and are similarly supplied with water to raise aquatic animals. The term does not include net pens.
