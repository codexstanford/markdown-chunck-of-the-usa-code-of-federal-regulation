() State that the minor NSR requirements which are excluded are not eligible for the permit shield under ยง 70.6(f).

(D) A program receiving interim approval for the reason specified in (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section must, upon or before granting of full approval, institute proceedings to reopen part 70 permits to incorporate excluded minor NSR permits as terms of the part 70 permits, as required by ยง 70.7(f)(1)(iv). Such reopening need not follow full permit issuance procedures nor the notice requirement of ยง 70.7(f)(3), but may instead follow the permit revision procedure in effect under the State's approved part 70 program for incorporation of minor NSR permits.
