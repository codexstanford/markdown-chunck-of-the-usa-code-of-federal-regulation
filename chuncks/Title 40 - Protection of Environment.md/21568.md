###### ยง 60.5412a What additional requirements must I meet for determining initial compliance with control devices used to comply with the emission standards for my centrifugal compressor, and storage vessel affected facilities?
####### e.g.

(1) For each combustion control device (, thermal vapor incinerator, catalytic vapor incinerator, boiler, or process heater) you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(i) Ensure that each enclosed combustion control device is maintained in a leak free condition.

(ii) Install and operate a continuous burning pilot flame.

(iii) Operate the combustion control device with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 1 minute during any 15 minute period. A visible emissions test using section 11 of EPA Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part must be performed at least once every calendar month, separated by at least 15 days between each test. The observation period shall be 15 minutes. Devices failing the visible emissions test must follow manufacturer's repair instructions, if available, or best combustion engineering practice as outlined in the unit inspection and maintenance plan, to return the unit to compliant operation. All inspection, repair and maintenance activities for each unit must be recorded in a maintenance and repair log and must be available for inspection. Following return to operation from maintenance or repair activity, each device must pass a Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part visual observation as described in this paragraph.
