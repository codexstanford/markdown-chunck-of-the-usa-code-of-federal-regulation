######## Improved condensers and/or evaporators

(5)means that the coefficient of performance (COP) of air conditioning system using improved evaporator and condenser designs is 10 percent higher, as determined using the bench test procedures described in SAE J2765 "Procedure for Measuring System COP of a Mobile Air Conditioning System on a Test Bench," when compared to a system using standard, or prior model year, component designs (SAE J2765 is incorporated by reference in ยง 86.1). The manufacturer must submit an engineering analysis demonstrating the increased improvement of the system relative to the baseline design, where the baseline component(s) for comparison is the version which a manufacturer most recently had in production on the same vehicle design or in a similar or related vehicle model. The dimensional characteristics (e.g., tube configuration/thickness/spacing, and fin density) of the baseline component(s) shall be compared to the new component(s) to demonstrate the improvement in coefficient of performance.
