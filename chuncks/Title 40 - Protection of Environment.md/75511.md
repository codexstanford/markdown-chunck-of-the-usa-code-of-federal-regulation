####### pH adjustment.

(d)(1) Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation technology to comply with relevant metal limitations results in an inability to comply with the pH range of 6 to 9, the permit issuer may allow the pH level in the final effluent to slightly exceed 9.0 so that the copper, lead, zinc, mercury, and cadmium limitations will be achieved.

(2) In the case of a discharge into natural receiving waters for which the pH, if unaltered by human activities, is or would be less than 6.0 and approved water quality standards authorize such lower pH, the pH limitations for the discharge may be adjusted downward to the pH water quality criterion for the receiving waters provided the other effluent limitations for the discharge are met. In no case shall a pH limitation below 5.0 be permitted.
