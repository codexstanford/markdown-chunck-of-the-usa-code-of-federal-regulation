1. Atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO) are measured indirectly by photometrically measuring the light intensity, at wavelengths greater than 600 nanometers, resulting from the chemiluminescent reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with ozone (O). () NOis first quantitatively reduced to NO() by means of a converter. NO, which commonly exists in ambient air together with NO, passes through the converter unchanged causing a resultant total NOconcentration equal to NO + NO. A sample of the input air is also measured without having passed through the converted. This latter NO measurement is subtracted from the former measurement (NO + NO) to yield the final NOmeasurement. The NO and NO + NOmeasurements may be made concurrently with dual systems, or cyclically with the same system provided the cycle time does not exceed 1 minute.
