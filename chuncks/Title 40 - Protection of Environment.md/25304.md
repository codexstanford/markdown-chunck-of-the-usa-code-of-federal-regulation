####### Failure to adopt program.

(b)In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is able to make case-by-case MACT determinations which conform to the provisions of § 63.43 in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may elect to make such determinations. However, in those instances where the permitting authority elects to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, no such case-by-case MACT determination shall take effect until after it has been submitted by the permitting authority in writing to the appropriate EPA Regional Adminstrator and the EPA Regional Administrator has concurred in writing that the case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority is in conformity with all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44. In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is unable to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may request that the EPA Regional Administrator implement a transitional program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP in the affected State of local jurisdiction while the permitting authority completes development and adoption of a section 112(g) program. Any such transitional section 112(g) program implemented by the EPA Regional Administrator shall conform to all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall remain in effect for no more than 30 months. Continued failure by the permitting authority to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP shall be construed as a failure by the permitting authority to adequately administer and enforce its title V permitting program and shall constitute cause by EPA to apply the sanctions and remedies set forth in the Clean Air Act section 502(I).
