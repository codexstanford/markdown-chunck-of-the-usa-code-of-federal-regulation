(i)May 16, 1996, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board AS 94-4, effective May 16, 1996.

(134) On May 5, 1995, and May 26, 1995, the State of Illinois submitted a State Implementation Plan revision request to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for reactor processes and distillation operation processes in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry as part of the State's control measures for Volatile Organic Material (VOM) emissions for the Chicago and Metro-East (East St. Louis) areas. VOM, as defined by the State of Illinois, is identical to "volatile organic compounds" (VOC), as defined by EPA. This plan was submitted to meet the Clean Air Act requirement for States to adopt Reasonably Available Control Technology rules for sources that are covered by Control Techniques Guideline documents. The EPA approves the State Implementation Plan revision request as it applies to Stepan Company's Millsdale Facility.
