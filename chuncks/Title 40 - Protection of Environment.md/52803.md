###### ยง 98.293 Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process COemissions from each soda ash manufacturing line using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) For each soda ash manufacturing line that meets the conditions specified in ยง 98.33(b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii), you must calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure COemissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) For each soda ash manufacturing line that is not subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, calculate and report the process COemissions from the soda ash manufacturing line by using the procedure in either paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section; and the combustion COemissions using the procedure in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(1) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined process and combustion COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS to measure COemissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(2) Use either Equation CC-1 or Equation CC-2 of this section to calculate annual COprocess emissions from each manufacturing line that calcines trona to produce soda ash:
