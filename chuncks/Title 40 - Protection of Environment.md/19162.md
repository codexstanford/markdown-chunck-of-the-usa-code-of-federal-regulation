###### ยง 60.533 What compliance and certification requirements must I meet and by when?
####### Waiver from submitting test results.

(g)An applicant for certification may apply for a potential waiver of the requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if the wood heater meets either of the following conditions:

(1) The wood heaters of the model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions, as defined in ยง 60.531, to another model line that has already been issued a certificate of compliance. A manufacturer that seeks a waiver of certification testing must identify the model line that has been certified, and must submit a copy of an agreement with the owner of the design permitting the applicant to produce wood heaters of that design.

(2) The manufacturer has previously conducted a valid certification test to demonstrate that the wood heaters of the model line meet the applicable standard specified in ยง 60.532.
