######## Assurance that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit will not be exceeded.

(d)To ensure that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit will not be exceeded when complying with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, you must establish a 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each combustor, establish a 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each combustor, and consider site-specific factors including prescribed criteria to determine if the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit may be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride. If the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit may be exceeded, you must establish an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine as provided by paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
