####### Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.

(a)(1) The chemical substance identified generically as substituted heterocyclic onium compound, salt with 1-(difluorosulfomethyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 3-[(2-methyl-1-oxo-2-propen-1-yl)oxy]tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decane-1-carboxylate (1:1), polymer with 3-ethenylphenol, 1-(1-methylethyl)cyclopentyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate and 1-(7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)cyclopentyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, di-Me 2,2&#x2032;-(1,2-diazenediyl)bis[2-methylpropenoate]-initiated (PMN P-19-112) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted or adhered (during the photolithographic process) onto a semiconductor wafer surface or similar manufactured article used in the production of semiconductor technologies.

(2) The significant new uses are:
