(b)If you used the mass balance method to calculate emissions for any of the reporting years 2011, 2012, 2013, or 2014, you must conduct mass balance reporting for that reporting year. For processes whose emissions were determined using the mass balance method under the former § 98.123(b), as included in paragraph 1 of Appendix A of this subpart, you must report the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for each process on an annual basis.

(1) If you calculated the relative and absolute errors under the former § 98.123(b)(1), the overall absolute and relative errors calculated for the process under the former § 98.123(b)(1), in metric tons COe and decimal fraction, respectively.

(2) The method used to estimate the total mass of fluorine in destroyed or recaptured streams (specify the former § 98.123(b)(4) or (15), as included in paragraph 1 of Appendix A of this subpart).
