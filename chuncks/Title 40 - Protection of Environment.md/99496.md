####### Locomotive

means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment designed for moving or propelling cars that are designed to carry freight, passengers or other equipment, but which itself is not designed or intended to carry freight, passengers (other than those operating the locomotive) or other equipment. The following other equipment are not locomotives (see 40 CFR parts 86, 89, and 1039 for this diesel-powered equipment):

(1) Equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails is not a locomotive.

(2) Specialized railroad equipment for maintenance, construction, post-accident recovery of equipment, and repairs; and other similar equipment, are not locomotives.

(3) Vehicles propelled by engines with total rated power of less than 750 kW (1006 hp) are not locomotives, unless the owner (which may be a manufacturer) chooses to have the equipment certified to meet the requirements of this part (under ยง 1033.615). Where equipment is certified as a locomotive pursuant to this paragraph (3), it is subject to the requirements of this part for the remainder of its service life. For locomotives propelled by two or more engines, the total rated power is the sum of the rated power of each engine.
