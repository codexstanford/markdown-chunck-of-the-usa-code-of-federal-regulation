(D) pH shall be within the range of 6.5 to 9.0 with a human-caused variation of less than 0.5 units.

(E) Turbidity shall not exceed 10 NTU over background turbidity when the background turbidity is 50 NTU or less, or have more than a 20 percent increase in turbidity when the background turbidity is more than 50 NTU.

(F) Toxic, radioactive, nonconventional, or deleterious material concentrations shall be less than those of public health significance, or which may cause acute or chronic toxic conditions to the aquatic biota, or which may adversely affect designated water uses.
