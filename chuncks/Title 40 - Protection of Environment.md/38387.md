####### i.e.,

7.1.8.2 The hourly Hg emissions rate (lb/TBtu or lb/GWh, as applicable), calculated according to section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this appendix, rounded to the same precision as the standard (with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation), if valid values of Hg concentration and all other required parameters (stack gas volumetric flow rate, diluent gas concentration, electrical load, and moisture data, as applicable) are obtained for the hour. Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged;

7.1.8.3 An identification code for the formula (either the selected equation from Method 19 in section 6.2.1 of this appendix or Equation A-4 in section 6.2.2 of this appendix) used to derive the hourly Hg emission rate from Hg concentration, flow rate, electrical load, diluent gas concentration, and moisture data (as applicable); and

7.1.8.4 A code indicating that the Hg emission rate was not calculated for the hour, if valid data for Hg concentration and/or any of the other necessary parameters are not obtained for the hour. For the purposes of this appendix, the substitute data values required under part 75 of this chapter for diluent gas concentration, stack gas flow rate and moisture content are not considered to be valid data.

7.1.8.5 If applicable, a code to indicate that the default gross output (as defined in ยง 63.10042) was used to calculate the Hg emission rate.

7.1.8.6 If applicable, a code to indicate that the diluent cap (as defined in ยง 63.10042) was used to calculate the Hg emission rate.
