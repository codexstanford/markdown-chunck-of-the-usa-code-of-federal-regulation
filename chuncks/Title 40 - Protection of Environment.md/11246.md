####### Determination of Failure to Attain:

(n)Effective October 16, 2020, the EPA has determined that the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin Serious PMnonattainment area failed to attain the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2019. This determination triggers the requirements of CAA sections 179(d) and 189(d) for the State of California to submit a revision to the California SIP for the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin to the EPA by December 31, 2020. The SIP revision must, among other elements, demonstrate expeditious attainment of the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS within the time period provided under CAA section 179(d) and that provides for annual reduction in the emissions of direct PMor a PMplan precursor pollutant within the area of not less than five percent until attainment.

(o) Within 18 months after the effective date of the reclassification of the reclassification of the San Joaquin Valley nonattainment area from Moderate to Serious for the 2012 PMNAAQS, California must adopt and submit an emissions inventory and provisions to assure that BACM shall be implemented no later than four years after the date of reclassification. Also, by December 31, 2023, California must adopt and submit a Serious area plan that includes an attainment demonstration, a reasonable further progress plan, quantitative milestones, contingency measures, and such other measures as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of the 2012 PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date, in accordance with the requirements of subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act.
