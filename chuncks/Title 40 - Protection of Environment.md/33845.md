######## Waste management

unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams or residuals. Examples of waste management units include wastewater tanks, air flotation units, surface impoundments, containers, oil-water or organic-water separators, individual drain systems, biological wastewater treatment units, waste incinerators, and organic removal devices such as steam and air stripper units, and thin film evaporation units. If such equipment is being operated as a recovery device, then it is part of a miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process and is not a waste management unit.
