###### Interpollutant offsetting.

5.In meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling, the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant unless interpollutant offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph IV.G.5. The offset requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling for direct PMemissions or emissions of precursors of PMmay be satisfied by offsetting reductions of direct PMemissions or emissions of any PMprecursor identified under paragraph II.A.31 (iii) of this Ruling if such offsets comply with an interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio approved by the Administrator.

(i) A reviewing authority may choose to satisfy the offset requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling for emissions of the ozone precursors NOand VOC by offsetting reductions of emissions of either precursor, if all other requirements contained in this Ruling for such offsets are also satisfied. For a specific permit application, if the implementation of IPT is acceptable by the reviewing authority, the permit applicant shall submit to the reviewing authority for approval a case-specific permit IPT ratio for determining the required amount of emissions reductions to offset the proposed emissions increase when considered along with the applicable offset ratio as specified in paragraphs IV.G.2 through 4 of this Ruling. As part of the ratio submittal, the applicant shall submit the proposed permit-specific ozone IPT ratio to the reviewing authority, accompanied by the following information:

(a) A description of the air quality model(s) that were used to propose a case-specific ratio; and

(b) The proposed ratio for the precursor substitution and accompanying calculations; and

(c) A modeling demonstration showing that such ratio(s) as applied to the proposed project and credit source will provide an equivalent or greater air quality benefit with respect to ground level concentrations in the ozone nonattainment area than an offset of the emitted precursor would achieve.

(ii) The offset requirements of paragraph IV.A, Condition 3 of this Ruling for direct PMemissions or emissions of precursors of PMmay be satisfied by offsetting reductions of direct PMemissions or emissions of any PMprecursor identified under paragraph II.A.31 (iii) of this Ruling if such offsets comply with an interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio approved by the Administrator.
