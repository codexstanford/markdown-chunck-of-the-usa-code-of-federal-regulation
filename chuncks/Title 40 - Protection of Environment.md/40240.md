2.3The analyst must have knowledge of spectral patterns to choose an appropriate absorption path length or determine if sample dilution is necessary. The analyst should also understand FTIR instrument operation well enough to choose instrument settings that are consistent with the objectives of the analysis.

See appendix A of the FTIR Protocol.

This method will not measure HCl under conditions: (1) where the sample gas stream can condense in the sampling system or the instrumentation, or (2) where a high moisture content sample relative to the analyte concentrations imparts spectral interference due to the water vapor absorbance bands. For measuring HCl the first (sampling) consideration is more critical. Spectral interference from water vapor is not a significant problem except at very high moisture levels and low HCl concentrations.
