####### § 63.4951 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## Compliance demonstration.

(h)The calculated organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4930 and 63.4931. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4910 and the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.4920, you must identify the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limit, include a statement that the coating operation or group of coating operations was in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, determined according to this section.
