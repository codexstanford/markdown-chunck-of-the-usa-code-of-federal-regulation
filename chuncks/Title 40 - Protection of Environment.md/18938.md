(iv) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test.

(3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for each affected facility that uses a control device that recovers the VOC's (e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under ยง 60.462(a) (2) or (3).

(i) Calculate the total mass of VOC's consumed (M+ M) during each calendar month for each affected facility using equation (1).

(ii) Calculate the total mass of VOC's recovered (M) during each calendar month using the following equation:

(iii) Calculate the overall reduction efficiency of the control device (R) for each calendar month for each affected facility using the following equation:

(iv) Calculate the total volume of coating solids consumed (L) and the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (B) and (C) of this section.

(v) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere (N) for each calendar month for each affected facility using equation (8).
