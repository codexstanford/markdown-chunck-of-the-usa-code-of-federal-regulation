####### Allowance adjustments by Administrator.

(2)(i) The Administrator will adjust the number of allowances in the compliance account for each source that includes the opt-in source or a replacement unit to reflect any changes between the estimated values submitted in the thermal energy plan pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and the actual values submitted in the thermal energy compliance report pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The values to be considered for this adjustment include:

(A) The number of allowances transferable by the opt-in source to each replacement unit, calculated in paragraph (b) of this section using the actual, rather than estimated, thermal energy at the replacement unit replacing thermal energy at the opt-in source.

(B) The number of allowances deducted from the compliance account of the source that includes the opt-in source, calculated under ยง 74.44(b)(2).

(ii) If the opt-in source includes in the opt-in utilization report under ยง 74.44 estimates for reductions in heat input, then the Administrator will adjust the number of allowances in the compliance account for each source that includes the opt-in source or a replacement unit to reflect any differences between the estimated values submitted in the opt-in utilization report and the actual values submitted in the confirmation report pursuant to ยง 74.44(c)(2).
