####### Torque.

(2)Use a series of calibration weights and a calibration lever arm to simulate engine torque. You may instead use the engine or dynamometer itself to generate a nominal torque that is measured by a reference load cell or proving ring in series with the torque-measurement system. In this case, use the reference load cell measurement as the reference value. Refer to ยง 1065.310 for a torque-calibration procedure similar to the linearity verification in this section.
