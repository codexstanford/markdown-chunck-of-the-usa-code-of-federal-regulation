3.1 Obtain a sample at least 30 in. long across the machine width. Sample should be free of dirt or foreign matter.

3.2 Lay out the cutting pattern according to the plant's written procedure for the designated product.

3.2 Cut samples using one square foot (or multiples of one square foot) template.

3.3 Weigh product and obtain area weight (lb/ft).

3.4 Measure sample thickness.

3.5 Calculate the product density:
