####### Release to water.

(iv)(A) Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) N = 6. However the requirements of ยง 721.91(a)(4) do not apply. Instead, if control technologies are in place to treat the waste stream containing the PMN substance, the amount of the PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms releases. No more than 40 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.

(B) In lieu of calculating the quotient, monitoring or alternative calculations may be used to predict the surface water concentrations expected to result from the intended release of the substance, if the monitoring procedures or calculations have been approved for such purposes by EPA.
