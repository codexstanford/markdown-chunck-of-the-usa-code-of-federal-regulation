####### Option 1.

(i)(A) CFV pressure ratio. Based upon the calibration data selected to meet the criteria for paragraphs (d)(7) (iv) and (v) of this section, in which Kis constant, select the data values associated with the calibration point with the lowest absolute venturi inlet pressure. With this set of calibration data, calculated the following CFV pressure ratio limit, Pr:

(B) The venturi pressure ratio (Pr) during all emissions tests must be less than, or equal to, the calibration pressure ratio limit (Pr) derived from the CFV calibration data, such that:
