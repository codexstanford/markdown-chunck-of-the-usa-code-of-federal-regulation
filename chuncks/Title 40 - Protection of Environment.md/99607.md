####### Derate schedule.

(d)Engines must follow the derate schedule described in this paragraph (d) if the engine detects a fault condition identified in paragraph (b) of this section. The derate takes the form of a maximum drive speed for the vehicle. This maximum drive speed decreases over time based on hours of non-idle engine operation without regard to engine starting.

(1) Apply speed-limiting derates according to the following schedule:

(2) You may design and produce engines that will be installed in motorcoaches with an alternative derate schedule that starts with a 65 mi/hr derate when a fault condition is first detected, steps down to 50 mi/hr after 80 hours, and concludes with a final derate speed of 25 mi/hr after 180 hours of non-idle operation.
