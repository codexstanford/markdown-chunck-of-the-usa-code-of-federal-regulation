###### § 63.1326 Batch process vents - recordkeeping provisions.
####### Compliance demonstration records.

(b)Each owner or operator of a batch process vent or aggregate batch vent stream complying with § 63.1322(a) or (b), shall keep the following records, as applicable, readily accessible:

(1) The annual mass emissions of halogen atoms in the batch process vent or aggregate batch vent stream determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.1323(h);

(2) If the owner or operator of a batch process vent has chosen to comply with § 63.1322(a)(2), records documenting the batch cycle percent reduction as specified in § 63.1325(c)(2); and

(3) When using a flare to comply with § 63.1322 (a)(1), (a)(3), (b)(1), or (b)(3):

(i) The flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted or non-assisted);

(ii) All visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the compliance determination required by § 63.1333(e); and

(iii) Periods when all pilot flames were absent.

(4) The following information when using a control device to meet the percent reduction requirement specified in § 63.1322(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(2), or (b)(3):

(i) For an incinerator or non-combustion control device, the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC achieved, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.1325(c) for batch process vents and § 63.1325(e) for aggregate batch vent streams;

(ii) For a boiler or process heater, a description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater;

(iii) For a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 megawatts and where the vent stream is introduced with combustion air or used as a secondary fuel and is not mixed with the primary fuel, the percent reduction of organic HAP or TOC achieved, as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.1325(c) for batch process vents and § 63.1325(e) for aggregate batch vent streams; and

(iv) For a scrubber or other halogen reduction device following a combustion device to control halogenated batch process vents or halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, the percent reduction of total hydrogen halides and halogens as determined under § 63.1325(d)(3) or the emission limit determined under § 63.1325(d)(4).

(5) When complying with the 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration standard specified in § 63.1322(b)(2), records of the outlet concentration of organic HAP or TOC on a dry basis. If supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, the outlet concentration shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen. If supplemental combustion air is not used, a correction to 3 percent oxygen is not required.
