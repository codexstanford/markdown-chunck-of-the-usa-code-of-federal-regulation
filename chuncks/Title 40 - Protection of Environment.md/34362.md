###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### § 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## e.g.,

(iv) For all intermittently-controlled work stations, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted during periods of no control. During periods of control, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted, less the reductions provided by the corresponding capture system and control device, in accordance with the most recently measured capture and destruction efficiencies, or in accordance with the measured mass of VOC recovered for the month (carbon control or condensers). You may account for organic HAP or volatile organic content retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted if you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).

(v) You must record the organic HAP or volatile organic content input to all work stations of your individual/grouping(s) of lines and the mass of coating materials and/or solids applied, if applicable, and determine corresponding emissions during all periods of operation, including malfunctions or startups and shutdowns of any web coating line or control device.

(3) You are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) if each of your individual/grouping(s) of lines, meets one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable. If operating parameter limit deviations occurred, including periods that the oxidizer control device(s), if any, operated at an average combustion temperature more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e), or the 3-hour average temperature difference across the catalyst bed at no less than 80 percent of this average temperature differential and the catalytic oxidizer maintained a minimum temperature 50 degrees Fahrenheit above the catalyst's ignition temperature, you are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month, if assuming no control of emissions for each 3-hour deviation period (or in accordance with an alternate approved method), one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section was met.

(i) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on HAP applied is no more than 0.05 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.02 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at a new affected source; or

(ii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or

(iii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at a new affected source.
