(3) Perform a least-squares regression of, versus, by calculating slope,, and intercept,, as described for a floating intercept in ยง 1065.602.

(4) Repeat the procedure in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section for every speed that you run your PDP.

(5) The following table illustrates a range of typical values for different PDP speeds:

(6) For each speed at which you operate the PDP, use the appropriate regression equation from this paragraph (b) to calculate flow rate during emission testing as described in ยง 1065.642.
