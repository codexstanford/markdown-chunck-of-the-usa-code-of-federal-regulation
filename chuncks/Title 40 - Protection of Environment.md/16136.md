###### ยง 57.602 Approval of proposal.
####### EPA approval.

(b)(1) If the issuing agency will not be EPA, the smelter owner or the issuing agency may also submit to EPA the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section at the same time the information is submitted to the issuing agency. As soon as possible after the receipt of the information described in paragraph (a) of this section, EPA shall certify to the issuing agency and to the applicant whether or not in the judgment of the Administrator the smelter owner's final proposals are approvable. If EPA does not receive an advance copy of the proposal, the ultimate approval will occur when the NSO is approved rather than in advance of receipt of the NSO.

(2) A prerequisite for approval of an R&D proposal by EPA and any issuing agency is that the planned work must yield the most cost effective technology possible.
