####### Discrete form of a reportable chemical substance

differs from another form of the same reportable chemical substance in one or more of the following 3 characteristics:

(i) The change in the reportable chemical substance is due to all of the following:

(A) There is a change in process to effect a change in size, a change in one or more of the properties of the reportable chemical substances identified in paragraph (i)(C) of this definition, or both;

(B) There is a size variation in the mean particle size that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the mean particle size (+/- 7 times the standard deviation); and

(C) There is a change in at least one of the following properties: Zeta potential, specific surface area, dispersion stability, or surface reactivity, that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the measured value (+/- 7 times the standard deviation).

(ii) The reportable chemical substance has a different morphology. Examples of morphologies include but are not limited to sphere, rod, ellipsoid, cylinder, needle, wire, fiber, cage, hollow shell, tree, flower, ring, torus, cone, and sheet.

(iii) A reportable chemical substance that is coated with another chemical substance or mixture at the end of manufacturing or processing has a coating that consists of a different chemical substance or mixture.
