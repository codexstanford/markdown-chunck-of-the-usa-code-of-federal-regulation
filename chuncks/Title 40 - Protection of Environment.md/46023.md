(2) The Administrator will proceed as in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the vehicles (or engines) belonging to an engine family or engine family-evaporative/refueling emission family combination (as applicable), all of which comply with all applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate).

Within 30 days following receipt of the notification, the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determination. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determination and data in support of such objections.

(ii) Delete from the application for certification the engines represented by the failing test engine. (Engines so deleted may be included in a later request for certification under § 86.079-32.)
