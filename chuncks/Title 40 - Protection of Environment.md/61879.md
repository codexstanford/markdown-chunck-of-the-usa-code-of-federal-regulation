###### ยง 180.645 Thiencarbazone-methyl; tolerances for residues.
####### H,H

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of thiencarbazone-methyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of thiencarbazone-methyl [methyl 4-[[[(4,5-dihydro-3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-1-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-5-methyl-3-thiophenecarboxylate] and its metabolite BYH 18636-MMT [5-methoxy-4-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3-1,2,4-triazol-3-one], calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of thiencarbazone-methyl, in or on the following food commodities of animal origin:
