(9) Check the analyzer response using the span gas that has the average concentration of Oexpected during testing. Record the mean response of 30 seconds of stabilized sample data as.

(10) Check the zero response of the FID analyzer using the zero gas used during emission testing. If the mean zero response of 30 seconds of stabilized sample data is within +/-0.5% of the span reference value used in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, proceed to the next step; otherwise restart the procedure at paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
