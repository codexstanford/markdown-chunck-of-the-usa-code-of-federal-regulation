####### Creditable samples

are daily values in the combined site record that are given credit for data completeness. The number of creditable samples (cn) for a given year also governs which value in the sorted series of daily values represents the 98th percentile for that year. Creditable samples include daily values collected on scheduled sampling days and valid make-up samples taken for missed or invalidated samples on scheduled sampling days.
