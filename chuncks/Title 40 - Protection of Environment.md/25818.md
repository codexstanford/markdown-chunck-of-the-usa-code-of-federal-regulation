###### ยง 63.145 Process wastewater provisions - test methods and procedures to determine compliance.
####### Concentration in wastewater stream entering the combustion treatment process.

(1)The concentration of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds entering the treatment process shall be determined as provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per ยง 63.144(b)(5)(ii). The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 of appendix A of this part shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not adjust by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
