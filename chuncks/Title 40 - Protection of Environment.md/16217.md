2.6.2 Discount Factor. The discount factor corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital for any forecast year is computed according to the following equation:

The horizon value, which is described in Section 2.7, is computed as of 1990, the end of the detailed forecast period. The discount factor to be applied to the horizon value is the same as for any other 1990 figure. For example, if the application is made in 1984, the value of N is 7.

2.7 Horizon Value. The horizon value is the present value of a stream of cash flows or net income for 15 years beyond the last forecast year. Applicants must compute the horizon value by capitalizing the average forecast value of the last two forecast years using the current real weighted cost of capital. The line item instructions for schedules having a horizon value entry will specify the values to be capitalized.
