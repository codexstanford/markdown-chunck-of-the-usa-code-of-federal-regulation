(b)(1)(i) The standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section refer to the noise emissions as measured in accordance with the measurement methodology specified in appendix I-1 for all motorcycles except those street motorcycles meeting the definition of ยง 205.151(a)(2)(ii). Exhaust systems which alter a motorcycle's maximum rated RPM shall be tested using the unmodified motorcycle's maximum rated RPM to determine closing RPM or test RPM.

(2) Exhaust system components sold as separate products shall be tested as part of a system made up of that part and original equipment components to complete the system.

(3) Exhaust system components sold as separate products which are incompatible with original equipment components necessary to make a complete exhaust system, or which would not meet standards as prescribed in this subpart in such configuration, may be tested with non-original equipment components provided that the provisions of ยง 205.169(e)(1)(ii)(B) are carried out.
