####### ยง 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## Changes that could affect system removal efficiency.

(ii)(A) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor in a manner than could decrease the system removal efficiency, you are subject to the requirements of ยง 63.1206(b)(5) for conducting a performance test to reestablish the combustor's system removal efficiency and you must submit a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the lower system removal efficiency and the reduced feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride.

(B) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor in a manner than could increase the system removal efficiency, and you elect to document the increased system removal efficiency to establish higher feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride, you are subject to the requirements of ยง 63.1206(b)(5) for conducting a performance test to reestablish the combustor's system removal efficiency. You must also submit to the permitting authority a revised eligibility demonstration documenting the higher system removal efficiency and the increased feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride.
