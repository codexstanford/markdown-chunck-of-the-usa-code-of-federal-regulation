####### Vehicle instrumentation.

(2)(i) The vehicle must be equipped with temperature sensors and pressure transducers, as described in ยง 86.107-96 (e) and (f), and a driver's aid, which shall be configured to provide the test driver with the desired vehicle speed vs. time trace and the actual vehicle speed.

(ii) A computer, data logger, or strip chart data recorder shall record the following parameters at a minimum during the test run:

(A) Desired speed;

(B) Actual speed;

(C) Instantaneous average liquid fuel temperature (T); and

(D) Vapor space pressure (the Administrator may omit measurement of fuel tank pressure).

(iii) The data recording system described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section shall be capable of resolving time to +/-1 s, capable of resolving temperature to +/-2 &#xB0;F, capable of resolving pressure to +/-1.0 inch of water, and capable of resolving speed to +/-1 mph. The temperature and pressure signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 minute; speed signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 second.
