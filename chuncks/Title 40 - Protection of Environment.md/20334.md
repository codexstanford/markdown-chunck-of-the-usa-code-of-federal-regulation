####### § 60.2165 What monitoring equipment must I install and what parameters must I monitor?

(a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitation under § 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 2 of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 2 of this subpart at all times except as specified in § 60.2170(a).

(b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section:

(1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for each exhaust stack of the fabric filter;

(2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations;

(3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less;

(4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings;

(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor;

(6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will alert automatically an operator when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating personnel;

(7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter; and

(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.

(c) If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 60.2115.

(d) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum mercury sorbent flow rate once per hour.

(e) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must complete the following:

(1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.2125, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI) or the minimum reagent flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times; and

(2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the nitrogen oxides emissions limit.

(f) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must monitor the secondary power to the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the mercury or particulate matter performance test.

(g) For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride emissions discharged to the atmosphere, as specified in § 60.2145(j), and record the output of the system. You may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual testing with EPA Method 321 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A. For units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a hydrogen chloride CEMS for conducting the hydrogen chloride initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a hydrogen chloride CEMS, you are not required to monitor the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow rate, the minimum scrubber liquor pH, or the monitoring minimum injection rate.
