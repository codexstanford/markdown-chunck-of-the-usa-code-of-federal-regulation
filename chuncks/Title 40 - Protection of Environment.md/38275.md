####### Sorbent Trap Monitoring System

3.1.2means the equipment required to monitor Hg emissions continuously by using paired sorbent traps containing iodated charcoal (IC) or other suitable sorbent medium. The monitoring system consists of a probe, paired sorbent traps, an umbilical line, moisture removal components, an airtight sample pump, a gas flow meter, and an automated data acquisition and handling system. The system samples the stack gas at a constant proportional rate relative to the stack gas volumetric flow rate. The sampling is a batch process. The average Hg concentration in the stack gas for the sampling period is determined, in units of micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (Âµg/dscm), based on the sample volume measured by the gas flow meter and the mass of Hg collected in the sorbent traps.
