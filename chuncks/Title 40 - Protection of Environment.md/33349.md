####### ยง 63.2268 Initial compliance demonstration for a wet control device.

If you use a wet control device as the sole means of reducing HAP emissions, you must develop and implement a plan for review and approval to address how organic HAP captured in the wastewater from the wet control device is contained or destroyed to minimize re-release to the atmosphere such that the desired emissions reductions are obtained. You must submit the plan with your Notification of Compliance Status.
