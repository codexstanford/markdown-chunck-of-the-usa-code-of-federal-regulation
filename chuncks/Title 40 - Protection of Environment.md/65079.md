() The owner or operator of the CCR surface impoundment must apply an appropriate statistical test to identify any trends of increasing concentrations within the monitoring data. For normally distributed datasets, linear regression will be used to identify trends and determine the associated magnitude. For non-normally distributed datasets, the Mann-Kendall test will be used to identify trends and the Theil-Sen trend line will be used to determine the associated magnitude. If a trend is identified, the owner or operator of the CCR surface impoundment will use the upper 95th percentile confidence limit on the trend line to estimate future concentrations. The owner or operator will project this trendline into the future for a duration set to the maximum number of years established in ยง 257.102 for closure of the surface impoundment.
