1.5.9.1 Assuming the NOzero has been properly adjusted while sampling zero air in step 1.5.7, adjust Fand Fas determined in section 1.4.2. Adjust Fto generate an NO concentration near 90% of theof the NO range. Sample this NO concentration until the NO and NOresponses have stabilized. Using the NO calibration curve obtained in section 1.5.8, measure and record the NO concentration as [NO]. Using the NOcalibration curve obtained in section 1.5.8, measure and record the NOconcentration as [NO].

1.5.9.2 Adjust the Ogenerator to generate sufficient Oto produce a decrease in the NO concentration equivalent to approximately 80% of the URL of the NOrange. The decrease must not exceed 90% of the NO concentration determined in step 1.5.9.1. After the analyzer responses have stabilized, record the resultant NO and NOconcentrations as [NO]and [NO].

1.5.9.3 Calculate the resulting NOconcentration from:

1.5.9.4 Maintaining the same F, F, and Fas in section 1.5.9.1, adjust the ozone generator to obtain several other concentrations of NOover the NOrange (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested). Calculate each NOconcentration using equation (13) and record the corresponding analyzer NOand NOresponses. Plot the analyzer's NOresponses versus the corresponding calculated NOconcentrations and draw or calculate the NOcalibration curve.
