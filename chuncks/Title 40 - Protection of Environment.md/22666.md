Calculate the polynomial correlation curve coefficients (,, and) using Equations 11-19 through 11-21, respectively:

(ii) Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval half range (CI) by first calculating the C coefficients (Cto C) using Equations 11-23 and 11-24:

(iii) Calculate the tolerance interval half range (TI) for the predicted PM concentration at the x value that corresponds to Î”, as indicated in Equation 11-29 for the polynomial correlation, using Equations 11-30 and 11-31:

(iv) Calculate the polynomial correlation coefficient (r) using Equation 11-33:

(3) How do I evaluate a logarithmic correlation for my correlation test data? To evaluate a logarithmic correlation, which has the form indicated by Equation 11-34, follow the procedures described in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Perform a logarithmic transformation of each PM CEMS response value (x values) using Equation 11-35:

(ii) Using the values for x&#x2032; in place of the values for x, perform the same procedures used to develop the linear correlation equation described in paragraph (1)(i) of this section. The resulting equation has the form indicated by Equation 11-36:
