These instructions describe the use of the equation specified in ยง 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) to compute estimated surface water concentrations which will result from release of a substance identified in subpart E of this part. The equation shall be computed for each site using the stream flow rate appropriate for the site according to paragraph (b) of this section, and the highest number of kilograms calculated to be released for that site on a given day according to paragraph (a) of this section. Two variables shall be considered in computing the equation, the number of kilograms released, and receiving stream flow.
