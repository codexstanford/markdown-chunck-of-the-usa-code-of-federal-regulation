## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 76 - ACID RAIN NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM
##### § 76.10 Alternative emission limitations.
###### General provisions.

(a)(1) The designated representative of an affected unit that is not an early election unit pursuant to § 76.8 and cannot meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 using, for Group 1 boilers, either low NOburner technology or an alternative technology in accordance with paragraph (e)(11) of this section, or, for tangentially fired boilers, separated overfire air, or, for Group 2 boilers, the technology on which the applicable emission limitation is based may petition the permitting authority for an alternative emission limitation less stringent than the applicable emission limitation.

(2) In order for the unit to qualify for an alternative emission limitation, the designated representative shall demonstrate that the affected unit cannot meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7 based on a showing, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that:

(i)(A) For a tangentially fired boiler, the owner or operator has either properly installed low NOburner technology or properly installed separated overfire air; or

(B) For a dry bottom wall-fired boiler (other than a unit applying cell burner technology), the owner or operator has properly installed low NOburner technology; or

(C) For a Group 1 boiler, the owner or operator has properly installed an alternative technology (including but not limited to reburning, selective noncatalytic reduction, or selective catalytic reduction) that achieves NOemission reductions demonstrated in accordance with paragraph (e)(11) of this section; or

(D) For a Group 2 boiler, the owner or operator has properly installed the appropriate NOemission control technology on which the applicable emission limitation in § 76.6 is based; and

(ii) The installed NOemission control system has been designed to meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7; and

(iii) For a demonstration period of at least 15 months or other period of time, as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section:

(A) The NOemission control system has been properly installed and properly operated according to specifications and procedures designed to minimize the emissions of NOto the atmosphere;

(B) Unit operating data as specified in this section show that the unit and NOemission control system were operated in accordance with the bid and design specifications on which the design of the NOemission control system was based; and

(C) Unit operating data as specified in this section, continuous emission monitoring data obtained pursuant to part 75 of this chapter, and the test data specific to the NOemission control system show that the unit could not meet the applicable emission limitation in § 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7.
