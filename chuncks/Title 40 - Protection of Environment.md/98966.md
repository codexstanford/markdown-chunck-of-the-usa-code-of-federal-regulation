####### Tier 2 data requirements.

(g)Studies at the Tier 2 level are designed to answer questions about the disposition of test chemicals based on the existing toxicology data base and/or results of Tier 1 testing which may have a significant impact on the risk assessment for the test chemical. Such studies may address questions regarding absorption, persistence, or distribution of the test chemical, or a definitive alteration in the metabolic profile occurring with dose which may be of toxicological concern. At the Tier 2 level, only those studies which address a specific concern are required, and if required must be conducted according to mutual agreement between the registrant and the Agency. Flexibility will be allowed in the design of specific experiments as warranted by technological advances in this field.
