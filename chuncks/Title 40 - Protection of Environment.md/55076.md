###### ยง 131.36 Toxics criteria for those states not complying with Clean Water Act section 303(c)(2)(B).
####### Scope.

(a)This section is not a general promulgation of the section 304(a) criteria for priority toxic pollutants but is restricted to specific pollutants in specific States.

(b)(1) EPA's Section 304(a) criteria for Priority Toxic Pollutants.

(iii) If a State does not have such a low flow value for numeric standards compliance, then none shall apply and the criteria included in paragraph (d) of this section herein apply at all flows.

(3) The aquatic life criteria in the matrix in paragraph (b) of this section apply as follows:

(i) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or less than 1 part per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the freshwater criteria in Column B;

(ii) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or greater than 10 parts per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the saltwater criteria in Column C; and

(iii) For waters in which the salinity is between 1 and 10 parts per thousand as defined in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, the applicable criteria are the more stringent of the freshwater or saltwater criteria. However, the Regional Administrator may approve the use of the alternative freshwater or saltwater criteria if scientifically defensible information and data demonstrate that on a site-specific basis the biology of the waterbody is dominated by freshwater aquatic life and that freshwater criteria are more appropriate; or conversely, the biology of the waterbody is dominated by saltwater aquatic life and that saltwater criteria are more appropriate.
