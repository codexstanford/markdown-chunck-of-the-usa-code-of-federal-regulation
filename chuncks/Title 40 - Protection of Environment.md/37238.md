####### ยง 63.8000 What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
######## Periodic verification.,i.e.,

(3)For a control device with total inlet HAP emissions less than 1 ton per year (tpy), you must establish at least one operating limit for a parameter that you will measure and record at least once per averaging period (daily or block) to verify that the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the same parameter that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit or range and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.
