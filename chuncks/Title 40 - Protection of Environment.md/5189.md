(B) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (a)(1)(xxviii)(B)(), sums to at least 50 percent of the amount that is a "significant emissions increase," as defined under paragraph (a)(1)(xxvii) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (a)(6)(vi)(B) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (a)(6)(vi)(A) of this section, then provisions (a)(6)(ii) through (v) do not apply to the project.

(7) Each plan shall provide that the owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section available for review upon a request for inspection by the reviewing authority or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in ยง 70.4(b)(3)(viii) of this chapter.

(8) The plan shall provide that the requirements of this section applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of volatile organic compounds shall apply to nitrogen oxides emissions from major stationary sources and major modifications of nitrogen oxides in an ozone transport region or in any ozone nonattainment area, except in ozone nonattainment areas or in portions of an ozone transport region where the Administrator has granted a NOwaiver applying the standards set forth under section 182(f) of the Act and the waiver continues to apply.

(9)(i) The plan shall require that in meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the ratio of total actual emissions reductions to the emissions increase shall be at least 1:1 unless an alternative ratio is provided for the applicable nonattainment area in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii) through (a)(9)(iv) of this section.

(ii) The plan shall require that in meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section for ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, the ratio of total actual emissions reductions of VOC to the emissions increase of VOC shall be as follows:

(A) In any marginal nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.1:1;

(B) In any moderate nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.15:1;

(C) In any serious nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.2:1;

(D) In any severe nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.3:1 (except that the ratio may be at least 1.2:1 if the approved plan also requires all existing major sources in such nonattainment area to use BACT for the control of VOC); and

(E) In any extreme nonattainment area for ozone-at least 1.5:1 (except that the ratio may be at least 1.2:1 if the approved plan also requires all existing major sources in such nonattainment area to use BACT for the control of VOC); and

(iii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section for meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the ratio of total actual emissions reductions of VOC to the emissions increase of VOC shall be at least 1.15:1 for all areas within an ozone transport region that is subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, except for serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act.

(iv) The plan shall require that in meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section for ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart 1, part D, title I of the Act (but are not subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, including 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas subject to 40 CFR 51.902(b)), the ratio of total actual emissions reductions of VOC to the emissions increase of VOC shall be at least 1:1.

(10) The plan shall require that the requirements of this section applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM-10 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM-10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels that exceed the PM-10 ambient standards in the area.

(11) The plan shall require that, in meeting the emissions offset requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant, unless interprecursor offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph. The plan may allow the offset requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for direct PMemissions or emissions of precursors of PMto be satisfied by offsetting reductions in direct PMemissions or emissions of any PMprecursor identified under paragraph (a)(1)(xxxvii)(C) of this section if such offsets comply with the interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio established in the approved plan for a particular nonattainment area.

(12) The plan shall require that in any area designated nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS and designated nonattainment for the 1997 ozone NAAQS on April 6, 2015 the requirements of this section applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of ozone shall include the anti-backsliding requirements contained at ยง 51.1105.

(13) The plan shall require that the control requirements of this section applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PMshall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PMprecursors in a PMnonattainment area, except that a reviewing authority may exempt new major stationary sources and major modifications of a particular precursor from the requirements of this section for PMif the NNSR precursor demonstration submitted to and approved by the Administrator shows that such sources do not contribute significantly to PMlevels that exceed the standard in the area. Any demonstration submitted for the Administrator's review must meet the conditions for a NNSR precursor demonstration as set forth in ยง 51.1006(a)(3).

(b)(1) Each plan shall include a preconstruction review permit program or its equivalent to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the Act for any new major stationary source or major modification as defined in paragraphs (a)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section. Such a program shall apply to any such source or modification that would locate in any area designated as attainment or unclassifiable for any national ambient air quality standard pursuant to section 107 of the Act, when it would cause or contribute to a violation of any national ambient air quality standard.

(2) A major source or major modification will be considered to cause or contribute to a violation of a national ambient air quality standard when such source or modification would, at a minimum, exceed the following significance levels at any locality that does not or would not meet the applicable national standard:

(3) Such a program may include a provision which allows a proposed major source or major modification subject to paragraph (b) of this section to reduce the impact of its emissions upon air quality by obtaining sufficient emission reductions to, at a minimum, compensate for its adverse ambient impact where the major source or major modification would otherwise cause or contribute to a violation of any national ambient air quality standard. The plan shall require that, in the absence of such emission reductions, the State or local agency shall deny the proposed construction.

(4) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates that, as to that pollutant, the source or modification is located in an area designated as nonattainment pursuant to section 107 of the Act.
