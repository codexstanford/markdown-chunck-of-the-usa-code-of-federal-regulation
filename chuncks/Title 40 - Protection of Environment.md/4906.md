(i) Using that portion of a stack which exceeds good engineering practice stack height:

(ii) Varying the rate of emission of a pollutant according to atmospheric conditions or ambient concentrations of that pollutant; or

(iii) Increasing final exhaust gas plume rise by manipulating source process parameters, exhaust gas parameters, stack parameters, or combining exhaust gases from several existing stacks into one stack; or other selective handling of exhaust gas streams so as to increase the exhaust gas plume rise.

(2) The preceding sentence does not include:

(i) The reheating of a gas stream, following use of a pollution control system, for the purpose of returning the gas to the temperature at which it was originally discharged from the facility generating the gas stream;

(ii) The merging of exhaust gas streams where:

(A) The source owner or operator demonstrates that the facility was originally designed and constructed with such merged gas streams;
