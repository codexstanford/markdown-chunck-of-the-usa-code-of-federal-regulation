####### ITC recommendations and recommendations with intent to designate.

(a)The ITC has advised EPA that it will discharge its responsibilities under section 4(e) of TSCA in the following manner:

(1) When the ITC identifies a chemical substance or mixture that it believes should receive expedited consideration by EPA for testing, the ITC may add the substance or mixture to its list of chemicals recommended for testing and include a statement that the ITC intends to designate the substance or mixture for action by EPA in accordance with section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA.

(2) Chemical substances or mixtures selected for expedited review under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may, at a later time, be designated for EPA action within 12 months of such designation. The ITC's subsequent decision would be based on the ITC's review of TSCA sections 8(a) and 8(d) data and other relevant information.

(3) Where the ITC concludes that a chemical substance or mixture warrants testing consideration but that expedited EPA review of testing needs is not justified, the ITC will add the substance or mixture to its list of testing recommendations without expressing an intent to designate the substance or mixture for EPA action in accordance with section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA.

(4) The ITC reserves its right to designate any chemical substance or mixture that it determines the Agency should, within 12 months of the date first designated, initiate a proceeding under section 4(a) of TSCA.
