####### Extended Cookout (ECO)

means a control technique that reduces the amount of unreacted ethylene oxide (EO) and/or propylene oxide (PO) (epoxides) in the reactor. This is accomplished by allowing the product to react for a longer time period, thereby having less unreacted epoxides and reducing epoxides emissions that may have otherwise occurred.
