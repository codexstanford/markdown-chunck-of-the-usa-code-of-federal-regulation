####### Greenhouse gas compliance testing.

(s)Select duty cycles and measure emissions to demonstrate compliance with greenhouse gas emission standards before model year 2027 as follows:

(1) For model years 2016 through 2020, measure emissions using the FTP duty cycle specified in ยง 1036.512 and the SET duty cycle specified in 40 CFR 86.1362, as applicable.

(2) The following provisions apply for model years 2021 through 2026:

(i) Determine criteria pollutant emissions during any testing used to demonstrate compliance with greenhouse gas emission standards; however, the duty-cycle standards of ยง 1036.104 apply for measured criteria pollutant emissions only as described in subpart F of this part.

(ii) You may demonstrate compliance with SET-based greenhouse gas emission standards in ยง 1036.108(a)(1) using the SET duty cycle specified in 40 CFR 86.1362 if you collect emissions with continuous sampling. Integrate the test results by mode to establish separate emission rates for each mode (including the transition following each mode, as applicable). Apply the COweighting factors specified in 40 CFR 86.1362 to calculate a composite emission result.
