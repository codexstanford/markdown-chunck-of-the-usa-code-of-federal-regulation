####### ยง 63.3544 How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
######## Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.

(a)You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:

(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.

(2) All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system. For example, the criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
