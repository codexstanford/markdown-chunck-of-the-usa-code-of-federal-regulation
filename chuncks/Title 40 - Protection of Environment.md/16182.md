####### Alternatives to cross-examination.

(d)(1) No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request that alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as the submittal of additional written information) be used in lieu of or in addition to cross-examination. The Presiding Officer shall issue an order granting or denying such request at the time he issues (or would have issued) an order under paragraph (b) of this section. If the request is granted, the order shall specify the alternative provided and any other relevant information (e.g., the due date for submitting written information).

(2) In passing on any request for cross-examination submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer may, as a precondition to ruling on the merits of such request, require that alternative means of clarifying the record be used whether or not a request to do so has been made under the preceding paragraph. The person requesting cross-examination shall have one week to comment on the results of utilizing such alternative means, following which the Presiding Officer, as soon as practicable, shall issue an order granting or denying such person's request for cross-examination.
