####### Maintenance wastewater

means wastewater generated by the draining of process fluid from components in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit into an individual drain system in preparation for or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can generate maintenance wastewater include descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of pumps into an individual drain system, and draining of portions of the pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit for repair. Wastewater from cleaning operations is not considered maintenance wastewater.
