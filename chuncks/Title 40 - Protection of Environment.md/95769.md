####### Feeding.

(iii)(A) During the test the daphnids shall be fed the same diet and with the same frequency as that used for culturing and acclimation. All treatments and control(s) shall receive, as near as reasonably possible, the same ration of food on a per-animal basis.

(B) The food concentration depends on the type used. Food concentrations should be sufficient to support normal growth and development and to allow for asexual (parthenogenic) reproduction. For automatic feeding devices, a suggested rate is 5 to 7 mg food (either solids or algal cells, dry weight) per liter dilution water or test solution. For manual once-a-day feeding, a suggested rate is 15 mg food (dry weight) per liter dilution water or test solution.
