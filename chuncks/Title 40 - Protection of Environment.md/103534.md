####### ยง 1065.1127 Test procedure for determining percent opacity.

The test procedure described in this section applies for everything other than locomotives. The test consists of a sequence of engine operating points on an engine dynamometer to measure exhaust opacity during specific engine operating modes to represent in-use operation. Measure opacity using the following procedure:

(a) Use the equipment and procedures specified in this part 1065.

(b) Calibrate the smokemeter as follows:

(1) Calibrate using neutral density filters with approximately 10, 20, and 40 percent opacity. Confirm that the opacity values for each of these reference filters are NIST-traceable within 185 days of testing, or within 370 days of testing if you consistently protect the reference filters from light exposure between tests.

(2) Before each test and optionally during engine idle modes, remove the smokemeter from the exhaust stream, if applicable, and calibrate as follows:
