####### Genetic construction of the new microorganism.

(2)(i) Data substantiating the taxonomy of the donor organism(s). In lieu of data, EPA will accept a letter from a culture collection substantiating taxonomy, provided EPA, upon request to the submitter, may have access to the data supporting the taxonomic designation.

(ii) Description of the traits for which the new microorganism has been selected or developed and other traits known to have been added or modified.

(iii) A detailed description of the genetic construction of the new microorganism, including the technique used to modify the microorganism (e.g., fusion of cells, injection of DNA, electroporation or chemical poration, or methods used for induced mutation and selection). The description should include, for example, a description of the introduced genetic material, including any regulatory sequences and structural genes and the products of those genes; how the introduced genetic material is expected to affect behavior of the recipient; expression, alteration, and stability of the introduced genetic material; methods for vector construction and introduction; and a description of the regulatory and structural genes that are components of the introduced genetic material, including genetic maps of the introduced sequences.
