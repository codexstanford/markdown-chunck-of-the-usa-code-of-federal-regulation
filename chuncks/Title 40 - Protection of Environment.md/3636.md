(d)

(1) The Administrator will suspend the issuance of nonattainment major NSR permits under this program promptly upon publication of notice of approval of a TIP with a major NSR permit program for nonattainment areas.

(2) The Administrator may retain jurisdiction over the permits for which the administrative or judicial review process is not complete and will address this issue in the notice of program approval.

(3) After approval of a program for issuing nonattainment major NSR permits and the suspension of issuance of nonattainment major NSR permits by the Administrator, the Administrator will continue to administer nonattainment major NSR permits until permits are issued under the approved Tribal implementation plan program.

(4) Permits previously issued under this program will remain in effect and be enforceable as a practical matter until and unless the Tribe issues new permits to these sources based on the provisions of the EPA-approved Tribal implementation plan.
