####### Dilution water.

(iv)(A) Surface or ground water, reconstituted water, or dechlorinated tap water are acceptable as dilution water if daphnids will survive in it for the duration of the culturing, acclimation, and testing periods without showing signs of stress. The quality of the dilution water should be constant and should meet the following specificiations:

(B) The water quality characteristics listed above shall be measured at least twice a year or when it is suspected that these characteristics may have changed significantly. If dechlorinated tap water is used, daily chlorine analysis shall be performed.

(C) If the diluent water is from a ground or surface water source, conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) or chemical oxygen demand (COD) shall be measured. Reconstituted water can be made by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized or distilled water. Glass distilled or carbon filtered deionized water with a conductivity of less than 1 microohm/cm is acceptable as the diluent for making reconstituted water.

(D) If the test substance is not soluble in water an appropriate carrier should be used.
