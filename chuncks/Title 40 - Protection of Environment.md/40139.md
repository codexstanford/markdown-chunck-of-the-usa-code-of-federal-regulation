###### Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainty (FRU

8.1.4). The FRU is determined for each analyte by comparing CTS spectra taken before and after the reference spectra were measured. The EPA para-xylene reference spectra were collected on 10/31/91 and 11/01/91 with corresponding CTS spectra "cts1031a," and "cts1101b." The CTS spectra are used to estimate the reproducibility (FRU) in the system that was used to collect the references. The FRU must be <AU. Appendix E of the protocol is used to calculate the FRU from CTS spectra. Figure 2 plots results for 0.25 cmCTS spectra in EPA reference library: S(cts1101b-cts1031a), and S[(cts1101b + cts1031a)/2]. The RMSD (SRMS) is calculated in the subtracted baseline, S, in the corresponding CTS region from 850 to 1065 cm. The area (BAV) is calculated in the same region of the averaged CTS spectrum, S.
