(j)The refueling equipment shall consist of a fuel delivery system with temperature control equipment, fuel flow safety switch, dispensing pump, hose, nozzle and a meter to measure the dispensed fuel volume. The dispensing nozzle shall be a commercial model, not equipped with vapor recovery hardware. A fuel recirculation system may be utilized to avoid trapping of unheated fuel in the hose. The fuel delivery system must be capable of delivering fuel at 67+/-1.5 &#xB0;F (19.4+/-0.8 &#xB0;C) and a constant flow rate between 4.2 and 9.8 gal/min (15.9 and 37.1 liter/min) with a tolerance of +/-0.3 gal/min (+/-1.1 liter/min) during the refueling emissions measurement phase of the test. The accuracy of the meter for measuring the dispensed fuel volume shall be +/-2 percent at the test flow rate.
