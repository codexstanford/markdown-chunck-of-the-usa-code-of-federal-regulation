####### Fuel and other fluids.,m

(a)Determine the mass of fuel, DEF, and other carbon-carrying fluid streams, other than intake air, flowing into the system,, for each test interval. Note that ยง 1065.543 allows you to omit all flows other than fuel. You may determine the mass of DEF based on ECM signals for DEF flow rate. You may determine fuel mass during field testing based on ECM signals for fuel flow rate. Calculate the mass of carbon from the combined carbon-carrying fluid streams flowing into the system as follows:
