######### Missing data procedures.

(f)Except as provided in § 75.34, paragraph (g) of this section, and § 75.74(c)(7), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data from monitoring systems required under § 75.71 for each affected unit as follows:

(1) For an owner or operator using a continuous emissions monitoring system, substitute for missing data in accordance with the applicable missing data procedures in §§ 75.31 through 75.37 whenever the unit combusts fuel and:

(i) A valid, quality-assured hour of NOemission rate data (in lb/mmBtu) has not been measured and recorded for a unit by a certified NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system or by an approved monitoring system under subpart E of this part;

(ii) A valid, quality-assured hour of flow data (in scfh) has not been measured and recorded for a unit from a certified flow monitor or by an approved alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part;

(iii) A valid, quality-assured hour of heat input rate data (in mmBtu/hr) has not been measured and recorded for a unit from a certified flow monitor and a certified diluent (COor O) monitor or by an approved alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part, where heat input is required either for calculating NOmass or allocating allowances under the applicable State or federal NOmass emission reduction program that adopts the requirements of this subpart;

(iv) A valid, quality-assured hour of NOconcentration data (in ppm) has not been measured and recorded by a certified NOconcentration monitoring system, or by an approved alternative monitoring method under subpart E of this part, where the owner or operator chooses to use a NOconcentration monitoring system with a flow monitor, to calculate NOmass emissions. The initial missing data procedures for determining monitor data availability and the standard missing data procedures for a NOconcentration monitoring system shall be the same as the procedures specified for a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system under §§ 75.31, 75.32, and 75.33; or

(v) A valid, quality-assured hour of moisture data (in percent HO) has not been measured or recorded for an affected unit, either by a certified moisture monitoring system or an approved alternative monitoring method under subpart E of this part. This requirement does not apply when a default percent moisture value, as provided in § 75.11(b) or § 75.12(b), is used to account for the hourly moisture content of the stack gas.

(2) For an owner or operator using an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E of this part, substitute for missing data in accordance with the missing data procedures in section 2.4 of appendix D to this part or in section 2.5 of appendix E to this part whenever the unit combusts fuel and:

(i) A valid, quality-assured hour of fuel flow rate data has not been measured and recorded by a certified fuel flowmeter that is part of an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E of this part; or

(ii) A fuel sample value for gross calorific value, or if necessary, density or specific gravity, from a sample taken an analyzed in accordance with appendix D of this part is not available; or

(iii) A valid, quality-assured hour of NOemission rate data has not been obtained according to the procedures and specifications of appendix E to this part.
