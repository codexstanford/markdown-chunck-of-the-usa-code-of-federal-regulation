######## Lime injection.

(p)The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a lime-injected fabric filter system must use these procedures during the HCl and D/F tests to establish an operating parameter value for the feeder setting for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test.

(1) For continuous lime injection systems, ensure that lime in the feed hopper or silo is free-flowing at all times; and

(2) Record the feeder setting and lime injection rate for the 3 test runs. If the feed rate setting and lime injection rates vary between the runs, determine and record the average feed rate and lime injection rate from the 3 runs.
