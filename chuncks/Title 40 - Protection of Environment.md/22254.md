###### 12.1 Concentration Correction for CO,Removal.

Correct the CO concentration for COremoval (if applicable) using Eq. 10-1.

The specifications for analyzer calibration error, system bias, drift, interference check, and alternative dynamic spike procedure are the same as in section 13.0 of Method 7E.

The dynamic spike procedure and the manufacturer stability test are the same as in sections 16.1 and 16.3 of Method 7E

1.1 Analytes.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of CO emissions at petroleum refineries. This method serves as the reference method in the relative accuracy test for nondispersive infrared (NDIR) CO continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are required to be installed in petroleum refineries on fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators (ยง 60.105(a)(2) of this part).

1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
