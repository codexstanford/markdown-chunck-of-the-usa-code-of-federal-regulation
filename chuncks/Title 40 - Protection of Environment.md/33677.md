####### § 63.2485 What requirements must I meet for wastewater streams and liquid streams in open systems within an MCPU?
######## Wastewater tank requirements.

(d)(1) When §§ 63.133 and 63.147 reference floating roof requirements in §§ 63.119 and 63.120, the corresponding requirements in subpart WW of this part 63 may be applied for the purposes of this subpart.

(2) When § 63.133(a) refers to table 10 of subpart G of this part 63, the maximum true vapor pressure in the table shall be limited to the HAP listed in tables 8 and 9 of this subpart FFFF.

(3) For the purposes of this subpart, the requirements of § 63.133(a)(2) are satisfied by operating and maintaining a fixed roof if you demonstrate that the total soluble and partially soluble HAP emissions from the wastewater tank are no more than 5 percent higher than the emissions would be if the contents of the wastewater tank were not heated, treated by an exothermic reaction, or sparged.

(4) The emission limits specified in §§ 63.133(b)(2) and 63.139 for control devices used to control emissions from wastewater tanks do not apply during periods of planned routine maintenance of the control device(s) of no more than 240 hr/yr. You may request an extension to a total of 360 hr/yr in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.2470(d).
