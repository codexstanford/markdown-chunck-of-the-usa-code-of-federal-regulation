######## Accelerated aging.

(d)Following zero-hour emission testing and any engine dynamometer aging, perform accelerated aging using the cycle validated in either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. Repeat the cycle the number of times required to reach full useful life equivalent aging. Interrupt the aging cycle as needed to conduct any scheduled intermediate emission tests, clean the DPF of accumulated ash, and for any facility releated reasons. We recommended you interrupt aging at the end of a given aging cycle, following the completion of any scheduled infrequent regeneration event.
