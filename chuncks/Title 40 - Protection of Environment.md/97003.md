####### i,Dose levels.

()Normally, three dose levels shall be used. The highest dose shall produce signs of toxicity (e.g., slightly reduced fertility and slightly reduced body weight). The highest dose should not exceed the lower explosive limit of commercial hexane. However, in an initial assessment of dominant lethality, a single high dose may be sufficient. Nontoxic substances shall be tested at 5 g/kg or, if this is not practicable, then at the highest dose attainable.
