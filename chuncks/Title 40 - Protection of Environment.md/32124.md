###### ยง 63.1402 Definitions.
####### Solvent-based resin

means an amino/phenolic resin that consumes a solvent (i.e., methanol, xylene) as a reactant in the resin producing reaction. The use of a solvent as a carrier (i.e., adding methanol to the product/water solution after the reaction is complete) does not meet this definition.
