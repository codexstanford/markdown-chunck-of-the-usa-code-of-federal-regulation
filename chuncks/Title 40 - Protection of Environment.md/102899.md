####### ยง 1065.390 PM balance verifications and weighing process verification.
######## Zeroing and spanning.

(c)You must verify balance performance by zeroing and spanning it with at least one calibration weight. Also, any external weights you use must meet the specifications in ยง 1065.790. Any weights internal to the PM balance used for this verification must be verified as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

(1) Use a manual procedure in which you zero the balance and span the balance with at least one calibration weight. If you normally use mean values by repeating the weighing process to improve the accuracy and precision of PM measurements, use the same process to verify balance performance.

(2) You may use an automated procedure to verify balance performance. For example most balances have internal weights for automatically verifying balance performance.
