(2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner may elect to determine compliance by using the CEMS specified under § 60.49Da for measuring NOand oxygen (O) (or carbon dioxide (CO)) and meet the requirements of § 60.49Da. Alternatively, data from a NOemission rate (, NO-diluent) CEMS certified according to the provisions of § 75.20(c) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and meeting the quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, may be used, with the following caveats.

The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The NOemission rate at the outlet from the steam generating unit shall constitute the NOemission rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle system.
