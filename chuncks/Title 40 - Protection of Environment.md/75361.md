###### Chromium Drag-out Destruction

is a unit operation performed following chromium-bearing operations to reduce hexavalent chromium that is "dragged out" of the process bath. Parts are dipped in a solution of a chromium-reducing chemical (e.g., sodium metabisulfite) to prevent the hexavalent chromium from contaminating subsequent process baths. This operation typically is performed in a stagnant drag-out rinse tank that contains concentrated chromium-bearing wastewater.
