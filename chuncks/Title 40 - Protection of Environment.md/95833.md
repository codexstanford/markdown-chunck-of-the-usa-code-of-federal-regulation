###### ยง 797.1600 Fish early life stage toxicity test.
####### Range-finding test.

(3)(i) A range finding test is normally performed with the test substance to determine the test concentrations to be used in the early life stage toxicity test, especially when the toxicity is unknown. It is recommended that the test substance concentrations be selected based on information gained from a 4- to 10-day flow-through toxicity test with juveniles of the selected test species.

(ii) The highest concentration selected for the early life stage toxicity test should approximate the lowest concentration indicated in any previous testing to cause a significant reduction in survival. The range of concentrations selected is expected to include both observed effect and no-observed effect levels. The dilution factor between concentrations is normally 0.50, however, other dilution factors may be used as necessary.
