(1) For nonmethane cutters, calculate &#x3C7;using the nonmethane cutter's methane penetration fraction,, and the ethane response factor penetration fraction,, from § 1065.365, the THC FID's methane response factor,, from § 1065.360, the initial THC contamination and dry-to-wet corrected THC concentration, &#x3C7;, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section, and the dry-to-wet corrected methane concentration, &#x3C7;, optionally corrected for initial THC contamination as determined in paragraph (a) of this section.

(i) If you need to account for penetration fractions determined as a function of molar water concentration, use Eq. 1065.660-11. Otherwise, use the following equation for penetration fractions determined using an NMC configuration as outlined in § 1065.365(d):

(ii) Use the following equation for penetration fractions determined using an NMC configuration as outlined in § 1065.365(e):

(iii) Use the following equation for penetration fractions determined using an NMC configuration as outlined in § 1065.365(f) or for penetration fractions determined as a function of molar water concentration using an NMC configuration as outlined in § 1065.365(d):

(2) For a GC-FID or FTIR, &#x3C7;is the actual dry-to-wet corrected methane concentration as measured by the analyzer.
