###### 30-Minute and 1-Hour Sampling.

9.2Place 10 mL of TCM absorbing reagent in a midget impinger and seal the impinger with a thin film of silicon stopcock grease (around the ground glass joint). Insert the sealed impinger into the sampling train as shown in Figure 1, making sure that all connections between the various components are leak tight. Greaseless ball joint fittings, heat shrinkable Teflon &#xAE; tubing, or Teflon &#xAE; tube fittings may be used to attain leakfree conditions for portions of the sampling train that come into contact with air containing SO. Shield the absorbing reagent from direct sunlight by covering the impinger with aluminum foil or by enclosing the sampling train in a light-proof box. Determine the flow rate according to Section 9.4.2. Collect the sample at 1 +/-0.10 L/min for 30-minute sampling or 0.500 +/-0.05 L/min for 1-hour sampling. Record the exact sampling time in minutes, as the sample volume will later be determined using the sampling flow rate and the sampling time. Record the atmospheric pressure and temperature.
