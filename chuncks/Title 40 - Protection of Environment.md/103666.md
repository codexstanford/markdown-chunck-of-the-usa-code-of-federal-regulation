####### SSV calibration.,C

(g)Calibrate each subsonic venturi (SSV) to determine its discharge coefficient,, for the expected range of inlet pressures. Calibrate an SSV flow meter as follows:

(1) Configure your calibration system as shown in Figure 1 of this section.

(2) Verify that any leaks between the calibration flow meter and the SSV are less than 0.3% of the total flow at the highest restriction.

(3) Start the blower downstream of the SSV.
