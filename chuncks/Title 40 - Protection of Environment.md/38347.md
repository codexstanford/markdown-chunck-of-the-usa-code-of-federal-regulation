5.1.2.4 The test frequency for the RATAs of the Hg CEMS shall be annual,once every four QA operating quarters. For units that operate infrequently, extensions of RATA deadlines are allowed for non-QA operating quarters. Following a RATA, if there is a subsequent non-QA quarter, it extends the deadline for the next test by one calendar quarter. However, there is a limit to these extensions; the deadline may not be extended beyond the end of the eighth calendar quarter after the quarter of the last test. At that point, a RATA must either be performed within the eighth calendar quarter or in a 720 hour unit or stack operating hour grace period following that quarter. When a required annual RATA is done within a grace period, the deadline for the next RATA is three QA operating quarters after the quarter in which the grace period test is performed.
