######## Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60.,see

(ii)You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. As an alternative to using Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (R2015), "Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings" (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14). For a multi-component coating with reactive chemicals, you may use Method 24 or ASTM D2369-10 (R2015) on the coating as applied to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for the mass fraction of organic HAP determined from the sum of organic HAP in each component.
