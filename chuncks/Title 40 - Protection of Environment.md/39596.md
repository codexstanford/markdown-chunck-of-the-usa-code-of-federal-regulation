######## i.e.,

(i) For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves during the number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance test by the sum of the total amount of gold mine ore processed (in million tons) in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. Or, if a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (million tons of ore) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per million tons of ore.
