####### Paper

means one of two broad subdivisions of paper products, the other being paperboard. Paper is generally lighter in basis weight, thinner, and more flexible than paperboard. Sheets 0.012 inch or less in thickness are generally classified as paper. Its primary uses are for printing, writing, wrapping, and sanitary purposes. However, in this guideline, the term paper is also used as a generic term that includes both paper and paperboard.
