The message on the water bill must include the following statement exactly as written except for the text in brackets for which the water system must include system-specific information: [INSERT NAME OF WATER SYSTEM] found high levels of lead in drinking water in some homes. Lead can cause serious health problems. For more information please call [INSERT NAME OF WATER SYSTEM] [or visit (INSERT YOUR WEB SITE HERE)]. The message or delivery mechanism can be modified in consultation with the State; specifically, the State may allow a separate mailing of public education materials to customers if the water system cannot place the information on water bills.

(3) As long as a community water system exceeds the action level, it must repeat the activities pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(i) A community water system shall repeat the tasks contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) and (vi) of this section every 12 months.

(iv) The community water system shall repeat the task in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section twice every 12 months on a schedule agreed upon with the State. The State can allow activities in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to extend beyond the 60-day requirement if needed for implementation purposes on a case-by-case basis; however, this extension must be approved in writing by the State in advance of the 60-day deadline.

(4) Within 60 days after the end of the tap sampling period in which the exceedance occurred (unless it already is repeating public education tasks pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section), a non-transient non-community water system shall deliver the public education materials specified by paragraph (a) of this section as follows:

(i) Post informational posters on lead in drinking water in a public place or common area in each of the buildings served by the system; and

(ii) Distribute informational pamphlets and/or brochures on lead in drinking water to each person served by the non-transient non-community water system. The State may allow the system to utilize electronic transmission in lieu of or combined with printed materials as long as it achieves at least the same coverage.

(iii) For systems that are required to conduct monitoring annually or less frequently, the end of the tap sampling period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or, if the State has established an alternate tap sampling period, the last day of that period.

(5) A non-transient non-community water system shall repeat the tasks contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section at least once during each calendar year in which the system exceeds the lead action level. The State can allow activities in (b)(4) of this section to extend beyond the 60-day requirement if needed for implementation purposes on a case-by-case basis; however, this extension must be approved in writing by the State in advance of the 60-day deadline.

(6) A water system may discontinue delivery of public education materials if the system is at or below the lead action level during the most recent six-month tap sampling monitoring period conducted pursuant to ยง 141.86. Such a system shall recommence public education in accordance with this section if it subsequently exceeds the lead action level during any tap sampling period.

(7) A community water system may apply to the State, in writing (unless the State has waived the requirement for prior State approval), to use only the text specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in lieu of the text in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section and to perform the tasks listed in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section in lieu of the tasks in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section if:

(i) The system is a facility, such as a prison or a hospital, where the population served is not capable of or is prevented from making improvements to plumbing or installing point of use treatment devices; and

(ii) The system provides water as part of the cost of services provided and does not separately charge for water consumption.

(ii) With respect to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, a system serving 3,300 or fewer people may limit the distribution of the public education materials required under that paragraph to facilities and organizations served by the system that are most likely to be visited regularly by pregnant women and children.

(iii) With respect to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the State may waive this requirement for systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons as long as system distributes notices to every household served by the system.
