####### Nuclear coating

means a protective coating formulated and recommended to seal porous surfaces such as steel (or concrete) that otherwise would be subject to intrusion by radioactive materials. These coatings must be resistant to long-term (service life) cumulative radiation exposure (ASTM Method D 4082-89, Standard Test Method for Effects of Gamma Radiation on Coatings for Use in Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants (incorporated by reference-see ยง 59.412 of this subpart)), relatively easy to decontaminate, and resistant to various chemicals to which the coatings are likely to be exposed (ASTM Method D 3912-80 (Reapproved 1989), Standard Test Method for Chemical Resistance of Coatings Used in Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants (incorporated by reference-see ยง 59.412 of this subpart)).
