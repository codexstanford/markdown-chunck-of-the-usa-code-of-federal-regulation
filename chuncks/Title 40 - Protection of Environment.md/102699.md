########## Application.

(a)You may use a paramagnetic detection (PMD) or magnetopneumatic detection (MPD) analyzer to measure Oconcentration in raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling. You may use good engineering judgment to develop calculations that use Omeasurements with a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust to calculate exhaust flow rate.
