###### ยง 75.24 Out-of-control periods and adjustment for system bias.

(a) If an out-of-control period occurs to a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system, the owner or operator shall take corrective action and repeat the tests applicable to the "out-of-control parameter" as described in appendix B of this part.

(1) For daily calibration error tests, an out-of-control period occurs when the calibration error of a pollutant concentration monitor exceeds the applicable specification in section 2.1.4 of appendix B to this part.

(2) For quarterly linearity checks, an out-of-control period occurs when the error in linearity at any of three gas concentrations (low, mid-range, and high) exceeds the applicable specification in appendix A to this part.

(3) For relative accuracy test audits, an out-of-control period occurs when the relative accuracy exceeds the applicable specification in appendix A to this part.

(b) When a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system is out-of-control, any data recorded by the monitor or monitoring system are not quality-assured and shall not be used in calculating monitor data availabilities pursuant to ยง 75.32 of this part.

(c) When a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system is out-of-control, the owner or operator shall take one of the following actions until the monitor or monitoring system has successfully met the relevant criteria in appendices A and B of this part as demonstrated by subsequent tests:

(1) Apply the procedures for missing data substitution to emissions from affected unit(s); or

(2) Use a certified backup monitoring system or a reference method for measuring and recording emissions from the affected unit(s); or

(3) Adjust the gas discharge paths from the affected unit(s) with emissions normally observed by the out-of-control monitor or monitoring system so that all exhaust gases are monitored by a certified monitor or monitoring system meeting the requirements of appendices A and B of this part.
