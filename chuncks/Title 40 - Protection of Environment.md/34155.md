######## Bake oven air seal

means an entry or entry vestibule to or an exit or exit vestibule from a bake oven which isolates the bake oven from the area immediately preceding (for an entry or entry vestibule) or immediately following (for an exit or exit vestibule) the bake oven. No significant VOC generating activity takes place in a bake oven air seal. Fresh air is supplied into a bake oven air seal and is then directed in part into the bake oven and in part into the area immediately preceding or immediately following the bake oven. All types of bake ovens, including ovens associated with spray booths and electrodeposition primer bake ovens, may have bake oven air seals.
