####### How to format a Notification.

(c)A Notification submitted under this section must comply with the following procedures, but is not required to comply with the format and other provisions governing submission of data in §§ 158.32 and 158.33 or §§ 161.32 and 161.33 of this chapter.

(2) Five copies of each Notification must be submitted to EPA.
