(2)If your normalized duty cycle specifies speeds as A, B, C, or D values, use your power-versus-speed curve to determine the lowest speed below maximum power at which 50% of maximum power occurs. Denote this value asTaketo be warm idle speed if all power points at speeds below the maximum power speed are higher than 50% of maximum power. Also determine the highest speed above maximum power at which 70% of maximum power occurs. Denote this value asIf all power points at speeds above the maximum power speed are higher than 70% of maximum power, taketo be the declared maximum safe engine speed or the declared maximum representative engine speed, whichever is lower. Useandto calculate reference values for A, B, C, or D speeds as follows:
