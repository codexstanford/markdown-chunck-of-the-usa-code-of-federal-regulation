####### Warranty period.

(b)(1) Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least:

(i) 5 years or 50,000 miles for Light HDV (except tires).

(ii) 5 years or 100,000 miles for Medium HDV and Heavy HDV (except tires).

(iii) 5 years for trailers (except tires).

(iv) 1 year for tires installed on trailers, and 2 years or 24,000 miles for all other tires.

(2) You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the vehicle may not be shorter than any basic mechanical warranty you provide to that owner without charge for the vehicle. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any warranty you provide to that owner without charge for that component. This means that your warranty for a given vehicle may not treat emission-related and nonemission-related defects differently for any component. The warranty period begins when the vehicle is placed into service.
