####### NMOG standard adjustment for direct ozone reducing devices.

(r)(1) A manufacturer may obtain NMOG credit for use in certifying to the exhaust NMOG standards listed in paragraph (c) of this section and for use in complying with the in-use standards of paragraph (p) of this section, where applicable. This credit effectively allows the manufacturer to increase the exhaust NMOG emission standards listed in these paragraphs by the amount of the applicable credit. For example, if the applicable NMOG credit was 0.01 g/mi, and the vehicle was being certified in Bin 5, as described in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this section, exhaust NMOG emissions must be no greater than 0.10 g/mi, as opposed to the normal NMOG certification standard of 0.09 g/mi in Bin 5.

(2) The NMOG credit must be determined through a two-step process.

(i) The first step must determine the ozone reduction potential of the direct ozone reducing device, the ozone reduction potential of exhaust NMOG reductions beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards, and the ratio of the two methods of reducing ambient ozone levels. The requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(3) of this section.

(ii) The second step must demonstrate and certify the relevant performance characteristics of the specific ozone reducing device. The requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(4) of this section.

(3) The ozone reduction potential of the direct ozone reducing device and the ozone reduction potential of exhaust NMOG reductions beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards must be estimated using procedures which are approved by the Administrator in advance. At a minimum:

(i) The modeling must utilize an urban airshed model using up-to-date chemical and meteorological simulation techniques;

(ii) Four local areas must be modeled: New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and Houston;

(iii) The ozone episodes to be modeled must meet the selection criteria established by EPA for State ozone SIPs;

(iv) Photochemical and dispersion modeling must follow that used by EPA to project the ozone impacts of this rule, or its equivalent;

(v) Emission projections must be made for calendar year 2007 and be consistent with those used by EPA in support of this final rule, or reflect updates approved by EPA;

(vi) Baseline emissions (emissions prior to use of the direct ozone reducing device or the VOC emission reductions) must include the benefits of the Tier 2 emission and sulfur standards; as well as all other emission controls assumed in EPA's ozone modeling of the benefits of the Tier 2 and sulfur standards, as described in the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis to the Tier 2 and Sulfur Rule;

(vii) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must assume a radiator area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity through the radiator of 40% of vehicle speed, and an ozone reduction efficiency of 80%, or other values as approved by the Administrator;

(viii) The ozone level of the air entering the direct ozone reducing device must be assumed to be 40% less than that existing in the grid cell where the vehicle is located;

(ix) The ozone benefit of VOC emission reductions must be modeled by assuming that all Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs meet an exhaust NMOG standard of 0.055 g/mi or lower instead of a 0.09 g/mi NMOG standard;

(x) The ozone reducing device must be assumed to be present on all of the Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs modeled as meeting the more stringent NMOG standard described in paragraph (r)(3)(ix) of this section;

(xi) The relationship between changes in exhaust NMOG emission standards and in-use VOC emissions must be determined sufficiently far in the future to ensure that the change in ozone being modeled is sufficiently large to allow comparison with the impact of the ozone reducing device;

(xii) LDV, LDT and MDPV emissions must be modeled using the updated Tier 2 emission model developed by EPA as part of the Tier 2 rulemaking (available from EPA upon request) or MOBILE6, once this model is available;

(xiii) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must be the reduction in the peak one-hour ozone level anywhere in the modeled region on the day when ozone is at its highest;

(xiv) The NMOG credit in each local area must be the reduction in peak one hour ozone associated with use of the direct ozone reducing device divided by the reduction in peak one hour ozone associated with the more stringent exhaust NMOG emission standard multiplied by the reduction the exhaust NMOG standard (in g/mi) modeled in paragraph (r)(3)(ix) of this section; and

(xv) The NMOG credit applicable to the generic direct ozone reducing device modeled in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section must be determined by arithmetically averaging the NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xiv) of this section for each of the four local areas.

(4) The manufacturer must submit data, using procedures which have been approved by the Administrator in advance, that demonstrate the following aspects of the device being certified:

(i) The air flowrate through the device as a function of vehicle speed;

(ii) The ozone reduction efficiency of the device over the useful life of the vehicle for a range of vehicle speeds and ozone levels;

(iii) The method through which the onboard diagnostic system will detect improper performance.

(5) The NMOG credit for the specific application of this technology tested under the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section is the four-area NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section scaled based on the performance of the specific application tested under the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section relative to those assumed in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section. This scaling must assume a linear relationship between the NMOG credit and three aspects of the direct ozone reducing device: radiator area, average air flow through the radiator relative to vehicle speed, and ozone reduction efficiency and the NMOG credit. The NMOG credit must be rounded to the nearest 0.001 g/mi. For example, if the NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section was 0.01 g/mi and the specific direct ozone reducing device being certified had an area of 0.20 square meters, an air flow velocity of 30% of vehicle speed and an ozone reducing efficiency of 70%, and the generic ozone reducing device simulated in the ozone model under paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section had an area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity of 40% of vehicle speed and an ozone reducing efficiency of 80%, the NMOG credit applicable to the specific device being certified would be:

(s) Manufacturers may request to group heavy-duty vehicles into the same test group as other vehicles subject to more stringent standards, so long as all vehicles in the test group meet the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group, as provided at ยง 86.1827-1(a)(5) and (d)(4).
