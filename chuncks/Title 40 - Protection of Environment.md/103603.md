######## Final cycle validation.,D,D,D,D,D

(ii)Once the cycle is tuned, conduct a final run using the target aftertreatment system to verify conditions and log temperatures for heat load calculation. Using the recorded cycle data, calculatefor all primary component catalysts to ensure that you are matching the desiredtargets. If you are not within +/-3% of the targetadjust the cycle accordingly. Calculatefor any secondary catalyst components to verify that they are within +/-3% of either the targetor the target aging metric. Note that the accelerated aging methodology assumes that the relationship between the temperature of the primary and secondary catalyst components will the be same as the field observations. If this relationship deviates in the lab by having more or less heat transfer through the system, it may be necessary to modify that relationship on the aging stand. You may need to take measures such as adding or removing insulation or utilize external cooling fans to help these parameters match more closely.
