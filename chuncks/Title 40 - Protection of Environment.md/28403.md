(2) For each paste production plant, the owner or operator shall measure and record the emission rate of PM exiting the exhaust stacks(s) of the primary emission control system. Using the equation in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the owner or operator shall compute and record the average of at least three runs each year to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits for PM. Compliance with the PM standards for existing and new paste production plants is demonstrated when the PM emission rates are less than or equal to the applicable PM emission limits in §§ 63.843(b)(4) and 63.844(b)(2).
