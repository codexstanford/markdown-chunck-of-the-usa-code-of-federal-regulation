####### Range-finding test.

(3)(i) A range-finding test should be conducted to determine:

(A) If definitive testing is necessary.

(B) Test chemical concentrations for the definitive test.

(ii) Algae are exposed to a widely spaced (e.g., log interval) chemical concentration series. The lowest value in the series, exclusive of controls, should be at the chemical's detection limit. The upper value, for water soluble compounds, should be the saturation concentration. No replicates are required; and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable unless definitive testing is not required.
