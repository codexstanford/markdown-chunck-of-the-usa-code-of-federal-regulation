###### QA Spike.

8.6.2This procedure assumes that the method has been validated for at least some of the target analytes at the source. For emissions testing perform a QA spike. Use a certified standard, if possible, of an analyte, which has been validated at the source. One analyte standard can serve as a QA surrogate for other analytes which are less reactive or less soluble than the standard. Perform the spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method. Record spectra of at least three independent (section 3.22 of this method) spiked samples. Calculate the spiked component of the analyte concentration. If the average spiked concentration is within 0.7 to 1.3 times the expected concentration, then proceed with the testing. If applicable, apply the correction factor from the Method 301 of this appendix validation test (not the result from the QA spike).
