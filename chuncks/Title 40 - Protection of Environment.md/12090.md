####### Determination of attainment.

(jj)On June 5, 2009, the state of Indiana requested that EPA find that the Indiana portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, Illinois-Indiana (IL-IN) ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). After review of Indiana's submission and 2006-2008 ozone air quality data for this ozone nonattainment area, EPA finds that the entire Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. Therefore, EPA has determined, as of March 12, 2010, that Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties, and portions of Grundy County (Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships) and Kendall County (Oswego Township) in Illinois have attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.
