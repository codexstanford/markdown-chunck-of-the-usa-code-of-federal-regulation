####### e.g.

YUS06 = Calculated mass emissions per mile, using the summed mass emissions of the "US06 City" phase and the "US06 Highway" phase, based on the measured driving distance of the US06 test schedule. The "US06 City" phase shall be sampled during seconds 0-130 and from 495 seconds until five seconds after the engine stops running (602 or 603 seconds) of the US06 driving schedule. The "US06 Highway" phase shall be sampled during seconds 130-495 of the US06 driving schedule),

(ii) Composite (NMHC + NO) = Y(NMHC) + Y(NO)

Where:

(A) Y(NMHC) = results of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for NMHC.

(B) Y(NO) = results of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for NO.

(d) The NOhumidity correction factor for adjusting NOtest results to the environmental test cell air conditioning ambient condition of 100 grains of water/pound of dry air is:
