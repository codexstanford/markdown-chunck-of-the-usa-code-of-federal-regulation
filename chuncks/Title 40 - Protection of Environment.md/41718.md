(c)To be found complete, an application must provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, except for the information on post-reduction emissions required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Applications for permit revision need supply the information required under paragraph (e) of this section only if it is related to the proposed change. Information submitted under paragraph (e) of this section must be sufficient to allow the Administrator to determine if the early reductions source meets the applicable requirements of subpart D of part 63 of this chapter. Unless the Administrator determines that an application is not complete within 45 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed to be complete, except as otherwise provided in ยง 71.26(a)(3). If, while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to be complete, the Administrator determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or take final action on that application, the Administrator may request such information in writing and set a reasonable deadline for a response.
