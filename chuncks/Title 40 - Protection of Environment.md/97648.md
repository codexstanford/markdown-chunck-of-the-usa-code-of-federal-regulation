####### Data and reporting,Test report.

(d)-(1)(i) For each set of conditions, (e.g., temperature, pure water, buffer solution, artificial seawater) required for the study, provide the water solubility value for each of three determinations, the mean value, and the standard deviation.

(ii) For compounds that decompose at a rate such that a precise value for the water solubility cannot be obtained, provide a statement to that effect.

(iii) For compounds with water solubility below 1 ppb, report the value as "less than 1 ppb."
