####### Monitoring conditions for output components/systems.

(v)(A) The OBD system must monitor output components/systems continuously for circuit continuity and circuit malfunctions. The manufacturer may disable continuous monitoring for circuit continuity and circuit malfunctions when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that a properly functioning output component/system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning one and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false malfunction detection.

(B) For output component/system functional checks, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Specifically for the idle control system, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that functional checks must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
