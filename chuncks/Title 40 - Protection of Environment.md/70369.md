- For a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901determine its mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:

- For a RCRA hazardous waste that exhibits the characteristics identified under section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, determine its mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:

Based on this mass, designated as C, assign a value for hazardous constituent quantity as follows:

- For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous constituent quantity using the Tier A equation of Table 2-5.

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value using the Tier A equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-subsurface intrusion component, assign the area of observed exposure a value using the Tier A equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).

If the hazardous constituent quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) is adequately determined (that is, the total mass of all CERCLA hazardous substances in the source and releases from the source [or in the area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure] is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence), do not evaluate the other three measures discussed below. Instead assign these other three measures a value of 0 for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5.

If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined, assign the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) a value for hazardous constituent quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.2.
