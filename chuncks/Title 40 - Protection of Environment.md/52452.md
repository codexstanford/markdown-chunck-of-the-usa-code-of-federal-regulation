####### Flow to storage tank direct from non-separator equipment.

(iii)Calculate CHand COemissions using either of the methods in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.

(A) If other non-separator equipment liquid and gas compositions are available through a previous analysis, select the latest available analysis that is representative of liquid and gas from non-separator equipment in the same county and assume all of the CHand COin both hydrocarbon liquids and gas are emitted from the tank.

(B) If non-separator equipment liquid and gas compositions are not available, use default liquid and gas compositions in software programs, such as API 4697 E&P Tank, that most closely match the non-separator equipment gas/liquid ratio and API gravity and assume all of the CHand COin both hydrocarbon liquids and gas are emitted from the tank.
