Colorado's procedural rules govern all procedures and hearings before the Air Quality Control Commission (Commission) and certain procedures and hearings before the Air Pollution Control Division within the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The revision to the Commission's procedural rules was intended to bring the Commission current with all applicable procedural requirements for their official actions. The submitted portion of the revision consisted of changes to Section 1.11.0 of the procedural rules. The section addresses requirements under section 128 of the CAA regarding the composition of the Commission and disclosure by its members of potential conflicts of interest.
