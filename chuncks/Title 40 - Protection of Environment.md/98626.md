() The test should be designed to have a predetermined sensitivity and power. The number of cells, cultures, and concentrations of test substance used should reflect these defined parameters. The parameters discussed in the reference under paragraph (g)(13) of this section may be used. The minimal number of viable cells surviving treatment and used at each stage in the test should be based on the spontaneous mutation frequency. A general guide is to use a cell number which is at least ten times the inverse of the spontaneous mutation frequency. However, it is recommended to utilize at least 10cells. Adequate historical data on the cell system used should be available to indicate consistent performance of the test.
