####### Remote reservoir continuous web cleaning machine

means a continuous web cleaning machine in which there is no exposed solvent sump. In these units, the solvent is pumped from an enclosed chamber and is typically applied to the continuous web part through a nozzle or series of nozzles. The solvent then drains from the part and is collected and recycled through the machine, allowing no solvent to pool in the work or cleaning area.
