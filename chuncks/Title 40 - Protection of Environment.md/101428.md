###### ยง 1045.605 What provisions apply to engines already certified under the motor vehicle or Large SI programs?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new propulsion marine engines into U.S. commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to spark-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or part 1048 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1045 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1045.
