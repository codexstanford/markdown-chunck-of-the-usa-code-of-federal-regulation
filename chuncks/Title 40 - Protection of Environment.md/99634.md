###### ยง 1036.125 Maintenance instructions and allowable maintenance.
####### Special maintenance.

(c)You may specify more frequent maintenance to address problems related to special situations, such as atypical engine operation. For example, you may specify more frequent maintenance if operators fuel the engine with an alternative fuel such as biodiesel. You must clearly state that this special maintenance is associated with the special situation you are addressing. We may disapprove your maintenance instructions if we determine that you have specified special maintenance steps to address engine operation that is not atypical, or that the maintenance is unlikely to occur in use. If we determine that certain maintenance items do not qualify as special maintenance under this paragraph (c), you may identify them as recommended additional maintenance under paragraph (b) of this section.
