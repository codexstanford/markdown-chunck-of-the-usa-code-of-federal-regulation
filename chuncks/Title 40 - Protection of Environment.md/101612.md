###### ยง 1048.110 How must my engines diagnose malfunctions?
####### Use a malfunction-indicator light (MIL).

(b)The MIL must be readily visible to the operator; it may be any color except red. When the MIL goes on, it must display "Check Engine," "Service Engine Soon," or a similar message that we approve. You may use sound in addition to the light signal. The MIL must go on under each of the following circumstances:

(1) When a malfunction occurs, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) When the diagnostic system cannot send signals to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) When the engine's ignition is in the "key-on" position before starting or cranking. The MIL should go out after engine starting if the system detects no malfunction.
