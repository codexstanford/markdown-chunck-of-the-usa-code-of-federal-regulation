(a) The project will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner.

(b) In addition to the notification of project changes required pursuant to 2 CFR 200.308, prior written approval by the grants officer is required for project changes which may alter the approved scope of the project, substantially alter the design of the project, or increase the amount of Federal funds needed to complete the project. No approval or disapproval of a project change pursuant to 2 CFR 200.308 or this section shall commit or obligate the United States to an increase in the amount of the grant or payments thereunder, but shall not preclude submission or consideration of a request for a grant amendment pursuant to 2 CFR 200.308.
