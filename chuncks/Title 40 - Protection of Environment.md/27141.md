####### Vapor tightness test documentation for marine tank vessels.

(i)The owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain a documentation file for each marine tank vessel loaded at that source to reflect current test results as determined by the appropriate method in § 63.565(c)(1) and (2). Updates to this documentation file shall be made at least once per year. The owner or operator shall include, as a minimum, the following information in this documentation:

(1) Test title;

(2) Marine vessel owner and address;

(3) Marine vessel identification number;

(4) Loading time, according to § 63.563(a)(4)(ii) or (iii), if appropriate;

(5) Testing location;

(6) Date of test;

(7) Tester name and signature;

(8) Test results from § 63.565(c)(1) or (2), as appropriate;

(9) Documentation provided under § 63.563(a)(4)(ii) and (iii)(B) showing that the repair of leaking components attributed to a failure of a vapor-tightness test is technically infeasible without dry-docking the vessel; and

(10) Documentation that a marine tank vessel failing a pressure test or leak test has been repaired.
