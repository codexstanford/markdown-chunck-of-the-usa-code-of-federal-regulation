####### Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions

means the organic HAP emitted from a unit operation prior to introduction of the emission stream into a control device. Uncontrolled HAP emissions are determined after any condenser that is operating as a process condenser. If an emission stream is not routed to a control device, uncontrolled organic HAP emissions are those organic HAP emissions released to the atmosphere.
