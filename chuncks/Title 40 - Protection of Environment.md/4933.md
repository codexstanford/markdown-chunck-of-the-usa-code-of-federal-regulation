####### Air quality data and projections.

(d)(1) Each State must submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office with the plan, but not part of the plan, all lead air quality data measured since January 1, 1974. This requirement does not apply if the data has already been submitted.

(2) The data must be submitted in accordance with the procedures and data forms specified in Chapter 3.4.0 of the "AEROS User's Manual" concerning storage and retrieval of aerometric data (SAROAD) except where the Regional Administrator waives this requirement.

(3) If additional lead air quality data are desired to determine lead air concentrations in areas suspected of exceeding the lead national ambient air quality standard, the plan may include data from any previously collected filters from particulate matter high volume samplers. In determining the lead content of the filters for control strategy demonstration purposes, a State may use, in addition to the reference method, X-ray fluorescence or any other method approved by the Regional Administrator.
