####### Completeness.

(d)The Director shall not issue a permit before receiving a complete application for a permit except for emergency permits. An application for a permit is complete when the Director receives an application form and any supplemental information which are completed to his or her satisfaction. The completeness of any application for a permit shall be judged independently of the status of any other permit application or permit for the same facility or activity. For EPA-administered programs, an application which is reviewed under ยง 124.3 is complete when the Director receives either a complete application or the information listed in a notice of deficiency.
