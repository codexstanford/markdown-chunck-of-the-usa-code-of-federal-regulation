###### § 72.7 New units exemption.
####### Applicability.

(a)This section applies to any new utility unit that has not previously lost an exemption under paragraph (f)(4) of this section and that, in each year starting with the first year for which the unit is to be exempt under this section:

(1) Serves during the entire year (except for any period before the unit commenced commercial operation) one or more generators with total nameplate capacity of 25 MWe or less;

(2) Burns fuel that does not include any coal or coal-derived fuel (except coal-derived gaseous fuel with a total sulfur content no greater than natural gas); and

(3) Burns gaseous fuel with an annual average sulfur content of 0.05 percent or less by weight (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) and nongaseous fuel with an annual average sulfur content of 0.05 percent or less by weight (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section).

(b)(1) Any new utility unit that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and that is not allocated any allowances under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter shall be exempt from the Acid Rain Program, except for the provisions of this section, §§ 72.2 through 72.6, and §§ 72.10 through 72.13.

(2) The exemption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be effective on January 1 of the first full calendar year for which the unit meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. By December 31 of the first year for which the unit is to be exempt under this section, a statement signed by the designated representative (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit shall be submitted to permitting authority otherwise responsible for administering a Phase II Acid Rain permit for the unit. If the Administrator is not the permitting authority, a copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Administrator. The statement, which shall be in a format prescribed by the Administrator, shall identify the unit, state the nameplate capacity of each generator served by the unit and the fuels currently burned or expected to be burned by the unit and their sulfur content by weight, and state that the owners and operators of the unit will comply with paragraph (f) of this section.

(3) After receipt of the statement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the permitting authority shall amend under § 72.83 the operating permit covering the source at which the unit is located, if the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and requirements of the exemption under paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (d), and (f) of this section.

(c)(1) Any new utility unit that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and that is allocated one or more allowances under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter shall be exempt from the Acid Rain Program, except for the provisions of this section, §§ 72.2 through 72.6, and §§ 72.10 through 72.13, if each of the following requirements are met:

(i) The designated representative (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit submits to the permitting authority otherwise responsible for administering a Phase II Acid Rain permit for the unit a statement (in a format prescribed by the Administrator) that:

(A) Identifies the unit and states the nameplate capacity of each generator served by the unit and the fuels currently burned or expected to be burned by the unit and their sulfur content by weight;

(B) States that the owners and operators of the unit will comply with paragraph (f) of this section;

(C) Surrenders allowances equal in number to, and with the same or earlier compliance use date as, all of those allocated to the unit under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter for the first year that the unit is to be exempt under this section and for each subsequent year; and

(D) Surrenders any proceeds for allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) or this section withheld from the unit under § 73.10 of this chapter. If the Administrator is not the permitting authority, a copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Administrator.

(ii) The Administrator deducts from the compliance account of the source that includes the unit allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section and receives proceeds under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. Within 5 business days of receiving a statement in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator shall either deduct the allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section or notify the owners and operators that there are insufficient allowances to make such deductions.

(2) The exemption under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be effective on January 1 of the first full calendar year for which the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) of this section are met. After notification by the Administrator under the third sentence of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the permitting authority shall amend under § 72.83 the operating permit covering the source at which the unit is located, if the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and requirements of the exemption under paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (d), and (f) of this section.

(d) Compliance with the requirement that fuel burned during the year have an annual average sulfur content of 0.05 percent by weight or less shall be determined as follows using a method of determining sulfur content that provides information with reasonable precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness:

(1) For gaseous fuel burned during the year, if natural gas is the only gaseous fuel burned, the requirement is assumed to be met;

(2) For gaseous fuel burned during the year where other gas in addition to or besides natural gas is burned, the requirement is met if the annual average sulfur content is equal to or less than 0.05 percent by weight. The annual average sulfur content, as a percentage by weight, for the gaseous fuel burned shall be calculated as follows:

(3) For nongaseous fuel burned during the year, the requirement is met if the annual average sulfur content is equal to or less than 0.05 percent by weight. The annual average sulfur content, as a percentage by weight, shall be calculated using the equation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In lieu of the factor, volume times density (Vd), in the equation, the factor, mass (M), may be used, where Mis: mass of the nongaseous fuel in a delivery during the year to the unit of which the nth sample is taken, in lb; or, for fuel delivered during the year to the unit continuously by pipeline, mass of the nongaseous fuel delivered starting from when the nth sample of such fuel is taken until the next sample of such fuel is taken, in lb.

(e)(1) A utility unit that was issued a written exemption under this section and that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be exempt from the Acid Rain Program, except for the provisions of this section, §§ 72.2 through 72.6, and §§ 72.10 through 72.13 and shall be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (d), (e)(2), and (f) of this section in lieu of the requirements set forth in the written exemption. The permitting authority shall amend under § 72.83 the operating permit covering the source at which the unit is located, if the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and requirements of the exemption under this paragraph (e)(1) and paragraphs (a), (d), (e)(2), and (f) of this section.

(2) If a utility unit under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is allocated one or more allowances under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter, the designated representative (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit shall submit to the permitting authority that issued the written exemption a statement (in a format prescribed by the Administrator) meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) and (D) of this section. The statement shall be submitted by June 31, 1998 and, if the Administrator is not the permitting authority, a copy shall be submitted to the Administrator.
