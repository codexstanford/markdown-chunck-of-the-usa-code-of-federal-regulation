(3) The compliance date for all requirements of this part 258, unless otherwise specified, for an existing MSWLF unit or lateral expansion of an existing MSWLF unit receiving flood-related waste from federally-designated areas within the major disasters declared for the states of Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, and South Dakota by the President during the summer of 1993 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5121shall be designated by the state in which the MSWLF unit is located in accordance with the following:

(i) The MSWLF unit may continue to accept waste up to April 9, 1994 without being subject to part 258, if the state in which the MSWLF unit is located determines that the MSWLF unit is needed to receive flood-related waste from a federally-designated disaster area as specified in (e)(3) of this section.

(ii) The MSWLF unit that receives an extension under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section may continue to accept waste up to an additional six months beyond April 9, 1994 without being subject to part 258, if the state in which the MSWLF unit is located determines that the MSWLF unit is needed to receive flood-related waste from a federally-designated disaster area specified in (e)(3) of this section.

(iii) In no case shall a MSWLF unit receiving an extension under paragraph (e)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section accept waste beyond October 9, 1994 without being subject to part 258.

(4) For a MSWLF unit that meets the conditions for the exemption in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the compliance date for all applicable requirements of part 258, unless otherwise specified, is October 9, 1997.

(f)(1) Owners or operators of new MSWLF units, existing MSWLF units, and lateral expansions that dispose of less than twenty (20) tons of municipal solid waste daily, based on an annual average, are exempt from subparts D and E of this part, so long as there is no evidence of ground-water contamination from the MSWLF unit, and the MSWLF unit serves:

(i) A community that experiences an annual interruption of at least three consecutive months of surface transportation that prevents access to a regional waste management facility, or

(ii) A community that has no practicable waste management alternative and the landfill unit is located in an area that annually receives less than or equal to 25 inches of precipitation.

(2) Owners or operators of new MSWLF units, existing MSWLF units, and lateral expansions that meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this section must place in the operating record information demonstrating this.

(3) If the owner or operator of a new MSWLF unit, existing MSWLF unit, or lateral expansion has knowledge of ground-water contamination resulting from the unit that has asserted the exemption in paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator must notify the state Director of such contamination and, thereafter, comply with subparts D and E of this part.

(g) Municipal solid waste landfill units failing to satisfy these criteria are considered open dumps for purposes of State solid waste management planning under RCRA.

(h) Municipal solid waste landfill units failing to satisfy these criteria constitute open dumps, which are prohibited under section 4005 of RCRA.

(i) Municipal solid waste landfill units containing sewage sludge and failing to satisfy these Criteria violate sections 309 and 405(e) of the Clean Water Act.

(j) Subpart G of this part is effective April 9, 1995, except for MSWLF units meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in which case the effective date of subpart G is October 9, 1995.
