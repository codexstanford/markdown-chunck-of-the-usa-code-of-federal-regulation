1.

a. Configure the circuit shown in Figure 2, using the original equipment resistor.

b. At 20 +/-3 &#xB0;C (68 +/-5 &#xB0;F), apply voltage for 15 minutes; maintain current at 2.5 amps. At conclusion of 15 minutes, read voltage and current. Calculate resistance using the relationship

c. Replace OE test sample with part to be certified and repeat step b. above.

d. Resistance of the part shall be within +/-20% of original equipment resistance.
