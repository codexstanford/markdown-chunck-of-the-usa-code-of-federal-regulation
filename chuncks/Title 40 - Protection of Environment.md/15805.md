####### ยง 53.57 Test for filter temperature control during sampling and post-sampling periods.
######## Filter temperature control accuracy.

(3)(i) For each temperature measurement interval over each 4-hour test period, calculate the difference between the filter temperature indicated by the reference temperature sensor and the ambient temperature indicated by the test sampler as:

(ii) Tabulate and inspect the calculated differences as a function of time. To successfully pass the indicated filter temperature control test, the calculated difference between the measured values must not exceed 5 &#xB0;C for any consecutive intervals covering more than a 30-minute time period.

(iii) For sequential samplers, repeat the test calculations for each of the stored sequential sample filters. All stored filters must also meet the 5 &#xB0;C temperature control test.
