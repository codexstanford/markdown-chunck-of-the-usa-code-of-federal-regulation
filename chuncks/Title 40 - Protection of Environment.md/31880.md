() For the interval from the temperature 50 K below the boiling point to the final temperature, emissions shall be calculated as the summation of emissions for each 5 K increment, where the emission for each increment shall be calculated using Equation 11 of this subpart. If the final temperature of the heatup is lower than 5 K below the boiling point, the final temperature for the last increment shall be the final temperature of the heatup, even if the last increment is less than 5 K. If the final temperature of the heatup is higher than 5 K below the boiling point, the final temperature for the last increment shall be the temperature 5 K below the boiling point, even if the last increment is less than 5 K.
