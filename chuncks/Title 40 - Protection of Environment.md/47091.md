###### ยง 86.448-2006 What provisions apply to vehicles certified under the Recreational-vehicle program?
####### General provisions.

(a)If you are a highway-motorcycle manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce into commerce a new highway motorcycle with an engine below 50 cc if it is already certified to the requirements that apply to recreational vehicles under 40 CFR parts 1051. A highway motorcycle is a motorcycle that is a motor vehicle. If you comply with all of the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1051 for each recreational vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the motor vehicle under this part 86 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 86. See ยง 86.447-2006 for similar provisions that apply to nonroad engines produced for highway motorcycles.
