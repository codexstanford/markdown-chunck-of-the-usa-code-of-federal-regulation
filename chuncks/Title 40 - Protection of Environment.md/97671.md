####### Estimation of acute oral toxicity.

(i)When further study is warranted, EPA generally supports limiting such tests to those using the lowest number of animals feasible. EPA will accept three alternative Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test methods in place of the "traditional" acute oral toxicity test. The three OECD alternatives are the following:

(A) The up and down procedure as described in OECD Guideline 425 referenced in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

(B) The acute toxic class method as described in OECD Guideline 423 and referenced in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

(C) The fixed dose method as described in OECD Guideline 420 and referenced in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
