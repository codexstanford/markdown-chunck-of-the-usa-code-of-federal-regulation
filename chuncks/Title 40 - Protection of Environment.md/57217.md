####### Use of multiple financial mechanisms.

(g)An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per injection well. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds, guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e), respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the adjusted plugging and abandonment cost. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or letter of credit, he may use that trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may invoke any or all of the mechanisms to provide for plugging and abandonment of the injection well.
