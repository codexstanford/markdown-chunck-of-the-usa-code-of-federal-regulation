####### Revocation.

(b)The Administrator may revoke an experimental use permit if he finds that its terms or conditions are being violated or that its terms or conditions are inadequate to avoid unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, or if new evidence is obtained which demonstrates that the tolerance will be inadequate to protect the public health, or for failure to meet any other provision of this part 172. The Administrator will notify the permittee in writing of such revocation. The permittee shall notify all participants of such revocation as soon as possible after he receives notice of revocation. The revocation of a permit shall not preclude the Administrator from initiating civil or criminal sanctions for the violations of the permit conditions or otherwise as authorized by law.
