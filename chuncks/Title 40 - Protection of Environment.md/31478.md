####### Alternative monitoring parameters.

(f)The owner or operator who has been directed by any section of this subpart or any section of another subpart referenced by this subpart, that expressly referenced this paragraph (f) to set unique monitoring parameters, or who requests approval to monitor a different parameter than those specified in § 63.1314 for storage vessels, § 63.1315 or § 63.1317, as appropriate, for continuous process vents, § 63.1321 for batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams, or § 63.1330 for process wastewater shall submit the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section in the Precompliance Report, as required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record required by paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.

(1) The required information shall include a description of the parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the recovery device, control device, or pollution prevention measure is operated in conformance with its design and achieves the specified emission limit, percent reduction, or nominal efficiency, and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).

(2) The required information shall include a description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of Compliance Status report required in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, unless this information has already been included in the operating permit application.

(3) The required information shall include a description of the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system, to include the frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section is met:

(i) If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous; or

(ii) If reports of daily average values will not be included in Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status.
