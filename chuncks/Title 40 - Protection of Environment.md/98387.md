(8)At 12 months, 18 months, and at terminal sacrifice, a blood smear shall be obtained from all animals. A differential blood count should be performed on blood smears from those animals in the highest dosage group and the controls from the terminal sacrifice. If these data, or data from the pathological examination indicate a need, then the 12- and 18-month blood smears should also be examined. Differential blood counts should be performed for the next lower groups if there is a major discrepancy between the highest group and the controls. If clinical observations suggest a deterioration in health of the animals during the study, a differential blood count of the affected animals shall be performed.
