###### 2.1 Overview.

The national response system (NRS) is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS is composed of the National Response Team (NRT), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), On-scene coordinator (OSC), Area Committees, and Special Teams and related support entities. The NRS functions as an incident command system (ICS) under the direction of the OSC. Typical of an ICS, the NRS is capable of expanding or contracting to accommodate the response effort required by the size or complexity of the discharge.
