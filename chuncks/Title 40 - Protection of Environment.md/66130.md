###### § 261.1087 Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices.
####### i.e.,

(vi) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall operate the closed-vent system such that gases, vapors, or fumes are not actively vented to the control device during periods of planned maintenance or control device system malfunction (periods when the control device is not operating or not operating normally) except in cases when it is necessary to vent the gases, vapors, and/or fumes to avoid an unsafe condition or to implement malfunction corrective actions or planned maintenance actions.

(3) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material using a carbon adsorption system to comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall operate and maintain the control device in accordance with the following requirements:

(i) Following the initial startup of the control device, all activated carbon in the control device shall be replaced with fresh carbon on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements of § 261.1033(g) or (h) of this part.

(ii) All carbon that is hazardous waste and that is removed from the control device shall be managed in accordance with the requirements of § 261.1033(n), regardless of the average volatile organic concentration of the carbon.

(4) A remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material using a control device other than a thermal vapor incinerator, flare, boiler, process heater, condenser, or carbon adsorption system to comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall operate and maintain the control device in accordance with the requirements of § 261.1033(j) of this part.

(5) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall demonstrate that a control device achieves the performance requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section as follows:

(i) A remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall demonstrate using either a performance test as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section or a design analysis as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section the performance of each control device except for the following:

(A) A flare;

(B) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater;

(C) A boiler or process heater into which the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel;

(ii) A remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall demonstrate the performance of each flare in accordance with the requirements specified in § 261.1033(e).

(iii) For a performance test conducted to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall use the test methods and procedures specified in § 261.1034(c)(1) through (4).

(iv) For a design analysis conducted to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the design analysis shall meet the requirements specified in § 261.1035(b)(4)(iii).

(v) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall demonstrate that a carbon adsorption system achieves the performance requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section based on the total quantity of organics vented to the atmosphere from all carbon adsorption system equipment that is used for organic adsorption, organic desorption or carbon regeneration, organic recovery, and carbon disposal.

(6) If the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material and the Regional Administrator do not agree on a demonstration of control device performance using a design analysis then the disagreement shall be resolved using the results of a performance test performed by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. The Regional Administrator may choose to have an authorized representative observe the performance test.

(7) The closed-vent system and control device shall be inspected and monitored by the remanufacture or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material in accordance with the procedures specified in § 261.1033(f)(2) and (l). The readings from each monitoring device required by § 261.1033(f)(2) shall be inspected at least once each operating day to check control device operation. Any necessary corrective measures shall be immediately implemented to ensure the control device is operated in compliance with the requirements of this section.
