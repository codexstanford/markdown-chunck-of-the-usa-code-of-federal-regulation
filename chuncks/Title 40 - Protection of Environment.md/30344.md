######## Alternative metal emission control requirements for new liquid fuel boilers.

(3)(i) When you burn hazardous waste with a heating value less than 10,000 Btu/lb:

(A) You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain cadmium, lead, and selenium, combined, in excess of 78 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(B) You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain antimony, arsenic, beryllium, chromium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, combined, in excess of 12 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(ii) When you burn hazardous waste with a heating value greater than or equal to 10,000 Btu/lb:

(A) You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain in excess of 6.2 x 10lbs combined emissions of cadmium, lead, and selenium attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste; and

(B) You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain either in excess of 1.4 x 10lbs combined emissions of antimony, arsenic, beryllium, chromium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste;
