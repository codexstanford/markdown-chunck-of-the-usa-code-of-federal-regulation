####### Special procedures for blended biomass-based fuels.

(h)In the event that some portion of a petroleum product is biomass-based and was not derived by co-processing biomass and petroleum feedstocks together (i.e., the petroleum product was produced by blending a petroleum-based product with a biomass-based fuel), the reporting party shall calculate emissions for the petroleum product according to one of the methods in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(4) of this section, as appropriate.

(1) A reporter using Calculation Method 1 to determine the emission factor of a petroleum product shall calculate the COemissions associated with that product using Equation MM-8 of this section in place of Equation MM-1 of this section.

(2) A refinery using Calculation Method 1 of this subpart to determine the emission factor of a non-crude petroleum feedstock shall calculate the COemissions associated with that feedstock using Equation MM-9 of this section in place of Equation MM-2 of this section.
