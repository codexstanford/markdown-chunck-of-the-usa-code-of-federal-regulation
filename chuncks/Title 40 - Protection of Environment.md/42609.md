####### i.e.

(ii) For a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer (, a non-redundant backup analyzer that uses the same probe and sample interface as a primary monitoring system), no initial certification of the analyzer is required. A non-redundant backup analyzer, connected to the same probe and interface as a primary CEMS in order to satisfy the dual span requirements of section 2.1.1.4 or 2.1.2.4 of appendix A to this part, shall be treated in the same manner as a like-kind replacement analyzer.

(iii) Each non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer shall comply with the daily and quarterly quality assurance and quality control requirements in appendix B to this part for each day and quarter that the non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer is used to report data, and shall meet the additional linearity and calibration error test requirements specified in this paragraph. The owner or operator shall ensure that each non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer passes a linearity check (for pollutant concentration and diluent gas monitors) or a calibration error test (for flow monitors) prior to each use for recording and reporting emissions. For a primary NO-diluent CEMS consisting of the primary pollutant analyzer and a like-kind replacement diluent analyzer (or vice-versa), provided that the primary pollutant or diluent analyzer (as applicable) is operating and is not out-of-control with respect to any of its quality assurance requirements, only the like-kind replacement analyzer must pass a linearity check before the system is used for data reporting. When a non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer is brought into service, prior to conducting the linearity test, a probationary calibration error test (as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), which will begin a period of conditionally valid data, may be performed in order to allow the validation of data retrospectively, as follows. Conditionally valid data from the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer are validated back to the hour of completion of the probationary calibration error test if the following conditions are met: if no adjustments are made to the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer other than the allowable calibration adjustments specified in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part between the probationary calibration error test and the successful completion of the linearity test; and if the linearity test is passed within 168 unit (or stack) operating hours of the probationary calibration error test. However, if the linearity test is performed within 168 unit or stack operating hours but is either failed or aborted due to a problem with the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer, then all of the conditionally valid data are invalidated back to the hour of the probationary calibration error test, and data from the non-redundant backup CEMS or from the primary monitoring system of which the like-kind replacement analyzer is a part remain invalid until the hour of completion of a successful linearity test. Notwithstanding this requirement, the conditionally valid data status may be re-established after a failed or aborted linearity check, if corrective action is taken and a calibration error test is subsequently passed. However, in no case shall the use of conditional data validation extend for more than 168 unit or stack operating hours beyond the date and time of the original probationary calibration error test when the analyzer was brought into service.

(iv) When data are reported from a non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer, the appropriate bias adjustment factor shall be determined as follows:

(A) For a regular non-redundant backup CEMS, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, apply the bias adjustment factor from the most recent RATA of the non-redundant backup system (even if that RATA was done more than 12 months previously); or

(B) When a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer is used as a component of a primary CEMS (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section), apply the primary monitoring system bias adjustment factor.
