######### Calculation of allocation.

(b)For each control period for which a CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit's baseline heat input determined under § 96.384(c); or

(ii) The CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit's heat input, as determined in accordance with subpart HHHH of this part, for the immediately prior control period, except when the allocation is being calculated for the control period in which the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit enters the CAIR NOOzone Season Trading Program under § 96.384(g).

(2) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 96.384(d) and multiplied by 70 percent; or

(ii) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR NOOzone Season allowances are to be allocated.

(3) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section and if the CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit" (based on a demonstration of the intent to repower stated under § 96.383(a)(5)) providing for, allocation to a CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under this paragraph (subject to the conditions in §§ 96.384(h) and 96.386(g)), the permitting authority will allocate to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit as follows:

(1) For each control period in 2009 through 2014 for which the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(A) The CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 96.384(d); or

(B) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit at any time during the control period in which the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit enters the CAIR NOOzone Season Trading Program under § 96.384(g).

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(2) For each control period in 2015 and thereafter for which the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(A) 0.15 lb/mmBtu;

(B) The CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 96.384(d); or

(C) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR NOOzone Season allowances are to be allocated.

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to the CAIR NOOzone Season opt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
