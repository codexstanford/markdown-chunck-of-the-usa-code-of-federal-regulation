###### ยง 1033.525 Smoke opacity testing.

Analyze exhaust opacity test data as follows:

(a) Measure exhaust opacity using the procedures specified in 40 CFR 1065.1125. Perform the opacity test with a continuous digital recording of smokemeter response identified by notch setting over the entire locomotive test cycle specified in ยง 1033.515(c)(4) or ยง 1033.520(e)(4). Measure smokemeter response in percent opacity to within one percent resolution.

(b) Calibrate the smokemeter as follows:

(1) Calibrate using neutral density filters with approximately 10, 20, and 40 percent opacity. Confirm that the opacity values for each of these reference filters are NIST-traceable within 185 days of testing, or within 370 days of testing if you consistently protect the reference filters from light exposure between tests.

(2) Before each test, remove the smokemeter from the exhaust stream, if applicable, and calibrate as follows:
