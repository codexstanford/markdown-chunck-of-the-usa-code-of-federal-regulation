####### Pressure test for the marine tank vessel.

(1)(i) Each product tank shall be pressurized with dry air or inert gas to no more than the pressure of the lowest pressure relief valve setting.

(ii) Once the pressure is obtained, the dry air or inert gas source shall be shut off.

(iii) At the end of one-half hour, the pressure in the product tank and piping shall be measured. The change in pressure shall be calculated using the following formula:

(iv) The change in pressure, P, shall be compared to the pressure drop calculated using the following formula:

(v) If P&#x2264;PM, the vessel is vapor tight.

(vi) If P>PM, the vessel is not vapor tight and the source of the leak must be identified and repaired prior to retesting.
