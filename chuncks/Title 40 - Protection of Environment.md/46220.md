####### Stuck in range below the highest minimum enable temperature.

(C)To the extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD system must detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a temperature below the highest minimum enable temperature required by the OBD system to enable other monitors (e.g., an OBD system that requires ECT to be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit to enable a diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to inappropriately indicate a temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit). The manufacturer may forego this requirement for temperature regions in which the monitors required under paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii)(B) of this section will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in this paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C).
