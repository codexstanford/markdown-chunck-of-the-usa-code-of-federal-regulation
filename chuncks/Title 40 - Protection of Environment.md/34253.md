######## Intermittently-controlled work station

means a work station associated with a dryer with provisions for the dryer exhaust to be delivered to or diverted from a control device through a bypass line, depending on the position of a valve or damper. Sampling lines for analyzers, relief valves needed for safety purposes, and periodic cycling of exhaust dampers to ensure safe operation are not considered bypass lines.
