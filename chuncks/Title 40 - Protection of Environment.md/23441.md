####### Incinerator

means any enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds and that does not extract energy in the form of steam or process heat. These devices do not rely on the heating value of the waste gas to sustain efficient combustion. Auxiliary fuel is burned in the device and the heat from the fuel flame heats the waste gas to combustion temperature. Temperature is controlled by controlling combustion air or fuel.
