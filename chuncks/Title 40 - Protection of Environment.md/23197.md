####### Applicability.

(a)To determine which requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply to the owner or operator of a demolition or renovation activity and prior to the commencement of the demolition or renovation, thoroughly inspect the affected facility or part of the facility where the demolition or renovation operation will occur for the presence of asbestos, including Category I and Category II nonfriable ACM. The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to each owner or operator of a demolition or renovation activity, including the removal of RACM as follows:

(1) In a facility being demolished, all the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the combined amount of RACM is

(i) At least 80 linear meters (260 linear feet) on pipes or at least 15 square meters (160 square feet) on other facility components, or

(ii) At least 1 cubic meter (35 cubic feet) off facility components where the length or area could not be measured previously.

(2) In a facility being demolished, only the notification requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3)(i) and (iv), and (4)(i) through (vii) and (4)(ix) and (xvi) of this section apply, if the combined amount of RACM is

(i) Less than 80 linear meters (260 linear feet) on pipes and less than 15 square meters (160 square feet) on other facility components, and

(ii) Less than one cubic meter (35 cubic feet) off facility components where the length or area could not be measured previously or there is no asbestos.

(3) If the facility is being demolished under an order of a State or local government agency, issued because the facility is structurally unsound and in danger of imminent collapse, only the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(iii), (b)(4) (except (b)(4)(viii)), (b)(5), and (c)(4) through (c)(9) of this section apply.

(4) In a facility being renovated, including any individual nonscheduled renovation operation, all the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply if the combined amount of RACM to be stripped, removed, dislodged, cut, drilled, or similarly disturbed is

(i) At least 80 linear meters (260 linear feet) on pipes or at least 15 square meters (160 square feet) on other facility components, or

(ii) At least 1 cubic meter (35 cubic feet) off facility components where the length or area could not be measured previously.

(iii) To determine whether paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies to planned renovation operations involving individual nonscheduled operations, predict the combined additive amount of RACM to be removed or stripped during a calendar year of January 1 through December 31.

(iv) To determine whether paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies to emergency renovation operations, estimate the combined amount of RACM to be removed or stripped as a result of the sudden, unexpected event that necessitated the renovation.

(5) Owners or operators of demolition and renovation operations are exempt from the requirements of §§ 61.05(a), 61.07, and 61.09.
