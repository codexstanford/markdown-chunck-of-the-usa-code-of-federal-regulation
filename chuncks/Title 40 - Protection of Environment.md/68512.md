###### ยง 272.1651 New York State-administered program: Final authorization.
####### Vacated Federal rule.

(4)New York provisions at 371.1(e)(1)(xvi) and 371.4(i) are no longer considered to be part of New York's authorized program because the equivalent federal requirements were vacated by a federal court. The Federal Requirements ((Hazardous Waste Combustors; Revised Standards (HSWA) (40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 only) were published on June 19, 1998. The New York regulations were authorized on January 11, 2005 (effective March 14, 2005). The State's authorized program was subsequently codified in 40 CFR part 272 on March 26, 2007 (effective May 25, 2007). However, the corresponding Federal rules were later vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379; June 27, 2014). Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA issued a new final rule removing 40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 from the Federal CFR (published on April 8, 2015)
