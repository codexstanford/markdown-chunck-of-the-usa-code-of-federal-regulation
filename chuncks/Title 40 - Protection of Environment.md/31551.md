####### ยง 63.1349 Performance testing requirements.

(a) You must document performance test results in complete test reports that contain the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section, as well as all other relevant information. As described in ยง 63.7(c)(2)(i), you must make available to the Administrator prior to testing, if requested, the site-specific test plan to be followed during performance testing. For purposes of determining exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere from an alkali bypass stack or a coal mill stack, you must either install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate according to the requirements in paragraphs ยง 63.1350(n)(1) through (10) of this subpart or use the maximum design exhaust gas flow rate. For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS on the alkali bypass stack or coal mill stack, you may use the results of the initial and subsequent performance test to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit.
