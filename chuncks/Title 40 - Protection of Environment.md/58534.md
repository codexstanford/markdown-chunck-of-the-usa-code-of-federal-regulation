####### Products packaged in large sizes.

(2)(i) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a product is not required to be in child-resistant packaging if distributed and sold in the following sizes:

(A) If the product is a solid product, regardless of pesticide type, a size of 50 pounds or greater;

(B) If the product is a liquid product intended for use in swimming pools, a size greater than 7.5 gallons by volume;

(C) If the product is a liquid product intended for any other pesticide use, a size of 5 gallons or greater by volume;

(D) If the product is packaged as an aerosol (measured by weight), regardless of pesticide type, a weight of 2 pounds or greater.

(ii) The Agency may require that a product packaged in a size exceeding that listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section be distributed and sold only in child-resistant packaging if the Agency determines that the product is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold to homeowners or other members of the general public. If the Agency makes such a determination, it will notify the registrant in writing and provide a short statement of the basis of its determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to require the product to be distributed only in child-resistant packaging and will notify the registrant of its decision.
