####### quantitative analysis,

For accurate, reproduciblethe particle size of both sample and standard materials should be reduced to ∼10 µm (see Section 2.3.3). Dry ball milling at liquid nitrogen temperatures (e.g., Spex Freezer Mill, or equivalent) for a maximum time of 10 min. is recommended to obtain satisfactory particle size distributions while protecting the integrity of the crystal lattice.Bulk samples of very large particle size may require grinding in two stages for full matrix reduction to <10 µm.

Final particle size distributions should always be verified by optical microscopy or another suitable method.
