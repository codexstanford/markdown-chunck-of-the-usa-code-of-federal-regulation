######## Determination of CO,mass emissions using an O,monitor according to appendix F to this part.

(c)If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix F method, then the owner or operator shall determine hourly COconcentration and mass emissions with a flow monitoring system; a continuous Oconcentration monitor; fuel F and Ffactors; and, where Oconcentration is measured on a dry basis (or where Equation F-14b in appendix F to this part is used to determine COconcentration), either, a continuous moisture monitoring system, as specified in ยง 75.11(b)(2), or a fuel-specific default moisture percentage (if applicable), as defined in ยง 75.11(b)(1); and by using the methods and procedures specified in appendix F to this part. For units using a common stack, multiple stack, or bypass stack, the owner or operator may use the provisions of ยง 75.16, except that the phrase "COcontinuous emission monitoring system" shall apply rather than "SOcontinuous emission monitoring system," the term "maximum potential concentration of CO" shall apply rather than "maximum potential concentration of SO," and the phrase "COmass emissions" shall apply rather than "SOmass emissions."
