###### i.e.

17. Determine the dispersant performance (, percent of oil that is dispersed, or EFF) based on the ratio of oil dispersed in the test system to the total oil added to the system as follows:

18. Calculate EFF using equation 4 for coupled experiments with and without dispersant (EFFand EFF, respectively). EFFis the effectiveness of the control and represents natural dispersion of the oil in the test apparatus. EFFis the measured uncorrected value.

19. Calculate the final dispersant performance of a chemical dispersant agent after correcting for natural dispersion using equation 5.

20. Calculate the average dispersant effectiveness value by summing the corrected values (EFF) for each of the four replicates for each of the two test oils and dividing this sum by eight.
