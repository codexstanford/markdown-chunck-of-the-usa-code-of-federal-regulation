####### 10.2 Post-Sampling Calibration Check.

Conduct a stack gas post-sampling calibration check after the stack gas sampling run or set of runs and within 12 hours of the initial calibration. Conduct up-scale and zero calibration checks using the protocol in Section 10.1. Make no changes to the sampling system or EC cell calibration until all post-sampling calibration checks have been recorded. If either the zero or up-scale calibration error exceeds the respective specification in Sections 10.1.2 and 10.1.4 then all measurement data collected since the previous successful calibrations are invalid and re-calibration and re-sampling are required. If the sampling system is disassembled or the EC cell calibration is adjusted, repeat the calibration check before conducting the next analyzer sampling run.

The analytical procedure is fully discussed in Section 8.

Determine the CO and Oconcentrations for each stack gas sampling run by calculating the mean gas concentrations of the data recorded during the "measurement data phase".

Use the following protocols to verify consistent analyzer performance during each field sampling day.
