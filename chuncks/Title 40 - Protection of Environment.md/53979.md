(4)The no exposure certification must require the submission of the following information, at a minimum, to aid the NPDES permitting authority in determining if the facility qualifies for the no exposure exclusion:

(i) The legal name, address and phone number of the discharger (see ยง 122.21(b));

(iii) The certification must indicate that none of the following materials or activities are, or will be in the foreseeable future, exposed to precipitation:

(A) Using, storing or cleaning industrial machinery or equipment, and areas where residuals from using, storing or cleaning industrial machinery or equipment remain and are exposed to storm water;

(B) Materials or residuals on the ground or in storm water inlets from spills/leaks;

(C) Materials or products from past industrial activity;

(D) Material handling equipment (except adequately maintained vehicles);

(E) Materials or products during loading/unloading or transporting activities;

(F) Materials or products stored outdoors (except final products intended for outside use, e.g., new cars, where exposure to storm water does not result in the discharge of pollutants);

(G) Materials contained in open, deteriorated or leaking storage drums, barrels, tanks, and similar containers;

(H) Materials or products handled/stored on roads or railways owned or maintained by the discharger;

(I) Waste material (except waste in covered, non-leaking containers, e.g., dumpsters);

(J) Application or disposal of process wastewater (unless otherwise permitted); and

(K) Particulate matter or visible deposits of residuals from roof stacks/vents not otherwise regulated, i.e., under an air quality control permit, and evident in the storm water outflow;

(iv) All "no exposure" certifications must include the following certification statement, and be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of ยง 122.22: "I certify under penalty of law that I have read and understand the eligibility requirements for claiming a condition of "no exposure" and obtaining an exclusion from NPDES storm water permitting; and that there are no discharges of storm water contaminated by exposure to industrial activities or materials from the industrial facility identified in this document (except as allowed under paragraph (g)(2)) of this section. I understand that I am obligated to submit a no exposure certification form once every five years to the NPDES permitting authority and, if requested, to the operator of the local MS4 into which this facility discharges (where applicable). I understand that I must allow the NPDES permitting authority, or MS4 operator where the discharge is into the local MS4, to perform inspections to confirm the condition of no exposure and to make such inspection reports publicly available upon request. I understand that I must obtain coverage under an NPDES permit prior to any point source discharge of storm water from the facility. I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted. Based upon my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly involved in gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate and complete. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."
