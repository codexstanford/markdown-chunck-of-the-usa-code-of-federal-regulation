####### Illustrative example.

(i)The following example serves to illustrate the method. Males carrying genes for red eye color on chromosomes II and III are bred with females of white eye color carrying alleles for brown (bw) on the second chromosome and scarlet (st) and pink (pp) on the third chromosome. The Fmale progeny are bred with virgin females of the female parental stock and the resulting Fprogeny are examined for eye color phenotypes. If there is no translocation in the Fmale, then the resulting Fprogeny will have four eye color phenotypes: red, white, orange, and brown. If the Fmale carries a translocation between chromosomes II and III, only red and white eye phenotypes are obtained in the Fgeneration. This happens because the Ftranslocation heterozygote produces two balanced (carrying either the parental or the translocated configuration of markers) and two unbalanced gametes. The unbalanced gametes (carrying one normal and one translocated chromosome) are unable to develop into normal individuals in the Fgeneration.
