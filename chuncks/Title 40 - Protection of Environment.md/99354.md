####### Nonstandard notches or no notches.

(c)If your locomotive is equipped with more or less than 8 propulsion notches, recommend an alternate test cycle based on the in-use locomotive configuration. Unless you have data demonstrating that your locomotive will be operated differently from conventional locomotives, recommend weighting factors that are consistent with the power weightings of the specified duty cycle. For example, the average load factor for your recommended cycle (cycle-weighted power divided by rated power) should be equivalent to those of conventional locomotives. We may also allow the use of the standard power levels shown in Table 3 to this section for nonstandard locomotive testing subject to our prior approval. This paragraph (c) does not allow engines to be tested without consideration of the actual notches that will be used.
