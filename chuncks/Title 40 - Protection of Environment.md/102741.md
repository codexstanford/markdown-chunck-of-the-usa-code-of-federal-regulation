(iv) Perform a power regression using all the paired values of flow rate and corrected concentration to obtain a relationship in the form of=&#xB7;. Use concentration as the independent variable and flow rate as the dependent variable. For each data point, calculate the difference between the measured flow rate and the value represented by the curve fit. The difference at each point must be less than +/-1% of the appropriate regression value. The value ofmust be between -1.005 and -0.995. If your results do not meet these limits, take corrective action consistent with ยง 1065.341(a).
