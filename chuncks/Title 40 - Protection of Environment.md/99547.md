####### Switch locomotive

means a locomotive that is powered by an engine with a maximum rated power (or a combination of engines having a total rated power) of 2300 hp or less. Include auxiliary engines in your calculation of total power if the engines are permanently installed on the locomotive and can be operated while the main propulsion engine is operating. Do not count the power of auxiliary engines that operate only to reduce idling time of the propulsion engine.
