5.1.2.2 The test frequency for RCAs of the PM CEMS shall be triennial,once every 12 calendar quarters. If a required RCA is not completed within 12 calendar quarters after the calendar quarter in which the previous RCA was completed, it must be performed in a grace period immediately following the twelfth calendar quarter (see section 5.1.3, below). When an RCA is done in a grace period, the deadline for the next RCA shall be 12 calendar quarters after the calendar quarter in which the RCA was originally due, rather than the calendar quarter in which the grace period test is completed.
