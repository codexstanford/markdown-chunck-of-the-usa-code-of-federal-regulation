###### Shipping container:

7.2.1A shipping container that can maintain a temperature of 5&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;C is used for transporting the sample from the collection site to the analytical laboratory. Ice coolers or refrigerated shipping containers have been found to be satisfactory. The use of eutectic cold packs instead of ice will give a more stable temperature control. Such equipment is available from Cole-Parmer Company, 7425 North Oak Park Avenue, Chicago, IL 60648.
