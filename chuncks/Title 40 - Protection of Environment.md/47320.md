(c) EPA Enforcement Officers are authorized to obtain reasonable assistance without cost from those in charge of a facility to help them perform any function listed in this subpart and are authorized to request the manufacturer conducting the PCA to make arrangement with those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish reasonable assistance without cost to EPA, whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility.

(d) EPA Enforcement Officers are authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA Enforcement Officers may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant whether or not the Enforcement Officers first attempted to seek permission of the manufacturer conducting the PCA or the party in charge of the facilities in question to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section.

(e) A manufacturer that conducts a PCA shall permit EPA Enforcement Officers who present a warrant or court order as described in paragraph (d) of this section to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section and as described in the warrant or court order. The manufacturer shall cause those in charge of its facility or a facility operated for its benefit to permit EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section pursuant to a warrant or court order whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility. In the absence of such a warrant or court order, EPA Enforcement Officers may conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section only upon the consent of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question.

(f) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air Act for any person to refuse to permit EPA Enforcement Officers to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section without a warrant or court order.

(g) A manufacturer is responsible for locating its foreign testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions in which local foreign law does not prohibit EPA Enforcement Officers from conducting the entry and access activities specified in this section. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local foreign law prohibits.
