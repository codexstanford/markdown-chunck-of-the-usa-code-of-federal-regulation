######## Extreme performance fluoropolymer coating,e.g.,

means coatings that are formulated systems based on fluoropolymer resins which often contain bonding matrix polymers dissolved in non-aqueous solvents as well as other ingredients. Extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings are typically used when one or more critical performance criteria are required including, but not limited to a nonstick low-energy surface, dry film lubrication, high resistance to chemical attack, extremely wide operating temperature, high electrical insulating properties, or that the surface comply with government (USDA, FDA) or third party specifications for health, safety, reliability, or performance. Once applied to a substrate, extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings undergo a curing process that typically requires high temperatures, a chemical reaction, or other specialized technology.
