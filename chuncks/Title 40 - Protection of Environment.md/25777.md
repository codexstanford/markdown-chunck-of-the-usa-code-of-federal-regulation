####### Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data.

(4)Where bench-scale or pilot-scale test data are used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document that the data are representative of the actual annual average concentration, or are reliably indicative of another relevant characteristic of the wastewater stream that could be used to predict the annual average concentration. For concentration data, the owner or operator shall also provide documentation describing the testing protocol, and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination of annual average concentration.
