####### Excessive concentration

(kk)is defined for the purpose of determining good engineering practice stack height under § 51.100(ii)(3) and means:

(1) For sources seeking credit for stack height exceeding that established under § 51.100(ii)(2) a maximum ground-level concentration due to emissions from a stack due in whole or part to downwash, wakes, and eddy effects produced by nearby structures or nearby terrain features which individually is at least 40 percent in excess of the maximum concentration experienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy effects and which contributes to a total concentration due to emissions from all sources that is greater than an ambient air quality standard. For sources subject to the prevention of significant deterioration program (40 CFR 51.166 and 52.21), an excessive concentration alternatively means a maximum ground-level concentration due to emissions from a stack due in whole or part to downwash, wakes, or eddy effects produced by nearby structures or nearby terrain features which individually is at least 40 percent in excess of the maximum concentration experienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy effects and greater than a prevention of significant deterioration increment. The allowable emission rate to be used in making demonstrations under this part shall be prescribed by the new source performance standard that is applicable to the source category unless the owner or operator demonstrates that this emission rate is infeasible. Where such demonstrations are approved by the authority administering the State implementation plan, an alternative emission rate shall be established in consultation with the source owner or operator.

(2) For sources seeking credit after October 11, 1983, for increases in existing stack heights up to the heights established under § 51.100(ii)(2), either (i) a maximum ground-level concentration due in whole or part to downwash, wakes or eddy effects as provided in paragraph (kk)(1) of this section, except that the emission rate specified by any applicable State implementation plan (or, in the absence of such a limit, the actual emission rate) shall be used, or (ii) the actual presence of a local nuisance caused by the existing stack, as determined by the authority administering the State implementation plan; and

(3) For sources seeking credit after January 12, 1979 for a stack height determined under § 51.100(ii)(2) where the authority administering the State implementation plan requires the use of a field study or fluid model to verify GEP stack height, for sources seeking stack height credit after November 9, 1984 based on the aerodynamic influence of cooling towers, and for sources seeking stack height credit after December 31, 1970 based on the aerodynamic influence of structures not adequately represented by the equations in § 51.100(ii)(2), a maximum ground-level concentration due in whole or part to downwash, wakes or eddy effects that is at least 40 percent in excess of the maximum concentration experienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy effects.
