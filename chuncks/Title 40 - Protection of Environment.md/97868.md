####### Description of equipment and test methods.

(1)A description of the general design of the experiment and any equipment used shall be provided.

(i) Description of exposure apparatus, including design, type, dimensions, source of air, system for generating particles, aerosols, gasses, and vapors, method of conditioning air, treatment of exhaust air, and the method of housing animals in a test chamber.

(ii) Description of the equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, and particulate aerosol concentration and size.

(iii) Exposure data shall be tabulated and presented with mean values and measure of variability (e.g., standard deviation) and should include:

(A) Chemical purity of the test material.

(B) Airflow rates through the inhalation equipment.

(C) Temperature and humidity of air.

(D) Nominal concentration (total amount of test substance fed into the inhalation equipment divided by the volume of air).

(E) Actual concentration in test breathing zone.

(F) Particle size distribution (e.g., MMAD with GSD) and the bivariate distribution of fiber length and diameter, where appropriate.
