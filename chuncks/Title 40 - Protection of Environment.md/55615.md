###### Prohibition pursuant to CWA

(c)(1)section 312(f)(4)(B): A State may make written application to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under section 312(f)(4)(B) of the Act for the issuance of a regulation establishing a drinking water intake no discharge zone which completely prohibits discharge from a vessel of any sewage, whether treated or untreated, into that zone in particular waters, or portions thereof, within such State. Such application shall:

(i) Identify and describe exactly and in detail the location of the drinking water supply intake(s) and the community served by the intake(s), including average and maximum expected amounts of inflow;

(ii) Specify and describe exactly and in detail, the waters, or portions thereof, for which a complete prohibition is desired, and where appropriate, average, maximum and low flows in million gallons per day (MGD) or the metric equivalent;

(iii) Include a map, either a USGS topographic quadrant map or a NOAA nautical chart, as applicable, clearly marking by latitude and longitude the waters or portions thereof to be designated a drinking water intake zone; and

(iv) Include a statement of basis justifying the size of the requested drinking water intake zone, for example, identifying areas of intensive boating activities.

(2) If the Administrator finds that a complete prohibition is appropriate under this paragraph, he or she shall publish notice of such finding together with a notice of proposed rulemaking, and then shall proceed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553. If the Administrator's finding is that a complete prohibition covering a more restricted or more expanded area than that applied for by the State is appropriate, he or she shall also include a statement of the reasons why the finding differs in scope from that requested in the State's application.

(3) If the Administrator finds that a complete prohibition is inappropriate under this paragraph, he or she shall deny the application and state the reasons for such denial.

(4) For the following waters the discharge from a vessel of any sewage, whether treated or not, is completely prohibited pursuant to CWA section 312(f)(4)(B):

(i) Two portions of the Hudson River in New York State, the first is bounded by an east-west line through the most northern confluence of the Mohawk River which will be designated by the Troy-Waterford Bridge (126th Street Bridge) on the south and Lock 2 on the north, and the second of which is bounded on the north by the southern end of Houghtaling Island and on the south by a line between the Village of Roseton on the western shore and Low Point on the eastern shore in the vicinity of Chelsea, as described in Items 2 and 3 of 6 NYCRR Part 858.4.

(ii) [Reserved]
