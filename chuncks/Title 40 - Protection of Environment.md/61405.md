###### ยง 180.515 Carfentrazone-ethyl; tolerances for residues.
####### General.,H,H

(a)Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the following tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only the sum of carfentrazone-ethyl (ethyl-alpha-2-dichloro-5-[-4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-4-fluorobenzenepropanoate) and its metabolite carfentrazone-chloropropionic acid (alpha, 2-dichloro-5-[-4-difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-4-fluorobenzenepropanoic acid), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of carfentrazone-ethyl, in or on the following commodities:
