######## Organic HAP processing rate

means the rate at which the mass of organic HAP materials contained in refractory shapes are processed in an affected thermal process unit. The organic HAP processing rate is a function of the amount of organic HAP contained in the resins, binders, and additives used in a refractory mix; the amounts of those resins, binders, and additives in the refractory mix; and the rate at which the refractory shapes formed from the refractory mix are processed in an affected thermal process unit. For continuous process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit of time (e.g., pounds per hour). For batch process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit mass of refractory shapes processed during the batch process cycle (e.g., pounds per ton).
