(d) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Batch Option, you must determine the average VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust for each batch of each fermentation stage in a semiannual reporting period (January 1 through June 30 or July 1 through December 31). To determine which batches are in the semiannual reporting period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.

(e) To demonstrate compliance with an emission limitation using a 12-month calculation period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The first 12-month calculation period begins on the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in ยง 63.2133 and ends on the last day of the month that includes the date 1 year after your compliance date, unless the compliance date for your affected source is the first day of the month, in which case the first 12-month calculation period ends on the last day of the month that is 11 calendar months after the compliance date.

(2) The second 12-month calculation period and each subsequent 12-month calculation period begins on the first day of the month following the first full month of the previous 12-month calculation period and ends on the last day of the month 11 calendar months later.
