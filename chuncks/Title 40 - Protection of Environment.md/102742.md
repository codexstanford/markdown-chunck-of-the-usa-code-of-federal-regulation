####### ยง 1065.340 Diluted exhaust flow (CVS) calibration.
######## Reference flow meter.

(d)Calibrate a CVS flow meter using a reference flow meter such as a subsonic venturi flow meter, a long-radius ASME/NIST flow nozzle, a smooth approach orifice, a laminar flow element, a set of critical flow venturis, or an ultrasonic flow meter. Use a reference flow meter that reports quantities that are NIST-traceable within +/-1% uncertainty. Use this reference flow meter's response to flow as the reference value for CVS flow-meter calibration.
