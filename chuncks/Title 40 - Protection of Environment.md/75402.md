###### Wet Air Pollution Control

involves using water to remove chemicals, fumes, or dusts that are entrained in air streams exhausted from process tanks or production areas. Most frequently, wet air pollution control devices are used with electroplating, cleaning, and coating processes. A common type of wet air pollution control is the wet packed scrubber consisting of a spray chamber that is filled with packing material. Water is continuously sprayed onto the packing and the air stream is pulled through the packing by a fan. Pollutants in the air stream are absorbed by the water droplets and the air is released to the atmosphere. A single scrubber often serves numerous process tanks; however, the air streams typically are segregated by source into chromium, cyanide, and acid/alkaline sources. Wet air pollution control can be divided into several suboperations, including:

(1) Wet Air Pollution Control for Acid Alkaline Baths;

(2) Wet Air Pollution Control for Cyanide Baths;

(3) Wet Air Pollution Control for Chromium-Bearing Baths; and

(4) Wet Air Pollution Control for Fumes and Dusts.
