For the purpose of this method, a "reference" performance curve is defined as one that has been derived from primary standard calibration data, with the anemometer mounted vertically. "Primary standard" data are obtainable by: (a) direct calibration of one or more of the anemometers by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); (b) NIST-traceable calibration; or (c) Calibration by direct measurement of fundamental parameters such as length and time (by moving the anemometers through still air at measured rates of speed, and recording the output signals).
