###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Calculation Method 1.

(1)Calculate annual mass emissions from glycol dehydrators that have an annual average of daily natural gas throughput that is greater than or equal to 0.4 million standard cubic feet per day by using a software program, such as AspenTech HYSYS&#xAE; or GRI-GLYCalc, that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the equilibrium coefficient, speciates CHand COemissions from dehydrators, and has provisions to include regenerator control devices, a separator flash tank, stripping gas and a gas injection pump or gas assist pump. The following parameters must be determined by engineering estimate based on best available data and must be used at a minimum to characterize emissions from dehydrators:

(i) Feed natural gas flow rate.

(ii) Feed natural gas water content.

(iii) Outlet natural gas water content.
