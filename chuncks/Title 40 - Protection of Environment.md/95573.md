(ii)Theof a solution is a function of the concentration, c, expressed in mol/L, of all absorbing species present; the path length, d, of the spectrophotometer cell, expressed in cm; and the molar absorption (extinction) coefficient,ฮต, of each species. The absorbance (optical density) A of the solution is then given by:
