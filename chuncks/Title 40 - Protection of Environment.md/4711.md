####### Spectral Interferences and Spectral Overlap.

3.2Spectral interference occurs when the entirety of the analyte spectral lines of two species are nearly 100% overlapped. The presence of arsenic (As) is a problematic interference for EDXRF systems which use the Pb Lline exclusively to quantify the Pb concentration. This is because the Pb Lline and the As Klines severely overlap. The use of multiple Pb lines, including the Land/or the Llines for quantification must be used to reduce the uncertainty in the Pb determination in the presence of As. There can be instances when lines partially overlap the Pb spectral lines, but with the energy resolution of most detectors these overlaps are typically de-convoluted using standard spectral de-convolution software provided by the instrument vendor. An EDXRF protocol for Pb must define which Pb lines are used for quantification and where spectral overlaps occur. A de-convolution protocol must be used to separate all the lines which overlap with Pb.
