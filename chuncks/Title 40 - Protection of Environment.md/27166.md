####### Rim ditch (cell) building technique

means a gypsum dewatering stack construction technique that utilizes inner and outer dikes to direct gypsum slurry flow around the perimeter of the stack before directing the flow and allowing settling of finer materials into the settling compartment. For the purpose of this definition, the rim ditch (cell) building technique includes the compartment startup phase when gypsum is deposited directly into the settling compartment in preparation for ditch construction as well as the step-in or terminal phases when most solids must be directed to the settling compartment prior to stack closure. Decant return ditches are not rim ditches.
