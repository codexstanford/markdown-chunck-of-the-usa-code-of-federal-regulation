######## Species and strain.

(2)(i) The rat is the recommended test animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use of that species will be justified by the tester.

(ii) If a strain of mouse is used in this assay, the tester shall sample peripheral blood from an appropriate site on the test animal, e.g., the tail vein, as a source of normochromatic erythrocytes. Results shall be reported as outlined later in this guideline with "normochromatic" interchanged for "polychromatic", where specified.
