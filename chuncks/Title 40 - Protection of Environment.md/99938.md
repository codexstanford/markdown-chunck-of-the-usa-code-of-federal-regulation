####### Hybrid powertrain

means a powertrain that includes energy storage features other than a conventional battery system or conventional flywheel. Supplemental electrical batteries and hydraulic accumulators are examples of hybrid energy storage systems. Note other examples of systems that qualify as hybrid powertrains are systems that recover kinetic energy and use it to power an electric heater in the aftertreatment.
