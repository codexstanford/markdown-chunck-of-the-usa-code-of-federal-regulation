####### Density

is the mass of a unit volume of a material. It is a function of temperature, hence the temperature at which it is measured should be specified. For a solid, it is the density of the impermeable portion rather than the bulk density. For solids and liquids, suitable units of measurement are grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm). The density of a solution is the mass of a unit volume of the solution and suitable units of measurement are g/cm.
