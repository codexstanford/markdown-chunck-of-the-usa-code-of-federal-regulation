######## Lead reclamation facility

means a facility that casts remelted lead scrap generated by onsite lead acid battery manufacturing processes into lead ingots for use in the battery manufacturing process, and which is not a furnace affected under subpart X of this part. Lead scrap remelting processes that are used directly (not cast into an ingot first) in a grid casting facility or a three-process operations facility are parts of those facilities and are not part of a lead reclamation facility.
