####### ยง 1065.1145 Execution of accelerated aging, cycle tracking, and cycle validation criteria.

The aging cycle generally consists first of practice runs to validate and tune the final cycle, followed by the actual running of the repeat cycles needed to accumulate field equivalent hours to reach full useful life. During the course of the aging run, various aging parameters are tracked to allow verification of proper cycle execution, as well as to allow for correction of the aging parameters to stay within the target limits.
