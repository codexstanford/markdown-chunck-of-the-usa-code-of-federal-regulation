####### Fuel/additive groups.

(4)Fuel/additive groups are subdivisions of the fuel/additive categories. One or more group(s) are defined within each category in each fuel family according to the presence of differing characteristics in the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture.

The section which follows describes the fuel/additive groups.
