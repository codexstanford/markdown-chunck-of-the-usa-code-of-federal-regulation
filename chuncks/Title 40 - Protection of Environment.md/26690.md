(a)The owner or operator of an affected source with a Group 1 batch front-end process vent, as determined using the procedures in § 63.488, shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.

(1) For each batch front-end process vent, reduce organic HAP emissions using a flare.

(i) The owner or operator of the affected sources shall comply with the requirements of § 63.504(c) for the flare.

(ii) Halogenated batch front-end process vents, as defined in § 63.482, shall not be vented to a flare.

(2) For each batch front-end process vent, reduce organic HAP emissions for the batch cycle by 90 weight percent using a control device. Owners or operators may achieve compliance with this paragraph through the control of selected batch emission episodes or the control of portions of selected batch emission episodes. Documentation demonstrating how the 90 weight percent emission reduction is achieved is required by § 63.490(c)(2).
