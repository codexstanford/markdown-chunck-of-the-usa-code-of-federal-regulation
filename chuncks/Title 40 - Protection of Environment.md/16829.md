4.4.5(a) SOmeasurements are included within the NCore multipollutant site requirements as described in paragraph (3)(b) of this appendix. NCore-based SOmeasurements are primarily used to characterize SOtrends and assist in understanding SOtransport across representative areas in urban or rural locations and are also used for comparison with the SONAAQS. SOmonitors at NCore sites that exist in CBSAs with minimum monitoring requirements per section 4.4.2 above shall be allowed to count towards those minimum monitoring requirements.
