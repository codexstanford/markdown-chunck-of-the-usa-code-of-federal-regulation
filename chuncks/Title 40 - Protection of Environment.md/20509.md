######## e.g.,

(4) Perform checks at the frequency outlined in your site-specific monitoring plan to ensure pressure measurements are not obstructed (check for pressure tap plugging daily);

(5) Conduct a performance evaluation of the pressure monitoring system in accordance with your monitoring plan at the time of each performance test but no less frequently than annually; and

(6) If at any time the measured pressure exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range, conduct a performance evaluation of the pressure monitoring system in accordance with your monitoring plan and confirm that the pressure monitoring system continues to meet the performance requirements in your monitoring plan. Alternatively, install and verify the operation of a new pressure sensor.

(o) If you have an operating limit that requires a pH monitoring system, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (l) and (o)(1) through (4) of this section:

(1) Install the pH sensor in a position that provides a representative measurement of scrubber effluent pH;

(2) Ensure the sample is properly mixed and representative of the fluid to be measured;

(3) Conduct a performance evaluation of the pH monitoring system in accordance with your monitoring plan at least once each process operating day; and

(4) Conduct a performance evaluation (including a two-point calibration with one of the two buffer solutions having a pH within 1 of the pH of the operating limit) of the pH monitoring system in accordance with your monitoring plan at the time of each performance test but no less frequently than quarterly.

(p) If you have an operating limit that requires a secondary electric power monitoring system for an electrostatic precipitator, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (l) and (p)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Install sensors to measure (secondary) voltage and current to the precipitator collection plates; and

(2) Conduct a performance evaluation of the electric power monitoring system in accordance with your monitoring plan at the time of each performance test but no less frequently than annually.
