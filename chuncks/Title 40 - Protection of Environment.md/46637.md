####### Heavy-duty engines.

(3)This paragraph applies to engines, subsystems, or components used to establish exhaust emission deterioration factors for heavy-duty engines.

(i) The manufacturer must select the engines, subsystems, or components to be used to determine exhaust emission deterioration factors for each engine-family control system combination. Whether engines, subsystems, or components are used, they must be selected so that their emission deterioration characteristics may be expected to represent those of in-use engines, based on good engineering judgment.

(ii) [Reserved]

(d) [Reserved]

(e)(1) [Reserved]

(2) Any manufacturer may request to certify engine families with combined total sales of fewer than 10,000 light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines utilizing the procedures contained in ยง 86.094-14 for emission data vehicle selection and determination of deterioration factors. The deterioration factors are applied only to entire engine families.

(f) [Reserved]
