####### Timetable for issuance.

(iv)In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the permitting authority may not issue a final permit modification until after EPA's 45-day review period or until EPA has notified the permitting authority that EPA will not object to issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first, although the permitting authority can approve the permit modification prior to that time. Within 90 days of the permitting authority's receipt of an application under minor permit modification procedures (or 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under § 71.10(g) in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, whichever is later), the permitting authority shall:

(A) Issue the permit modification as proposed;

(B) Deny the permit modification application;

(C) Determine that the requested modification does not meet the minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the significant modification procedures; or

(D) Revise the draft permit modification (and, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, transmit to the Administrator the new proposed permit modification as required by § 71.10(d)).
