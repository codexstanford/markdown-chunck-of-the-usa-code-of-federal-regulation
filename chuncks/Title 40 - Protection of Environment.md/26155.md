####### Hard chromium electroplating

or industrial chromium electroplating means a process by which a thick layer of chromium (typically 1.3 to 760 microns) is electrodeposited on a base material to provide a surface with functional properties such as wear resistance, a low coefficient of friction, hardness, and corrosion resistance. In this process, the part serves as the cathode in the electrolytic cell and the solution serves as the electrolyte. Hard chromium electroplating process is performed at current densities typically ranging from 1,600 to 6,500 A/mfor total plating times ranging from 20 minutes to 36 hours depending upon the desired plate thickness.
