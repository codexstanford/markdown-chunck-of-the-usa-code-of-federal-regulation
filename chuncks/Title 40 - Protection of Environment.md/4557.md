####### Analytical Balance.

7.5The analytical balance must be suitable for weighing the type and size of filters required by the sampler. The range and sensitivity required will depend on the filter tare weights and mass loadings. Typically, an analytical balance with a sensitivity of 0.1 mg is required for high volume samplers (flow rates >0.5 m/min). Lower volume samplers (flow rates <0.5 m/min) will require a more sensitive balance.
