######## Aluminum recreational boat

means any marine or freshwater recreational boat that has a hull or deck constructed primarily of aluminum. A recreational boat is a vessel which by design and construction is intended by the manufacturer to be operated primarily for pleasure, or to be leased, rented or chartered to another for the latter's pleasure (rather than for commercial or military purposes); and whose major structural components are fabricated and assembled in an indoor, production-line manufacturing plant or similar land-side operation and not in a dry dock, graving dock, or marine railway on the navigable waters of the United States.
