####### Polymers which degrade, decompose, or depolymerize.

(3)A polymer cannot be manufactured under this section if the polymer is designed or is reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize, including those polymers that could substantially decompose after manufacture and use, even though they are not actually intended to do so. For the purposes of this section, degradation, decomposition, or depolymerization mean those types of chemical change that convert a polymeric substance into simpler, smaller substances, through processes including but not limited to oxidation, hydrolysis, attack by solvents, heat, light, or microbial action.
