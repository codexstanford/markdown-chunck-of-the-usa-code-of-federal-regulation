(c)Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section, and vehicles containing these engines, are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines and vehicles exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR part 90 or 1051. This applies to engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers who use these engines, and all other persons as if these engines were used in recreational vehicles or other nonroad applications. The prohibited acts of 42 U.S.C. 7522 apply to these new highway motorcycles; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 90 or 1051 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 86 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86, 90, or 1068.
