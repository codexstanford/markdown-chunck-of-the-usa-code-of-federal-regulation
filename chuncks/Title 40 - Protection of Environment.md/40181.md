3.3.2Examples are spectral interferants (e.g., water vapor and CO) or the overlap of spectral features of different compounds and contamination deposits on reflective surfaces or transmitting windows. To maximize the effectiveness of the mathematical techniques used in spectral analysis, identification of interferants (a standard initial step) and analysis of samples (includes effect of other analytical errors) are necessary. Thus, the Protocol requires post-analysis calculation of measurement concentration uncertainties for the detection of these potential sources of measurement error.

Before testing, demonstrate the suitability of FTIR spectrometry for the desired application according to the procedures of this section.
