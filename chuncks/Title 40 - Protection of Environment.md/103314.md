####### FID propane span gas.

(iv)Span and calibrate THC FID with span concentrations of propane, CH. Calibrate on a carbon number basis of one (C). For example, if you use a CHspan gas of concentration 200 µmol/mol, span a FID to respond with a value of 600 µmol/mol. Note that FID span balance gases may be any combination of purified air and purified nitrogen. We recommend FID analyzer span gases that contain approximately the flow-weighted mean concentration of Oexpected during testing. If the expected Oconcentration in the exhaust sample is zero, we recommend using a balance gas of purified nitrogen.
