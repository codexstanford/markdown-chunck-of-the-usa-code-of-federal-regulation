###### ยง 1045.305 How must I prepare and test my production-line engines?
####### Damage during shipment.

(f)If shipping an engine to a remote facility for production-line testing makes necessary an adjustment or repair, you must wait until after the initial emission test to do this work. We may waive this requirement if the test would be impossible or unsafe or if it would permanently damage the engine. Report to us in your written report under ยง 1045.345 all adjustments or repairs you make on test engines before each test.
