(TOC) means those compounds measured according to the procedures in § 60.664(b)(4). For the purposes of measuring molar composition as required in § 60.664(d)(2)(i); hourly emissions rate as required in § 60.664(d)(5) and § 60.664(e); and TOC concentration as required in § 60.665(b)(4) and § 60.665(g)(4), those compounds which the Administrator has determined do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ozone are to be excluded. The compounds to be excluded are identified in Environmental Protection Agency's statements on ozone abatement policy for State Implementation Plans (SIP) revisions (42 FR 35314; 44 FR 32042; 45 FR 32424; 45 FR 48942).
