3.4.2.1Because oils contain toxic, volatile materials, and because the toxicity of some water-soluble fractions of oil and degradation products are changed by oxidation, special care must be used in the oxygenation of test solutions. Aeration during the test is generally not recommended but should be used to maintain the required dissolved oxygen (DO) in cases where low DO is observed. The DO content of test solutions must not drop below 60% saturation during the first 48 hours of a static acute (96-hour) test and must remain between 40-100% after the first 48 hours of the test. Aeration at a rate of 100+/-15 bubbles per minute is supplied by a serological pipette as needed for maintenance of DO. If aeration is necessary, all test chambers should be aerated. At this rate, and with the proper weight of fish, DO concentration should remain slightly above 4 ppm over a 96-hour period. Take DO measurements daily.
