###### Sampling considerations.

2.5The use of a particle filter on the sample inlet line of a chemiluminescence OFRM analyzer is required to prevent buildup of particulate matter in the measurement cell and inlet components. This filter must be changed weekly (or at least often as specified in the manufacturer's operation/instruction manual), and the sample inlet system used with the analyzer must be kept clean, to avoid loss of Oin the Osample air prior to the concentration measurement.
