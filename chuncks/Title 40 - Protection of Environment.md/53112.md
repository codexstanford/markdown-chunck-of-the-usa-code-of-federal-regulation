(B)For each waste stream disposed of in the landfill, calculate the waste disposal quantities for historic years in which direct waste disposal measurements are not available using historical production data and Equation TT-3 of this section.

(C) For any year in which historic production or processing data are not available such that historic waste quantities cannot be estimated using Equation TT-3 of this section, calculate an average annual bulk waste disposal quantity using either Equation TT-4a of this section when data are available consecutively for the most recent disposal years or Equation TT-4b of this section when data are available for sporadic (non-consecutive) years.
