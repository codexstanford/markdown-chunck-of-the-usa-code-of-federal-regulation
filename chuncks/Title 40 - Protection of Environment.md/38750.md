######## Emissions limits and work practice standards.

(a)(1) You must not discharge to the atmosphere through any combination of stacks or other vents captured process exhaust gases from the copper concentrate dryers, smelting vessels, converting vessels, matte drying and grinding plants, secondary gas systems, and anode refining department that contain particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM) in excess of 89.5 pounds per hour (lb/hr) on a 24-hour average basis.

(2) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released during the transfer of molten materials from smelting vessels and converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a control device.

(3) You must operate one or more capture systems that collect the gases and fumes released from each vessel used to refine blister copper, remelt anode copper, or remelt anode scrap and convey each collected gas stream to a control device. One control device may be used for multiple collected gas streams.
