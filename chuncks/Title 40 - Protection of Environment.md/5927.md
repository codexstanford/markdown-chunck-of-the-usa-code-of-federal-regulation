####### Dynamometer.

(a)Once per week, the calibration of each dynamometer and each fly wheel shall be checked by a dynamometer coast-down procedure comparable to that in ยง 86.118-78 of this chapter between the speeds of 55 to 45 mph, and between 30 to 20 mph. All rotating dynamometer components shall be included in the coast-down check for the inertia weight selected. For dynamometers with uncoupled rolls, the uncoupled rollers may undergo a separate coast-down check. If a vehicle is used to motor the dynamometer to the beginning coast-down speed, the vehicle shall be lifted off the dynamometer rolls before the coast-down test begins. If the difference between the measured coast-down time and the theoretical coast-down time is greater than + 1 second, the system shall lock out, until corrective action brings the dynamometer into calibration.
