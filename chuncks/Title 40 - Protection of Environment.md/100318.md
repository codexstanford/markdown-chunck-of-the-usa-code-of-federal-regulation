(1) Calculatefor each measurement at each operating condition as follows:

(2) For transmissions that are configured to not allow slip, you may calculatebased on the gear ratio using the following equation:

(3) Calculateas the mean power loss from all measurements at a given operating condition.

(4) The following example illustrates a calculation of:

(g) Create a table with the mean power loss,, corresponding to each operating condition for input into GEM. Also include power loss in neutral for each tested engine's speed, if applicable. Express transmission input speed in r/min to one decimal place; express input torque in N&#xB7;m to two decimal places; express power loss in kW to four decimal places. Record the following values:
