(l)The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) submitted a 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of Pointe Coupee Parish on February 28, 2007. The area is designated unclassifiable/attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. EPA determined this request for Pointe Coupee Parish was complete on May 2, 2007. The maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, and is consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of Pointe Coupee Parish on May 9, 2013.
