####### Detection Limit (DL).

2.2A typical estimate of the one-sigma detection limit (DL) is about 2 ng Pb/cmor 0.001 Âµg Pb/m, assuming a filter size of 46.2 mm (filter deposit area of 11.86 cm) and a sample air volume of 24 m. The DL is an estimate of the lowest amount of Pb that can be reliably distinguished from a blank filter. The one-sigma detection limit for Pb is calculated as the average overall uncertainty or propagated error for Pb, determined from measurements on a series of blank filters from the filter lot(s) in use. Detection limits must be determined for each filter lot in use. If a new filter lot is used, then a new DL must be determined. The sources of random error which are considered are calibration uncertainty; system stability; peak and background counting statistics; uncertainty in attenuation corrections; and uncertainty in peak overlap corrections, but the dominating source by far is peak and background counting statistics. At a minimum, laboratories are to determine annual estimates of the DL using the guidance provided in Reference 5.
