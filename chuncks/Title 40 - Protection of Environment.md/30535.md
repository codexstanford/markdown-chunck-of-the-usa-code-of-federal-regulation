####### Process vent

means a vent from a unit operation or vents from multiple unit operations within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in § 63.1257(d)(2)(ii); test data using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6; Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63; or any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not considered process vents. Process vents do not include vents on storage tanks regulated under § 63.1253, vents on wastewater emission sources regulated under § 63.1256, or pieces of equipment regulated under § 63.1255.
