######## Recommended procedure to quantify lever-arm length.

(b)Quantify the lever-arm length, NIST-traceable within +/-0.5% uncertainty. The lever arm's length must be measured from the centerline of the dynamometer to the point at which the reference force is measured. The lever arm must be perpendicular to gravity (i.e., horizontal), and it must be perpendicular to the dynamometer's rotational axis. Balance the lever arm's torque or quantify its net hanging torque, NIST-traceable within +/-1% uncertainty, and account for it as part of the reference torque.
