() The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.

(ii) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire batch emission episode to determine the average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 18 and 19.

(iii) If grab samples are taken to determine the average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions shall be calculated according to paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) and (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.

(A) For each measurement point, the emission rates shall be calculated using Equations 20 and 21.

(B) The emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 22 and 23.

(iv) The control efficiency for the control device shall be calculated using Equation 24.

(v) If the batch front-end process vent entering a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel, the weight-percent reduction of total organic HAP or TOC across the device shall be determined by comparing the TOC or total organic HAP in all combusted batch front-end process vents and primary and secondary fuels with the TOC or total organic HAP, respectively, exiting the combustion device.

(2) The percent reduction for the batch cycle shall be determined using Equation 25 and the control device efficiencies specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section. All information used to calculate the batch cycle percent reduction, including a definition of the batch cycle identifying all batch emission episodes, shall be recorded as specified in ยง 63.491(b)(2). This information shall include identification of those batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected for control.

(i) If a performance test is required by paragraph (c) of this section, the control efficiency of the control device shall be as determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.

(ii) If a performance test is not required by paragraph (c) of this section for a combustion control device, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the control efficiency of the control device shall be 98 percent. The control efficiency for a flare shall be 98 percent.

(iii) If a performance test is not required by paragraph (c) of this section for a noncombustion control device, the control efficiency shall be determined by the owner or operator based on engineering assessment.
