(a) For any pair of sample and total flow rates, use continuous recorded data or 1 Hz means. Total flow rate means the raw exhaust flow rate for raw exhaust sampling and the dilute exhaust flow rate for CVS sampling. For each test interval, determine the standard error of the estimate,of the sample flow rate versus the total flow rate as described in ยง 1065.602, forcing the intercept to zero. Determine the mean sample flow rate over each test interval as described in ยง 1065.602. For each test interval, demonstrate thatis at or below 3.5% of the mean sample flow rate.

(b) For any pair of sample and total flow rates, use continuous recorded data or 1 Hz means. Total flow rate means the raw exhaust flow rate for raw exhaust sampling and the dilute exhaust flow rate for CVS sampling. For each test interval, demonstrate that each flow rate is constant within +/-2.5% of its respective mean or target flow rate. You may use the following options instead of recording the respective flow rate of each type of meter:
