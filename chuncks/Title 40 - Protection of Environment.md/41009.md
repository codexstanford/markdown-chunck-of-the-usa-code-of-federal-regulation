###### ยง 65.157 Performance test and flare compliance determination requirements.
####### Prior test results and waivers.

(b)Initial performance tests and initial flare compliance determinations are required only as specified in this subpart.

(1) Unless requested by the Administrator, an owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test or flare compliance determination under this subpart if a prior performance test or compliance determination was conducted using the same methods specified in ยง 65.158, and either no process changes have been made since the test or the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.

(2) Individual performance tests and flare compliance determinations may be waived upon written application to the Administrator per ยง 65.164(b)(3) if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance under 40 CFR part 63, or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR part 61, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance under 40 CFR part 63, or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR part 61, and the Administrator is still considering that request.

(3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notification is given to the owner or operator of the source.
