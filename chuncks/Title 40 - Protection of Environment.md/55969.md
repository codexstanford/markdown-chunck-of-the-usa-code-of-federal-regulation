####### OCCT

(3) Any water system is deemed to have optimized or re-optimized corrosion control if it submits results of tap water monitoring in accordance with ยง 141.86 demonstrating that the 90th percentile tap water lead level is less than or equal to the lead practical quantitation level of 0.005 mg/L and does not exceed the copper action level for two consecutive 6-month tap sampling monitoring periods, and does not have optimal water quality parameters that were set by the State under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. Any such system with 90th percentile tap sample results that thereafter exceeds the lead practical quantitation level or copper action level during any tap sampling period shall not be eligible to be deemed to have optimizedin accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) without first completing the treatment steps specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section

(i) [Reserved]

(ii) Any water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) shall continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap no less frequently than once every three calendar years using the reduced number of sites specified in ยง 141.86(c) and collecting samples at times and locations specified in ยง 141.86(d)(4)(v).
