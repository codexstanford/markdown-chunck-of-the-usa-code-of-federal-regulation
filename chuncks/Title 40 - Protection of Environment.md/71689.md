#### PART 403 - GENERAL PRETREATMENT REGULATIONS FOR EXISTING AND NEW SOURCES OF POLLUTION
##### § 403.12 Reporting requirements for POTW's and industrial users.
###### Periodic reports on continued compliance.,see

(e)(1) Any Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard (except a Non-Significant Categorical User as defined in § 403.3(v)(2)), after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New Source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Control Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Control Authority or the Approval Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the Discharge reported in paragraph (b)(4) of this section except that the Control Authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the User shall submit documentation required by the Control Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. At the discretion of the Control Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Control Authority may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. For Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority, as of December 21, 2025 or an EPA-approved alternative date (40 CFR 127.24(e) or (f)), all reports submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the industrial user to the Control Authority or initial recipient, as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b), in compliance with this section and 40 CFR part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to part 3), 40 CFR 122.22, and 40 CFR part 127. 40 CFR part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of 40 CFR part 127, the Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular control mechanism or if required to do so by state law.

(2) The Control Authority may authorize the Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:

(i) The Control Authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.

(ii) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the Permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism.

(iii) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.

The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section and include the certification statement in § 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.

(iv) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Control Authority must be included as a condition in the User's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Control Authority for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.

(v) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's control mechanism by the Control Authority, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User:

(vi) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Control Authority; and notify the Control Authority.

(vii) This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.

(3) The Control Authority may reduce the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Approval Authority, where the Industrial User meets all of the following conditions:

(i) The Industrial User's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:

(A) 0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the Industrial User discharges in batches;

(B) 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and

(C) 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for which approved local limits were developed by a POTW in accordance with § 403.5(c) and paragraph (d) of this section;

(ii) The Industrial User has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in § 403.8(f)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two years;

(iii) The Industrial User does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section;

(iv) The Industrial User must notify the Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. Upon notification, the Industrial User must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

(v) The Control Authority must retain documentation to support the Control Authority's determination that a specific Industrial User qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section for a period of 3 years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism.

(4) For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in § 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall include the User's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
