###### ยง 75.32 Determination of monitor data availability for standard missing data procedures.
####### i.e.,
######## Non-load-based,concentration data.

(d)NOemission rate and NOUse the procedures in this paragraph to provide substitute NOdata for affected units that do not produce electrical output (in megawatts) or thermal output (in klb/hr of steam). For each hour of missing NOemission rate data, or NOconcentration data used to determine NOmass emissions:

(1) If the monitor data availability is equal to or greater than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:

(i) For a missing data period less than or equal to 24 hours, substitute, as applicable, for each missing hour, the arithmetic average of the NOemission rates or NOconcentrations recorded by a monitoring system in a 2,160 hour lookback period. The lookback period may be comprised of either:

(A) The previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours, or

(B) The previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins, as defined in section 3 of appendix C to this part, are used.

(ii) For a missing data period greater than 24 hours, substitute, for each missing hour, the 90th percentile NOemission rate or the 90th percentile NOconcentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used).

(2) If the monitor data availability is at least 90.0 percent but less than 95.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system for that hour of the missing data period according to the following procedures:

(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to eight hours, substitute, as applicable, the arithmetic average of the hourly NOemission rates or NOconcentrations recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used).

(ii) For a missing data period greater than eight hours, substitute, for each missing hour, the 95th percentile hourly flow rate or the 95th percentile NOemission rate or the 95th percentile NOconcentration recorded by a monitoring system during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used).

(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum hourly NOemission rate or the maximum hourly NOconcentration recorded during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours (or during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding operational bin, if operational bins are used).

(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum NOemission rate, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential NOconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. In addition, when operational bins are used, the owner or operator shall substitute (as applicable) the maximum potential NOemission rate or the maximum potential NOconcentration for any hour in the missing data period in which essential operating or parametric data are unavailable and the operational bin cannot be determined.

(5) If operational bins are used and no prior quality-assured NOconcentration data or NOemission rate data exist for the corresponding operational bin, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, either the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential NOconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part.

(6) Table 3 of this section summarizes the provisions of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section.
