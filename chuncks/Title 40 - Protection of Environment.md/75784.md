###### Real-time feed monitoring

(m)means a system designed to track the rate of feed consumption and to detect uneaten feed passing through the nets at a net pen facility. These systems may rely on a combination of visual observation and hardware, including, but not limited to, devices such as video cameras, digital scanning sonar, or upweller systems that allow facilities to determine when to cease feeding the aquatic animals. Visual observation alone from above the pens does not constitute real-time monitoring.
