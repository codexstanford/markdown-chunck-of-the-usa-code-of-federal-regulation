####### Closed vent system leak repair provisions.

(d)The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply to closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a storage vessel, transfer rack, or equipment leak.

(1) If there are visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks at the time of the annual visual inspections required by paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the owner or operator shall follow either of the following procedures:

(i) The owner or operator shall eliminate the indications of the leak.

(ii) The owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) Leaks as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million by volume above background shall be repaired as soon as practical except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Records shall be generated as specified in ยง 65.163(a)(3) when a leak is detected.

(i) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, repairs shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected or at the beginning of the next introduction of vapors to the system, whichever is later.

(3) Delay of repair of a closed vent system for which leaks have been detected is allowed if repair within 15 days after a leak is detected is technically infeasible without a closed vent system shutdown, as defined in ยง 65.2, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment shall be completed as soon as practical, but not later than the end of the next closed vent system shutdown.
