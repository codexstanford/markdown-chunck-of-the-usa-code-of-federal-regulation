####### ยง 63.11945 What performance testing requirements must I meet for process vents?
######## Emission profile by process.

(i)The emission profile must consider all batch emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and must consider production scheduling. The profile must describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device in any given hour. Emissions per episode must be calculated using the procedures specified in ยง 63.11950. Emissions per episode must be divided by the duration of the episode only if the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.
