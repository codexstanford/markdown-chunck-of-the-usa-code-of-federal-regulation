###### Sampling and storage of test materials.

3.3Toxicity tests are performed with No. 2 fuel oil having the characteristics defined in table 5. Store oil used for toxicity tests in sealed containers to prevent the loss of volatiles and other changes. For ease in handling and use, it is recommended that 1,000-ml glass containers be used. To ensure comparable results in the bioassay tests, use oils packaged and sealed at the source. Dispose of unused oil in each open container on completion of dosing to prevent its use at a later date when it may have lost some of its volatile components. Run all tests in a bioassay series with oil from the same container and with organisms from the same group collected or secured from the same source.
