###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### § 63.5170 How do I demonstrate compliance with the standards?
######## Control device destruction or removal efficiency, DRE.

(i)For each control device used to comply with § 63.5120(a), continuously monitor the gas stream entering and exiting the control device to determine the total volatile organic matter mass flow rate (e.g., by determining the concentration of the vent gas in grams per cubic meter and the volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per second, such that the total volatile organic matter mass flow rate in grams per second can be calculated using Equation 1 of § 63.5160, and the percent destruction or removal efficiency, DRE, of the control device can be calculated for each month using Equation 2 of § 63.5160.

(ii) Determine the percent capture efficiency, CE, for each work station in accordance with § 63.5160(e).
