####### n,T

(3) The measurement at each unique combination of speed and torque setpoints constitutes a test interval. Unless we specify otherwise, you may program the dynamometer to control either speed or torque for a given test interval, with operator demand controlling the other parameter. Control speed and torque so that all recorded speed points are within +/-1% offrom the target speed and all recorded engine torque points are within +/-5% offrom the target torque during each test interval, except as follows:

(i) For steady-state engine operating points that cannot be achieved, and the operator demand stabilizes at minimum; program the dynamometer to control torque and let the engine govern speed (see 40 CFR 1065.512(b)(1)). Control torque so that all recorded engine torque points are within +/-25 N&#xB7;m from the target torque. The specified speed tolerance does not apply for the test interval.
