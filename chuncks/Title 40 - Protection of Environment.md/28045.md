####### i.e.,

(B) Flowrate shall be measured using Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, Appendix 1, for determining flow measurement traverse point location; and Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, Appendix 1, shall be used to measure duct velocity. If low flow conditions are encountered (velocity pressure differentials less than 0.05 inches of water) during the performance test, a more sensitive manometer or other pressure measurement device shall be used to obtain an accurate flow profile.

(ii) Molecular weight shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (h)(4)(iii)(B) and (h)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) An integrated bag sample shall be collected during the Method 4, 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A, moisture test. Analyze the bag sample using a gas chromatograph-thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) analysis meeting the following criteria:
