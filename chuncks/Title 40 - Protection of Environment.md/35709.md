###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### § 63.5170 How do I demonstrate compliance with the standards?
######## As-purchased compliant coatings.

(a)If you elect to use coatings that individually meet the organic HAP emission limit in § 63.5120(a)(2) as-purchased, to which you will not add HAP during distribution or application, you must demonstrate that each coating material applied during the 12-month compliance period contains no more than 0.046 kg HAP per liter of solids on an as-purchased basis.

(1) Determine the organic HAP content for each coating material in accordance with § 63.5160(b) and the volume solids content in accordance with § 63.5160(c).

(2) Combine these results using Equation 1 of this section and compare the result to the organic HAP emission limit in § 63.5120(a)(2) to demonstrate that each coating material contains no more organic HAP than the limit.
