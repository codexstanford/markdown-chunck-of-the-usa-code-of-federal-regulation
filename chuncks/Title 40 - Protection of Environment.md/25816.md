####### Compare mass removal efficiency to required efficiency.

(6)Compare the mass removal efficiency (calculated in Equation WW3) to the required efficiency as specified in ยง 63.138(e) of this subpart. If complying with ยง 63.138(e)(1), compliance is demonstrated if the mass removal efficiency is 99 percent or greater. If complying with ยง 63.138(e)(2), compliance is demonstrated if the mass removal efficiency is greater than or equal to the flow-weighted average of the Fr values calculated in Equation WW8.
