## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart UUUUU - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
###### Appendix E to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63 - Data Elements
####### Note:

The applicable data elements in sections 17 through 31 of this appendix must be submitted separately, in XML format, along with the quarterly Compliance Report (for stack tests) or along with the electronic test results submitted to the ECMPS Client Tool (for CMS performance evaluations). The Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) or an equivalent schema can be utilized to create this XML file.Ideally, for all of the tests completed at a given facility in a particular calendar quarter, the applicable data elements in sections 17 through 31 of this appendix should be submitted together in one XML file. However, as shown in Table 8 to this subpart, the timelines for submitting stack test results and CMS performance evaluations are not identical. Therefore, for calendar quarters in which both types of tests are completed, it may not be possible to submit the applicable data elements for all of those tests in a single XML file; separate submittals may be necessary to meet the applicable reporting deadlines.
