####### Scope.

(a)To facilitate temporarily disabling emission controls during a qualified emergency situation, manufacturers may apply for approval of auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) under this section. Once activated, an AECD approved under this section may disable any emission controls as necessary to address a qualified emergency situation, subject to the limitations in this section. For the purposes of this section, automatically limiting engine performance to induce an operator to perform emission-related maintenance-such as refilling a DEF tank-is considered an emission control. AECDs approved under this section are not defeat devices, and their proper use during a qualified emergency situation is not prohibited under Clean Air Act section 203 (42 U.S.C. 7522). Manufacturers may apply for AECD approval at any time; however, we encourage manufacturers to obtain preliminary approval before submitting an application for certification. We may allow manufacturers to apply an approved AECD to engines and equipment that have already been placed into service.
