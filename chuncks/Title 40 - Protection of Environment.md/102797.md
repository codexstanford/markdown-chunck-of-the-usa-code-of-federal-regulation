(5) If a sample dryer is not used in this verification test, use good engineering judgment to prevent condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point whereis measured to the analyzer. We recommend that you design your system so the wall temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the point whereis measured to the analyzer are at least 5 &#xB0;C above the local sample gas dewpoint.

(6) Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization time may include time to purge the transfer line and to account for analyzer response.

(7) While the analyzer measures the sample's concentration, record 30 seconds of sampled data. Calculate the arithmetic mean of this data. The analyzer meets the interference verification if this value is within (0.0 +/-0.4) mmol/mol.
