##### Subpart S - General Compliance Provisions for Control of Air Pollution From New and In-Use Light-Duty Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Vehicles
###### § 86.1825-01 Durability demonstration procedures for refueling emissions.

This section applies to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles which are certified under light-duty rules as allowed under the provisions of § 86.1801-01(c) which are subject to refueling loss emission compliance. Refer to the provisions of §§ 86.1811-01, 86.1811-04, 86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, and 86.1816-04 to determine applicability of the refueling standards to different classes of vehicles for various model years. Diesel fuel vehicles may qualify for an exemption to the requirements of this section under the provisions of § 86.1810. The manufacturer shall determine a durability process that will predict the expected refueling emission deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles over their full useful life. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in determining this process.
