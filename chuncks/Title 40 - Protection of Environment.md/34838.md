(3) Determine the mass fraction of volatile organic matter for each coating used in the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg volatile organic matter per kg coating. You may determine the volatile organic matter mass fraction using Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60, ASTM D2369-10 (R2015), "Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings" (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), or an EPA approved alternative method. Alternatively, you may use information provided by the manufacturer or supplier of the coating. In the event of any inconsistency between information provided by the manufacturer or supplier and the results of Method 24, ASTM D2369-10 (R2015), or an approved alternative method, the test method results will govern.

(4) Determine the density of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used in the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, kg per liter, according to ยง 63.4151(c).

(5) Measure the volume of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used in the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, liters.

(6) Calculate the solvent recovery system's volatile organic matter collection and recovery efficiency, using Equation 2 of this section:

(7) Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions reduction for the coating operation controlled by the solvent recovery system during the compliance period, using Equation 3 of this section:
