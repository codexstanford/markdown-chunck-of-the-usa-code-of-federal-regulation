####### Opacity records.

(f)The owner or operator shall record opacity data as specified by the State or local air pollution control agency. If the State or local air pollution control agency does not specify recordkeeping requirements for opacity, then record the information required by paragraphs (f) (1) through (5) of this section for each affected unit, except as provided in §§ 75.14(b), (c), and (d). The owner or operator shall also keep records of all incidents of opacity monitor downtime during unit operation, including reason(s) for the monitor outage(s) and any corrective action(s) taken for opacity, as measured and reported by the continuous opacity monitoring system:

(1) Component/system identification code;

(2) Date, hour, and minute;

(3) Average opacity of emissions for each six minute averaging period (in percent opacity);

(4) If the average opacity of emissions exceeds the applicable standard, then a code indicating such an exceedance has occurred; and

(5) Percent monitor data availability (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent), calculated according to the requirements of the procedure recommended for State Implementation Plans in appendix M to part 51 of this chapter.
