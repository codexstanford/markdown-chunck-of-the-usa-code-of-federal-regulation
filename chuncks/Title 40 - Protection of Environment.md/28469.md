####### Regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO)

means a thermal oxidizer that transfers heat from the exhaust gas stream to the inlet gas stream by passing the exhaust stream through a bed of ceramic stoneware or other heat-absorbing medium before releasing it to the atmosphere, then reversing the gas flow so the inlet gas stream passes through the heated bed, raising the temperature of the inlet stream close to or at its ignition temperature.
