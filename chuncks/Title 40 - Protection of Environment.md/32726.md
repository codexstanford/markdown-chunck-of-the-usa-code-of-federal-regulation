###### Emission Standards and Operating Requirements
####### ยง 63.1506 Operating requirements.
######## Capture/collection systems.

(c)For each affected source or emission unit equipped with an add-on air pollution control device, the owner or operator must:

(1) Design and install a system for the capture and collection of emissions to meet the engineering standards for minimum exhaust rates or facial inlet velocities as contained in the ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14);

(2) Vent captured emissions through a closed system, except that dilution air may be added to emission streams for the purpose of controlling temperature at the inlet to a fabric filter; and

(3) Operate each capture/collection system according to the procedures and requirements in the OM&M plan.

(4) In lieu of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of a sweat furnace may design, install and operate each sweat furnace in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) As demonstrated by an annual negative air flow test conducted in accordance with ยง 63.1510(d)(3), air flow must be into the sweat furnace or towards the plane of the sweat furnace opening.

(ii) The owner or operator must maintain and operate the sweat furnace in a manner consistent with the good practices requirements for minimizing emissions, including unmeasured emissions, in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions may include, but are not limited to the following:

(A) Increasing the exhaust rate from the furnace with draft fans, so as to capture emissions that might otherwise escape from the sweat furnace opening;

(B) Minimizing the time the sweat furnace doors are open;

(C) Keeping building doors and other openings closed to the greatest extent possible to minimize drafts that would divert emissions from being drawn into the sweat furnace;

(D) Maintaining burners on low-fire or pilot operation while the doors are open;

(E) Conducting periodic inspections and maintenance of sweat furnace components to ensure their proper operation and performance including but not limited to, door assemblies, seals, combustion chamber refractory material, afterburner and stack refractory, blowers, fans, dampers, burner tubes, door raise cables, pilot light assemblies, baffles, sweat furnace and afterburner shells and other internal structures.

(iii) The owner or operator must document in their operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&M) plan the procedures to be used to minimize emissions, including unmeasured emissions, in addition to the procedures to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the sweat furnace.
