######## Actual emissions

means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions unit as determined in paragraphs (1)-(3) of this definition:

(1) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. EPA shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.

(2) EPA may presume that the source-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit.

(3) For any emissions unit which has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.
