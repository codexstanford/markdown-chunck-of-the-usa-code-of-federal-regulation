####### § 63.1348 Compliance requirements.
######## HCl Compliance.

(6)If you are subject to limitations on HCl emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the HCl standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(6).

(i) For an affected source that is equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or dry scrubber, you may demonstrate initial compliance by conducting a performance test as specified in § 63.1349(b)(6)(i). You must determine the HCl concentration for each run and calculate the arithmetic average of the concentrations measured for the three runs to determine compliance. You must also establish appropriate site-specific operational parameter limits.

(ii) For an affected source that is not equipped with a wet scrubber, tray tower or dry scrubber, you must demonstrate initial compliance by operating a CEMS as specified in § 63.1349(b)(6)(ii). You must use the average of the hourly HCl values obtained during the first 30 kiln operating days that occur after the compliance date of this rule to determine initial compliance.
