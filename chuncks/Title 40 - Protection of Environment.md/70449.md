###### Level of contamination.

4.1.2.3.2.1Evaluate the population factor based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Determine which factor applies for an intake as specified in section 4.1.2.3. Evaluate intakes subject to Level I concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.2, intakes subject to Level II concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.3, and intakes subject to potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.4.

For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
