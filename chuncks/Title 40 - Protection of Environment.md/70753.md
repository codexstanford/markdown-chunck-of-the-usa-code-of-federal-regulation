###### General media treatment:

4.5.1.1Buy Bushnell-Haas (B-H) broth in quantities to last no longer than one year. Use media on a first-in, first-out basis. When practical, buy media in quarter-pound multiples, rather than one-pound multiples to keep supply sealed as long as possible. Keep an inventory of media, including kind, amount, lot number, expiration date, date received, and date opened. Check inventory before reordering media. Discard media that are caked, discolored, or show other deterioration.
