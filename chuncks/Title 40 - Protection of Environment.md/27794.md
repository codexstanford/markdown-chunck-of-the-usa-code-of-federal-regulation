###### § 63.745 Standards: Primer, topcoat, and specialty coating application operations.
####### Inorganic HAP emissions

(g). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, each owner or operator of a new or existing primer, topcoat, or specialty coating application operation subject to this subpart in which any of the coatings that are spray-applied (as defined in § 63.742) and contain inorganic HAP, shall comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Apply these coatings in a booth, hangar, or portable enclosure in which air flow is directed downward onto or across the part or assembly being coated and exhausted through one or more outlets.

(2) Control the air stream from this operation as follows:

(i) For existing sources, the owner or operator must choose one of the following:

(A) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through a dry particulate filter system certified using the methods described in § 63.750(o) to meet or exceed the efficiency data points in Tables 2 and 3 of this section; or

(B) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through a waterwash system that shall remain in operation during all coating application operations; or

(C) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through an air pollution control system that meets or exceeds the efficiency data points in Tables 2 and 3 of this section and is approved by the permitting authority.

(ii) For new sources, either:

(A) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through a dry particulate filter system certified using the methods described in § 63.750(o) to meet or exceed the efficiency data points in Tables 4 and 5 of this section; or

(B) Before exhausting it to the atmosphere, pass the air stream through an air pollution control system that meets or exceeds the efficiency data points in Tables 4 and 5 of this section and is approved by the permitting authority.

(iii) Owners or operators of new sources that have commenced construction or reconstruction after June 6, 1994 but prior to October 29, 1996 may comply with the following requirements in lieu of the requirements in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section:

(A) Pass the air stream through either a two-stage dry particulate filter system or a waterwash system before exhausting it to the atmosphere.

(B) If the primer, topcoat, or specialty coating contains chromium or cadmium, control shall consist of a HEPA filter system, three-stage filter system, or other control system equivalent to the three-stage filter system as approved by the permitting agency.

(iv) If a dry particulate filter system is used, the following requirements shall be met:

(A) Maintain the system in good working order;

(B) Install a differential pressure gauge across the filter banks;

(C) Continuously monitor the pressure drop across the filter and read and record the pressure drop once per shift, or install an interlock system that will automatically shut down the coating spray application system if the pressure drop exceeds or falls below the filter manufacturer's recommended limit(s); and

(D) Take corrective action when the pressure drop exceeds or falls below the filter manufacturer's recommended limit(s).

(v) If a conventional waterwash system is used, continuously monitor the water flow rate and read and record the water flow rate once per shift, or install an interlock system that will automatically shut down the coating spray application system if the water flow rate falls below or exceeds the limit(s) specified by the booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures. If a pumpless system is used, continuously monitor the booth parameter(s) that indicate performance of the booth per the manufacturer's recommendations to maintain the booth within the acceptable operating efficiency range and read and record the parameters once per shift, or install an interlock system that will automatically shut down the coating spray application system if the booth parameters are outside the parameter range in the manufacturer's recommendations.

(3) If the pressure drop across the dry particulate filter system, as recorded pursuant to § 63.752(d)(1), is outside the limit(s) specified by the filter manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures, shut down the operation immediately and take corrective action. If the water path in the waterwash system fails the visual continuity/flow characteristics check, or the water flow rate recorded pursuant to § 63.752(d)(2) exceeds the limit(s) specified by the booth manufacturer or in locally prepared operating procedures, or the booth manufacturer's or locally prepared maintenance procedures for the filter or waterwash system have not been performed as scheduled, shut down the operation immediately and take corrective action. The operation shall not be resumed until the pressure drop or water flow rate is returned within the specified limit(s).

(4) The requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this section do not apply to the following:

(i) Touch-up of scratched surfaces or damaged paint;

(ii) Hole daubing for fasteners;

(iii) Touch-up of trimmed edges;

(iv) Coating prior to joining dissimilar metal components;

(v) Stencil operations performed by brush or air brush;

(vi) Section joining;

(vii) Touch-up of bushings and other similar parts;

(viii) Sealant detackifying;

(ix) Spray application of primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings in an area identified in a title V permit, where the permitting authority has determined that it is not technically feasible to spray apply coatings to the parts in a booth;

(x) The use of hand-held non-refillable aerosol containers; and
