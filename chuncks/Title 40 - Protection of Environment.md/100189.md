(6) Determineto at least three decimal places. For example, if your coastdown testing results in a drag area of 6.430, but your wind tunnel method results in a drag area of 6.200,would be 1.037 (or a higher value you declare).

(7) If a tractor and trailer cannot be configured to meet the gap requirements specified in ยง 1037.501(g)(1)(ii), test with the trailer positioned as close as possible to the specified gap dimension and use good engineering judgment to correct the results to be equivalent to a test configuration meeting the specified gap dimension. For example, we may allow you to correct your test output using an approved alternate method or substitute a test vehicle that is capable of meeting the required specifications and is otherwise aerodynamically equivalent. This allowance applies for certification, confirmatory testing, SEA, and all other testing to demonstrate compliance with standards.

(8) You may ask us for preliminary approval of your coastdown testing under ยง 1037.210. We may witness the testing.
