(3) An owner or operator may request that compliance with the hydrogen chloride emissions limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. The relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for the affected facility shall be established during the initial compliance test.

(4) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial compliance test for hydrogen chloride as required under ยง 60.8.

(5) Following the date of the initial compliance test or the date on which the initial compliance test is required under ยง 60.8, the owner or operator of an affected facility located within a large MWC plant shall conduct a performance test for hydrogen chloride on an annual basis (no more than 12 calendar months following the previous compliance test).
