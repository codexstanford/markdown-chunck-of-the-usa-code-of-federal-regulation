####### Solvent of high photochemical reactivity

(2)means any solvent with an aggregate of more than 20 percent of its total volume composed of the chemical compounds classified below or which exceeds any of the following individual percentage composition limitations in reference to the total volume of solvent:

(i) A combination of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ethers, or ketones having an olefinic or cycloolefinic type of unsaturation: 5 percent;

(ii) A combination of aromatic compounds with eight or more carbon atoms to the molecule except ethylbenzene: 8 percent;

(iii) A combination of ethylbenzene, ketones having branched hydrocarbon structures, trichloroethylene or toluene: 20 percent. Whenever any organic solvent or any constituent of an organic solvent may be classified from its chemical structure into more than one of the above groups of organic compounds, it shall be considered as a member of the most reactive chemical group, that is, that group having the least allowable percentage of total volume of solvents.
