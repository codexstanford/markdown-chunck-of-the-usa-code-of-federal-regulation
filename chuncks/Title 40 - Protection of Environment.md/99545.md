####### Sulfur-sensitive technology,i.e.,

means an emission control technology that would experience a significant drop in emission control performance or emission-system durability when a locomotive is operated on low-sulfur diesel fuel with a sulfur concentration of 300 to 500 ppm as compared to when it is operated on ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel (fuel with a sulfur concentration less than 15 ppm). Exhaust gas recirculation is not a sulfur-sensitive technology.
