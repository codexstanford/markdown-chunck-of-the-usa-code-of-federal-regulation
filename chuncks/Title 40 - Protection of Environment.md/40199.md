###### Quantitatively Evaluate Fractional Model Uncertainty (FMU).

6.2Perform the procedures of either section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this addendum:

6.2.1 Using appendix I of this addendum, determine the fractional model error (FMU) for each analyte.

6.2.2 Provide statistically determined uncertainties FMU for each analyte which are equivalent to two standard deviations at the 95 percent confidence level. Such determinations, if employed, must be based on mathematical examinations of the pertinent sample spectra (not the reference spectra alone). Include in the report of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) a complete description of the determination of the concentration uncertainties.
