The spikes must be prepared from EPA Traceability Protocol gases. Your procedure must be designed to spike field samples at two target levels both before and after the test. Your target spike levels should bracket the average sample NOconcentrations. The higher target concentration must be less than the calibration span. You must collect at least 5 data points for each target concentration. The spiking procedure must be performed before the first run and repeated after the last run of the test program.
