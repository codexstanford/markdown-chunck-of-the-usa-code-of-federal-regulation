####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Oxidizer.

(3)To demonstrate compliance through performance tests of capture efficiency and control device efficiency, continuous monitoring of capture system, and CPMS for control device operating parameters for each oxidizer used to control emissions from one or more web coating lines, you must:

(i) Monitor the operating parameter in accordance with ยง 63.3350(e) to ensure control device efficiency; and

(ii) For each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer, monitor the operating parameter established in accordance with ยง 63.3350(f) to ensure capture efficiency; and

(iii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those web coating lines served by each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer either:

(A) In accordance with paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have only always-controlled work stations; or

(B) In accordance with paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii), (v), and (p) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controlled work stations.
