####### Dose levels and dose selection.

(iii)(A) Three dose levels must be used, spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects and mortality rates. The data collected must be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve and permit an acceptable estimation of the LD. Range finding studies using single animals may help to estimate the positioning of dose groups so that no more than three dose levels will be necessary.
