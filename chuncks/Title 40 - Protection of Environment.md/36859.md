######## Pile burner

means a boiler design incorporating a design where the anticipated biomass fuel has a high relative moisture content. Grates serve to support the fuel, and underfire air flowing up through the grates provides oxygen for combustion, cools the grates, promotes turbulence in the fuel bed, and fires the fuel. The most common form of pile burning is the dutch oven.
