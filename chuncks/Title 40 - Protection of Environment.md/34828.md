###### Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls Option
####### § 63.4151 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## Calculate the total volume of coating solids used during the compliance period.

(f)Determine the total volume of coating solids used, liters, which is the combined volume of coating solids for all of the coatings used during the compliance period, using Equation 2 of this section.

(g) Calculate the organic HAP emission rate, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids used, using Equation 3 of this section:

(h) The organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.4110, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option and, if there were no deviations from the emission limitations, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090.
