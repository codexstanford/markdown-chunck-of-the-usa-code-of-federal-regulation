####### Detection instrument performance criteria.

(2)(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid, and not for each individual HAP, VOC or other regulated material individual chemical compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not regulated materials, the representative stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.

(ii) If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
