######## Engine idle start-stop

(iii)means a technology which enables a vehicle to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle comes to a rest and restarts the engine when the driver applies pressure to the accelerator or releases the brake. Off-cycle engine start-stop credits will only be allowed for a vehicle if the Administrator has made a determination under the testing and calculation provisions in 40 CFR Part 600 that engine start-stop is the predominant operating mode for that vehicle.
