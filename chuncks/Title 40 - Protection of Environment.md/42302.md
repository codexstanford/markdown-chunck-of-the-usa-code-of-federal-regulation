###### ยง 73.82 Application for allowances from reserve program.
####### Application Requirements.

(a)Each application for Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve allowances, shall:

(1) Certify that the applicant is a utility;

(2) Demonstrate that the applicant, any subsidiary of the applicant, or any subsidiary of the applicant's holding company, is an owner or operator, in whole or in part, of at least one Phase I or Phase II unit by including in the application the name and Allowance Tracking System account number of a Phase I or Phase II unit which it owns or operates and for which it is listed as an owner or operator on the certificate of representation submitted by the designated representative for the unit pursuant to ยง 72.20 of this chapter;

(3) Through certification, demonstrate that the applicant is paying in whole or in part for one or more qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy generation (that became operational during the period of applicability) either directly or through payment to another person that purchases the qualified energy conservation measure or qualified renewable energy generation;

(4) Demonstrate that the applicant is subject to a least cost plan or a least cost planning process that:

(i) provides an opportunity for public notice and comment or other public participation processes;

(ii) evaluates the full range of existing and incremental resources in order to meet expected future demand at lowest system cost;

(iii) treats demand-side resources and supply-side resources on a consistent and integrated basis;

(iv) takes into account necessary features for system operation such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk;

(v) may take into account other factors, including the social and environmental costs and benefits of resource investments; and

(vi) is being implemented by the applicant to the maximum extent practicable.

(5) Demonstrate that the qualified energy conservation measure adopted or qualified renewable energy generated, or both, are consistent with the least cost plan or least cost planning process;

(6) If the applicant is subject to the rate-making jurisdiction of a State or local utility regulatory authority, its least cost plan or least cost planning process has been approved or accepted by the utility regulatory authority in the State or locality in which the qualified conservation measure(s) are adopted or in which the qualified renewable energy generation is utilized, and such State or local utility regulatory authority certifies that the least-cost plan or least-cost planning process meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section;

(7) If the applicant is not subject to the rate-making jurisdiction of a State or local regulatory authority, its least cost plan or least cost planning process has been approved or has been accepted by the utility regulatory authority with rate-making jurisdiction over the applicant, and such utility regulatory authority certifies that the least cost plan or least cost planning process meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section;

(8) If the applicant is an independent power production facility that sells qualified renewable energy generation to another utility, the applicant has enclosed documentation that such qualified renewable energy generation was purchased pursuant to the purchasing utility's least cost plan or least cost planning process, which has been approved or accepted by the purchasing utility's utility regulatory authority.

(9)(i) If the applicant is an investor-owner utility subject to the ratemaking jurisdiction of a State utility regulatory authority and is submitting an application on the basis of one or more qualified energy conservation measures, such State utility regulatory authority has established a procedure for determining rates and charges ensuring net income neutrality, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, including a provision that the utility's net income is compensated in full (considering factors such as risk) for lost sales attributable to the utility's conservation programs, which may include:

(A) General ratemaking for formulas that decouple utility profits from actual utility sales;

(B) Specific rate adjustment formulas that allow a utility to recover in its retail rates the full costs of conservation measures plus any associated net revenues lost as a result of reduced sales resulting from conservation initiatives; or

(C) Conservation incentive mechanisms designed to provide positive financial rewards to a utility to encourage implementation of cost-effective measures;

(ii) Provided that the existence of any one of the categories of ratemaking or rate adjustment formulas or conservation incentive mechanisms specified in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section shall not necessarily constitute fulfillment of the net income neutrality requirement unless, pursuant to ยง 73.83, the Secretary of Energy has certified the establishment of such net income neutrality;

(10) Demonstrate that the applicant has implemented the qualified energy conservation measures or used the qualified renewable energy generation specified in the application during the period of applicability;

(11) Demonstrate the extent to which installation of the qualified conservation measure(s) has achieved actual energy savings, by stating, on the basis of the performance of the measure(s) following installation:

(i) The amount of kilowatt hour savings resulting from the measure(s) in the given year(s);

(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the methodology used to calculate the kilowatt hour savings; and

(iii) The name, address, and phone number of the person who performed the calculation of kilowatt hour savings;

(12) Report the type and amount of yearly qualified renewable energy generation, by stating (and submitting documentation, including copies of plant operation records, supporting such statements) the kilowatt hours of qualified renewable energy generated during a previous calendar year or years; and

(13) Report the extent to which qualified renewable energy generation was produced in combination with other energy sources (hereafter "hybrid generation") by stating (and submitting documentation, including copies of plant operation records, supporting such statements) the heat input and heat rate of the non-qualified renewable generation, the total annual kilowatt hours generated, and the kilowatt hours that can be attributed to qualified renewable energy generation;

(14) Demonstrate the extent to which the implementation of qualified energy conservation measures or the use of qualified renewable energy generation has resulted in avoided tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the utility during the period of applicability, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
