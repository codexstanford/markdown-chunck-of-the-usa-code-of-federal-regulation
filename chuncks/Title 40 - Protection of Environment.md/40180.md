###### Sample-Independent Factors.

3.3.1Examples are system configuration and performance (e.g., detector sensitivity and infrared source output), quality and applicability of reference absorption spectra, and type of mathematical analyses of the spectra. These factors define the fundamental limitations of FTIR measurements for a given system configuration. These limitations may be estimated from evaluations of the system before samples are available. For example, the detection limit for the absorbing compound under a given set of conditions may be estimated from the system noise level and the strength of a particular absorption band. Similarly, the accuracy of measurements may be estimated from the analysis of the reference spectra.
