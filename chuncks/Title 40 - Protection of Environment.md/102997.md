(ii) Run a second operating point targeting a positive torque. Follow the same procedure in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) through (F) of this section, except that the dynamometer is set to target a torque equal to the mean feedback torque over the recording period from the previous operating point plus 20% of.

(iii) Use the mean feedback speed and torque values from paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section to determine the warm high-idle speed. If the two recorded speed values are the same, use that value as the warm high-idle-speed. Otherwise, use a linear equation passing through these two speed-torque points and extrapolate to solve for the speed at zero torque and use this speed intercept value as the warm high-idle speed.
