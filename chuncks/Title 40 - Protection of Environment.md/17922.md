###### § 60.58b Compliance and performance testing.

(a) The provisions for startup, shutdown, and malfunction are provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

(1) Except as provided by § 60.56b, the standards under this subpart apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Duration of startup, shutdown, or malfunction periods are limited to 3 hours per occurrence, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data shall be dismissed or excluded from compliance calculations, but shall be recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.59b(d)(7).

(i) The startup period commences when the affected facility begins the continuous burning of municipal solid waste and does not include any warmup period when the affected facility is combusting fossil fuel or other nonmunicipal solid waste fuel, and no municipal solid waste is being fed to the combustor.

(ii) Continuous burning is the continuous, semicontinuous, or batch feeding of municipal solid waste for purposes of waste disposal, energy production, or providing heat to the combustion system in preparation for waste disposal or energy production. The use of municipal solid waste solely to provide thermal protection of the grate or hearth during the startup period when municipal solid waste is not being fed to the grate is not considered to be continuous burning.

(iii) For the purpose of compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limits in § 60.53b(a), if a loss of boiler water level control (e.g., boiler waterwall tube failure) or a loss of combustion air control (e.g., loss of combustion air fan, induced draft fan, combustion grate bar failure) is determined to be a malfunction, the duration of the malfunction period is limited to 15 hours per occurrence. During such periods of malfunction, monitoring data shall be dismissed or excluded from compliance calculations, but shall be recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions of § 60.59b(d)(7).
