###### Appendix E to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63 - Data Elements
####### Run-Level and Lab Data Elements for EPA test Methods 5, 5B, 5D, 26A, and 29.,i.e.,

19You must report the appropriate Source ID (Data Element 18.1) and the following data elements, as applicable, for each run of each performance stack test, PM CEMS correlation test, RATA, RRA, or RCA conducted using isokinetic EPA test Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 26A. If your EGU is oil-fired and you use EPA test Method 26A to conduct stack tests for both HCl and HF, you must report these data elements separately for each pollutant. When you use EPA test Method 29 to measure the individual HAP metals, total filterable HAP metals and total HAP metals, report only the run-level data elements (19.1, 19.3 through 19.30, and 19.38 through 19.41), and the point-level and lab data elements in sections 20 and 21 of this appendix:
