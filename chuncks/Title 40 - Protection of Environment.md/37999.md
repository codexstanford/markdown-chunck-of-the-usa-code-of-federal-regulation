######## Catalytic oxidizer

means an add-on air pollution control device that is designed specifically to destroy organic compounds in a process exhaust gas stream by catalytic incineration. A catalytic oxidizer includes a bed of catalyst media through which the process exhaust stream passes to promote combustion and incineration at a lower temperature than would be possible without the catalyst.
