(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fluindapyr, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 2 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 is to be determined by measuring the sum of fluindapyr, 3-(difluoromethyl)--(7-fluoro-1,1,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1-inden-4-yl)-1-methyl-1-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, and 3-(difluoromethyl)--(7-fluoro-1-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-l-inden-4-yl)-1-methyl-l-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluindapyr, in or on the commodity.
