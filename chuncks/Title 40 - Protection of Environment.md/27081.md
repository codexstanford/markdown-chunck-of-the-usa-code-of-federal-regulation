####### Outlet VOC concentration.

(1)Monitor the VOC concentrations at the exhaust point of the combustion device and record the output from the system. For sources monitoring the outlet VOC concentration established during the performance test, a data acquisition system shall record a concentration every 15 minutes and shall compute and record an average concentration each cycle (same time period or cycle as the performance test) and a 3-cycle block average concentration every third cycle. For sources monitoring the 1,000 ppmv VOC concentration for gasoline loading, a data acquisition system shall record a concentration every 15 minutes and shall compute and record an average concentration each hour and a 3-hour block average concentration every third hour. The owner or operator will install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a CEMS consistent with the requirements of PS 8 to measure the VOC concentration. The daily calibration requirements are required only on days when marine tank vessel loading operations occur.
