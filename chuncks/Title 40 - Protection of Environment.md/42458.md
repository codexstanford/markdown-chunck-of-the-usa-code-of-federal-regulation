###### § 75.4 Compliance dates.

(a) The provisions of this part apply to each existing Phase I and Phase II unit on February 10, 1993. For substitution or compensating units that are so designated under the Acid Rain permit which governs that unit and contains the approved substitution or reduced utilization plan, pursuant to § 72.41 or § 72.43 of this chapter, the provisions of this part become applicable upon the issuance date of the Acid Rain permit. For combustion sources seeking to enter the Opt-in Program in accordance with part 74 of this chapter, the provisions of this part become applicable upon the submission of an opt-in permit application in accordance with § 74.14 of this chapter. The provisions of this part for the monitoring, recording, and reporting of NOmass emissions become applicable on the deadlines specified in the applicable State or federal NOmass emission reduction program, to the extent these provisions are adopted as requirements under such a program. In accordance with § 75.20, the owner or operator of each existing affected unit shall ensure that all monitoring systems required by this part for monitoring SO, NO, CO, opacity, moisture and volumetric flow are installed and that all certification tests are completed no later than the following dates (except as provided in paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section):

(1) For a unit listed in table 1 of § 73.10(a) of this chapter, November 15, 1993.

(2) For a substitution or a compensating unit that is designated under an approved substitution plan or reduced utilization plan pursuant to § 72.41 or § 72.43 of this chapter, or for a unit that is designated an early election unit under an approved NOcompliance plan pursuant to part 76 of this chapter, that is not conditionally approved and that is effective for 1995, the earlier of the following dates:

(i) January 1, 1995; or

(ii) 90 days after the issuance date of the Acid Rain permit (or date of approval of permit revision) that governs the unit and contains the approved substitution plan, reduced utilization plan, or NOcompliance plan.

(3) For either a Phase II unit, other than a gas-fired unit or an oil-fired unit, or a substitution or compensating unit that is not a substitution or compensating unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section: January 1, 1995.

(4) For a gas-fired Phase II unit or an oil-fired Phase II unit, January 1, 1995, except that installation and certification tests for continuous emission monitoring systems for NOand COor excepted monitoring systems for NOunder appendix E or COestimation under appendix G of this part shall be completed as follows:

(i) For an oil-fired Phase II unit or a gas-fired Phase II unit located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, not later than July 1, 1995; or

(ii) For an oil-fired Phase II unit or a gas-fired Phase II unit not located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, not later than January 1, 1996.

(5) For combustion sources seeking to enter the Opt-in Program in accordance with part 74 of this chapter, the expiration date of a combustion source's opt-in permit under § 74.14(e) of this chapter.

(b) In accordance with § 75.20, the owner or operator of each new affected unit shall ensure that all monitoring systems required under this part for monitoring of SO, NO, CO, opacity, and volumetric flow are installed and all certification tests are completed on or before the later of the following dates:

(1) January 1, 1995, except that for a gas-fired unit or oil-fired unit located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, the date for installation and completion of all certification tests for NOand COmonitoring systems shall be July 1, 1995 and for a gas-fired unit or an oil-fired unit not located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, the date for installation and completion of all certification tests for NOand COmonitoring systems shall be January 1, 1996; or

(2) 180 calendar days after the date the unit commences commercial operation, notice of which date shall be provided under subpart G of this part.

(c) In accordance with § 75.20, the owner or operator of any unit affected under any paragraph of § 72.6(a)(3) (ii) through (vii) of this chapter shall ensure that all monitoring systems required under this part for monitoring of SO, NO, CO, opacity, and volumetric flow are installed and all certification tests are completed on or before the later of the following dates:

(1) January 1, 1995, except that for a gas-fired unit or oil-fired unit located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, the date for installation and completion of all certification tests for NOand COmonitoring systems shall be July 1, 1995 and for a gas-fired unit or an oil-fired unit not located in an ozone nonattainment area or the ozone transport region, the date for installation and completion of all certification tests for NOand COmonitoring systems shall be January 1, 1996; or

(2) 180 calendar days after the date on which the unit becomes subject to the requirements of the Acid Rain Program, notice of which date shall be provided under subpart G of this part.

(d) This paragraph (d) applies to affected units under the Acid Rain Program and to units subject to a State or Federal pollutant mass emissions reduction program that adopts the emission monitoring and reporting provisions of this part. In accordance with § 75.20, for an affected unit which, on the applicable compliance date, is either in long-term cold storage (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) or is shut down as the result of a planned outage or a forced outage, thereby preventing the required continuous monitoring system certification tests from being completed by the compliance date, the owner or operator shall provide notice of such unit storage or outage in accordance with § 75.61(a)(3) or § 75.61(a)(7), as applicable. For the planned and unplanned unit outages described in this paragraph (d), the owner or operator shall ensure that all of the continuous monitoring systems for SO, NO, CO, opacity, and volumetric flow rate required under this part (or under the applicable State or Federal mass emissions reduction program) are installed and that all required certification tests are completed no later than 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days (whichever occurs first) after the date that the unit recommences commercial operation, notice of which date shall be provided under § 75.61(a)(3) or § 75.61(a)(7), as applicable. The owner or operator shall determine and report SOconcentration, NOemission rate, COconcentration, and flow rate data (as applicable) for all unit operating hours after the applicable compliance date until all of the required certification tests are successfully completed, using either:

(1) The maximum potential concentration of SO(as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part), the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum potential COconcentration, as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part; or

(2) The conditional data validation provisions of § 75.20(b)(3); or

(3) Reference methods under § 75.22(b); or

(4) Another procedure approved by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under § 75.66.

(e) In accordance with § 75.20, if the owner or operator of an affected unit completes construction of a new stack or flue, or a flue gas desulfurization system or add-on NOemission controls, after the applicable deadline in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section:
