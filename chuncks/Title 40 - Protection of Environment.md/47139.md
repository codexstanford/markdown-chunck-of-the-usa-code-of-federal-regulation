()P= P- PPI (SP.GR./13.57).

(D) PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, kPa (in. fluid).

(E) SP.GR. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid, relative to water.

(iii) Plot Kas a function of venturi inlet depression. For sonic flow, Kwill have a relatively constant value. As pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and Kdecreases (is no longer constant). See Figure F78-7.

(iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region, calculate an average Kand the standard deviation.

(v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average K, take corrective action.
