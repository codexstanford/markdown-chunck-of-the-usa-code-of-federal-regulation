() 100-year flood for a low hazard potential CCR surface impoundment.

(vi) Hydraulic structures underlying the base of the CCR unit or passing through the dike of the CCR unit that maintain structural integrity and are free of significant deterioration, deformation, distortion, bedding deficiencies, sedimentation, and debris which may negatively affect the operation of the hydraulic structure; and

(vii) For CCR units with downstream slopes which can be inundated by the pool of an adjacent water body, such as a river, stream or lake, downstream slopes that maintain structural stability during low pool of the adjacent water body or sudden drawdown of the adjacent water body.

(2) The periodic assessment described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must identify any structural stability deficiencies associated with the CCR unit in addition to recommending corrective measures. If a deficiency or a release is identified during the periodic assessment, the owner or operator unit must remedy the deficiency or release as soon as feasible and prepare documentation detailing the corrective measures taken.

(3) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must obtain a certification from a qualified professional engineer stating that the initial assessment and each subsequent periodic assessment was conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section.
