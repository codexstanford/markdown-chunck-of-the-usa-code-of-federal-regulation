####### Four-bag FTP equations.

(1)If the 4-bag sampling method is used, manufacturers may use the equations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to determine city and highway COand carbon-related exhaust emissions values. If this method is chosen, it must be used to determine both city and highway COemissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions. Optionally, the following calculations may be used, provided that they are used to determine both city and highway COand carbon-related exhaust emissions values:
