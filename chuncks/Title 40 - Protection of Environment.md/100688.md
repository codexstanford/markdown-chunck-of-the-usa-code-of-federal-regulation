###### ยง 1039.510 Which duty cycles do I use for transient testing?

(a) Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with one of the following transient duty cycles to determine whether it meets the transient emission standards in ยง 1039.101(a):

(1) For variable-speed engines, use the transient duty cycle described in appendix VI of this part.

(2) [Reserved]

(b) The transient test sequence consists of an initial run through the transient duty cycle from a cold start, 20 minutes with no engine operation, then a final run through the same transient duty cycle. Calculate the official transient emission result from the following equation:
