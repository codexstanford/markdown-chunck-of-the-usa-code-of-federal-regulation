####### ยง 63.9324 How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits during the performance test?
######## Emission capture system.

(c)For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of ยง 63.9322(a), establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.

(1) During the capture efficiency determination required by ยง 63.9310, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device and the add-on control device inlet.

(2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.
