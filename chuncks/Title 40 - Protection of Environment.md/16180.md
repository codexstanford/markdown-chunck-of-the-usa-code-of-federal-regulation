####### Order granting or denying request for cross-examination.

(b)As expeditiously as practicable after receipt of all requests for cross-examination under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the hearing panel, shall issue an order either granting or denying each such request, which shall be disseminated to all persons requesting cross-examination and all persons to be cross-examined. If any request for cross-examination is granted, the order shall specify:

(1) The issues as to which cross-examination is granted;

(2) The persons to be cross-examined on each issue;

(3) The persons allowed to conduct cross-examination;

(4) Time limits for the examination of witnesses; and

(5) The date, time and place of the supplementary hearing at which cross-examination shall take place. In issuing this ruling, the Presiding Officer may determine that one or more participants have the same or similar interests and that to prevent unduly repetitious cross-examination, they should be required to choose a single representative for purposes of cross-examination. In such a case, the order shall simply assign time for cross-examination by that single representative without identifying the representative further.
