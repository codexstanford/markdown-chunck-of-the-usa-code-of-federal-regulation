####### non-continuous discharger

(f) Ais a plant which does not discharge pollutants during specific periods of time for reasons other than treatment plant upset, such periods being at least 24 hours in duration. A typical example of a non-continuous discharger is a plant where wastewaters are routinely stored for periods in excess of 24 hours to be treated on a batch basis. For non-continuous discharging direct discharging plants, NPDES permit authorities shall apply the mass-based annual average effluent limitations or standards and the concentration-based maximum day and maximum for monthly average effluent limitations or standards established in the regulations. POTWs may elect to establish concentration-based standards for non-continuous discharges to POTWs. They may do so by establishing concentration-based pretreatment standards equivalent to the mass-based standards provided in §§ 464.15, 464.16, 464.25, 464.26, 464.35, 464.36, 464.45, and 464.46 of the regulations. Equivalent concentration standards may be established by following the procedures outlined in § 464.03(b).
