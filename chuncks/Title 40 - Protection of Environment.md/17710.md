####### Temporary boiler

means any gaseous or liquid fuel-fired steam generating unit that is designed to, and is capable of, being carried or moved from one location to another by means of, for example, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dollies, trailers, or platforms. A steam generating unit is not a temporary boiler if any one of the following conditions exists:

(1) The equipment is attached to a foundation.

(2) The steam generating unit or a replacement remains at a location for more than 180 consecutive days. Any temporary boiler that replaces a temporary boiler at a location and performs the same or similar function will be included in calculating the consecutive time period.

(3) The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least 2 years, and operates at that facility for at least 3 months each year.

(4) The equipment is moved from one location to another in an attempt to circumvent the residence time requirements of this definition.
