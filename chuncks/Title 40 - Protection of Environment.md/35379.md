######## Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60).

(2)For coatings, you may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. (Method 24 is not appropriate for those coatings with a water content that would result in an effective detection limit greater than the applicable emission limit.) One of the voluntary consensus standards in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) may be used as an alternative to using Method 24.

(i) ASTM Method D2111-10 (Reapproved 2015), "Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity and Density of Halogenated Organic Solvents and Their Admixtures," (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14);

(ii) ASTM Method D2369-10 (Reapproved 2015), "Standard Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings," (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14);

(iii) ASTM Method D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014), "Standard Test Method for Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings," (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14); and

(iv) ASTM Method D6093-97 (Reapproved 2016), "Standard Test Method for Percent Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings Using a Helium Gas Pycnometer," (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
