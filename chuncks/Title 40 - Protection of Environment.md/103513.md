######## Sample media.

(a)The sampling system uses two types of sample media in series: The first to simultaneously capture the PM and associated particle phase SVOCs, and a second to capture SVOCs that remain in the gas phase, as follows:

(1) For capturing PM, we recommend using pure quartz filters with no binder if you are not analyzing separately for SVOCs in gas and particle phases. If you are analyzing separately, you must use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters with PTFE support. Select the filter diameter to minimize filter change intervals, accounting for the expected PM emission rate, sample flow rate. Note that when repeating test cycles to increase sample mass, you may replace the filter without replacing the sorbent or otherwise disassembling the batch sampler. In those cases, include all filters in the extraction.

(2) For capturing gaseous SVOCs, utilize XAD-2 resin with or without PUF plugs. Note that two PUF plugs are typically used to contain the XAD-2 resin in the sorbent module.
