####### Calculate flow-weighted average of Fr values and compare to mass destruction efficiency.

(9)Compare the mass destruction efficiency (calculated in Equation WW 7) to the required efficiency as specified in ยง 63.138(e). If complying with ยง 63.138(e)(1), compliance is demonstrated if the mass destruction efficiency is 99 percent or greater. If complying with ยง 63.138(e)(2), compliance is demonstrated if the mass destruction efficiency is greater than or equal to the flow-weighted average of the Fr value calculated in Equation WW8.
