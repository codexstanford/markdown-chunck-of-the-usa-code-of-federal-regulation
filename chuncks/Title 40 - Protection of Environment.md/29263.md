######## Dilution steam blowdown waste stream

means any continuously flowing process wastewater stream resulting from the quench and compression of cracked gas (the cracking furnace effluent) at an ethylene production unit and is discharged from the unit. This stream typically includes the aqueous or oily-water stream that results from condensation of dilution steam (in the cracking furnace quench system), blowdown from dilution steam generation systems, and aqueous streams separated from the process between the cracking furnace and the cracked gas dehydrators. The dilution steam blowdown waste stream does not include blowdown that has not contacted HAP-containing process materials. Before July 6, 2023, the dilution steam blowdown waste stream does not include dilution steam blowdown streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. Beginning on July 6, 2023, the dilution steam blowdown streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges are included in the definition of dilution steam blowdown waste stream.
