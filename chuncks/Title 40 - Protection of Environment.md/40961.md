####### Design evaluation.

(i)The design evaluation shall include documentation demonstrating that the control device being used achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum storage vessel filling or transfer loading rate. This documentation is to include a description of the gas stream that enters the control device, including flow and regulated material content; and additionally for storage vessels, the effects of varying liquid level conditions; and the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section, as applicable. This documentation shall be submitted with the Initial Compliance Status Report as specified in ยง 65.165(b).

(A) The efficiency determination is to include consideration of all vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.

(B) If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 &#xB0;C is used to meet the emission reduction requirement specified in ยง 65.42(b)(5) for storage vessels, or ยง 65.83(a)(1) for transfer racks, documentation that those conditions exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(C) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section for enclosed combustion devices, the design evaluation shall include the estimated autoignition temperature of the stream being combusted, the flow rate of the stream, the combustion temperature, and the residence time at the combustion temperature.

(D) For carbon adsorbers, the design evaluation shall include the estimated affinity of the regulated pollutant vapors for carbon, the amount of carbon in each bed, the number of beds, the humidity, the temperature, the flow rate of the inlet stream and, if applicable, the desorption schedule, the regeneration stream pressure or temperature, and the flow rate of the regeneration stream. For vacuum desorption, pressure drop shall be included.

(E) For condensers, the design evaluation shall include the final temperature of the stream vapors, the type of condenser, and the design flow rate of the emission stream.
