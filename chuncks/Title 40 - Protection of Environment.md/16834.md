###### Micro-scale.

(1)This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons and traffic corridors where the general public would be exposed to maximum concentrations from mobile sources. In some circumstances, the micro-scale is appropriate for particulate sites. SLAMS sites measured at the micro-scale level should, however, be limited to urban sites that are representative of long-term human exposure and of many such microenvironments in the area. In general, micro-scale particulate matter sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the micro-scale. In the latter case, the micro-scale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at micro-scale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.
