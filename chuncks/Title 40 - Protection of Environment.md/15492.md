###### Operation period.

6.3.4Other than that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance manual, the measurement system shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment during the 168-hour performance and operational test period. If the measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment other than as specified above during the 168-hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test, except for the 168-hour field test period, which were satisfactorily completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
