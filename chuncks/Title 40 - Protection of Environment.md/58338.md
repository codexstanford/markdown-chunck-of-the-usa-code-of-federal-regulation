####### Meetings with persons or parties outside of government.

(b)Requests by responsible persons or parties outside of government to meet with Agency personnel concerning a Registration Standard under development should be directed in writing to the Registration Division. Reasonable requests will ordinarily be granted on a timely basis. EPA will decide the time and place of such meetings, and the Agency personnel who will attend. EPA may decline to meet with persons or parties who assert unreasonable claims of confidential business information for the purpose of circumventing the docketing procedures in ยง 155.32. EPA may also decline to meet if the number or frequency of meetings would delay unduly the issuance of the Registration Standard. Further, no person or party outside government will be accorded special or preferential access to Agency pesticide decisionmaking or to the Agency's decisional process.
