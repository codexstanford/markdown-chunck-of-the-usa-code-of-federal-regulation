###### Three-dimensional Probes.

6.1The 3-D probes as specified in subsections 6.1.1 through 6.1.3 below qualify for use based on comprehensive wind tunnel and field studies involving both inter-and intra-probe comparisons by multiple test teams. Other types of probes shall not be used unless approved by the Administrator. Each 3-D probe shall have a unique identification number or code permanently marked on the main probe sheath. The minimum recommended diameter of the sensing head of any probe used under this method is 2.5 cm (1 in.). Each probe shall be calibrated prior to use according to the procedures in section 10. Manufacturer-supplied calibration data shall be used as example information only, except when the manufacturer calibrates the 3-D probe as specified in section 10 and provides complete documentation.
