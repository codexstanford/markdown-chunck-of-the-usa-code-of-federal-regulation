(ii) A copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the receiving facility sends to the foreign exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that it completed processing the waste shipment;

(iii) For the receiving facility that performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC3, or disposal operations D13 through D15 (recovery and disposal operations defined in ยง 262.81), a copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the final recovery or disposal facility sent to it for at least three (3) years from the date that the final recovery or disposal facility completed processing the waste shipment; and

(3) Importers and receiving facilities may satisfy these recordkeeping requirements by retaining electronically submitted documents in the importer's or receiving facility's account on EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector. No importer or receiving facility may be held liable for the inability to produce such documents for inspection under this section if the importer or receiving facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system for which the importer or receiving facility bears no responsibility.

(4) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.
