####### C

-equivalent means a convention of expressing HC concentrations based on the total number of carbon atoms present, such that the C-equivalent of a molar HC concentration equals the molar concentration multiplied by the mean number of carbon atoms in each HC molecule. For example, the C-equivalent of 10 µmol/mol of propane (CH) is 30 µmol/mol. C-equivalent molar values may be denoted as "ppmC" in the standard-setting part. Molar mass may also be expressed on a Cbasis. Note that calculating HC masses from molar concentrations and molar masses is only valid where they are each expressed on the same carbon basis.
