###### 3.14 Polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners.

Any or all chlorinated dibenzofuran congeners. There are ten 2,3,7,8 substituted PCDF congeners and four PCDF homolog groups listed in Table 23-1 of this method. This method does not measure mono- through tri-PCDF and includes non-2,3,7,8 substituted congeners in the total homolog categories.

3.14.1 Tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TeCDF). Any or all 38 tetrachlorinated dibenzofuran isomers.

3.14.2 Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF). Any or all 28 pentachlorinated dibenzofuran isomers.

3.14.3 Hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF). Any or all 16 hexachlorinated dibenzofuran isomers.

3.14.4 Heptachlordibenzofuran (HpCDF). Any or all four heptachlorinated dibenzofuran isomers.

3.14.5 Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). Dibenzofuran fully chlorinated with eight chlorine atom substituents replacing hydrogen in the parent compound.
