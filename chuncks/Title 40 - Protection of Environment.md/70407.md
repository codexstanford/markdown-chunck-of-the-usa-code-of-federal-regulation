###### Level of contamination.

3.3.2.1Evaluate the population served by water from a point of withdrawal based on the level of contamination for that point of withdrawal. Use the applicable factor: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, or potential contamination.

If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release for a point of withdrawal and there is no observed release by direct observation for that point of withdrawal, evaluate that point of withdrawal using the potential contamination factor in section 3.3.2.4. If there is an observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for that point of withdrawal. However, if one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release for the point of withdrawal, determine which factor (Level I or Level II concentrations) applies to that point of withdrawal as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination. Evaluate the point of withdrawal using the Level I concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.2 or the Level II concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.3, as appropriate.

For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 3.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
