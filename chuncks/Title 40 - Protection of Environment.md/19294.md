###### ยง 60.562-1 Standards: Process emissions.
####### Polystyrene.

(b)Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by ยง 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line using a continuous process shall:

(1) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section by complying with one of the following:

(i) Not allow continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.0036 kg TOC/Mg (0.0072 lb TOC/ton) product; or

(ii) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final condenser in the material recovery section to exceed -25 &#xB0;C (-13 &#xB0;F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction; or

(iii) Comply with ยง 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C).

(2) If continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section are routed through an existing emergency vapor recovery system, then compliance with these standards is required when the emergency vapor recovery system undergoes modification, reconstruction, or replacement. In such instances, compliance with these standards shall be achieved no later than 180 days after completion of the modification, reconstruction, or replacement.
