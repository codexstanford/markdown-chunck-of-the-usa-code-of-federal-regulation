###### ยง 127.2 Definitions.
####### Initial recipient of electronic NPDES information from NPDES-regulated facilities (initial recipient),e.g.,

(b)means the entity (EPA or the state, tribe, or territory authorized by EPA to implement the NPDES program) that is the designated entity for receiving electronic NPDES data. Section 127.27 outlines the process for designating the initial recipient of electronic NPDES information from NPDES-regulated facilities. EPA must become the initial recipient of electronic NPDES information from NPDES-regulated facilities if the state, tribe, or territory does not collect the data required in appendix A to this part and does not consistently maintain timely, accurate, complete, and consistent data transfers in compliance with this part and 40 CFR part 3. Timely means that the authorized state, tribe, or territory submits these data transfers (see the data elements in appendix A to this part) to EPA within 40 days of when the authorized program completed the activity or received a report submitted by a regulated entity. For example, the data regarding a state inspection of an NPDES-regulated entity that is finalized by the state on October 5th must be electronically transferred to EPA no later than November 14th of that same year (40 days after October 5th).
