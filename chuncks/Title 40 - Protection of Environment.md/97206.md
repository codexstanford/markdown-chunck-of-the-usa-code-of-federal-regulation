(B) The final report shall include a calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC), 100 x PEC, and 1,000 x PEC for each isomer. PEC shall be calculated by using results from the indirect photolysis studies and solving the following equations for the appropriate isomer:-pda: PECo = 0.3629 + 1.0468 log t 1/2;-pda: PECm = 0.6830 + 1.9702 log t 1/2;-pda: PECp = 0.0085 + 0.0024 log t 1/2, where PEC is the predicted concentration in ppb and t 1/2 is the half-life for oxidation (i.e., indirect photolysis) expressed in minutes. PEC, 100 x PEC, and 1,000 x PEC shall be used in the decision logic described in paragraph (e) of this section.
