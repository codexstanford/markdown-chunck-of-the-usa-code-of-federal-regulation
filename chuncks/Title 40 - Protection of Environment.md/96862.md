####### iii,Clearing and embedding.

()After dehydration, tissue specimens shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast except for the sural nerve which should be embedded in plastic. Multiple tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded together in one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be labeled to provide unequivocal identification. A method for plastic embedding is described by Spencer et al. in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
