####### Control requirements for halogenated vent streams that are controlled by combustion devices.

(g)If a combustion device is used to comply with the provisions of §§ 63.1253 (storage tanks), 63.1254 (process vents), 63.1256(h) (wastewater vent streams) for a halogenated vent stream, then the vent stream shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device such as, but not limited to, a scrubber, before it is discharged to the atmosphere. The halogen reduction device must reduce emissions by the amounts specified in either paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) A halogen reduction device after the combustion control device must reduce overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens, as defined in § 63.1251, by 95 percent or to a concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv.

(2) A halogen reduction device located before the combustion control device must reduce the halogen atom content of the vent stream to a concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv.
