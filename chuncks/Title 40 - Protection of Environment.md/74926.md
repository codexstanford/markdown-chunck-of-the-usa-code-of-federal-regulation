###### i.e.,

(e) Obtain the critical value (C) from Table 1. When 12 monthly data are available for both baseline and monitoring (n = 12 and m = 12), the critical value C is 99.

(f) Compare C to S. If Sis less than C, then the monitoring loadings have exceeded the baseline loadings.

(a) When n and m are less than 21, use Table 1.

In order to find the appropriate critical value, match column with correct n (number of baseline observations) to row with correct m (number of monitoring observations).*

(b) When n or m is greater than 20 and there are few ties, calculate an approximate critical value using the following formula and round the result to the next larger integer. Let N = n + m.

For example, this calculation provides a result of 295.76 for n = m = 20, and a result of 96.476 for n = m = 12. Rounding up produces approximate critical values of 296 and 97.

(c) When n or m is greater than 20 and there are many ties, calculate an approximate critical value using the following formula and round the result to the next larger integer. Let S be the sum of the squares of the ranks or average ranks of all N observations. Let N = n + m.

In the preceding formula, calculate V using
