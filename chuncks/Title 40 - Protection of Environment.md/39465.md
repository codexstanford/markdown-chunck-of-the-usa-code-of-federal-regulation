######## Annual metal melt capacity,

for new affected sources, means the lower of the aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation capacity, assuming 8,760 operating hours per year or, if applicable, the maximum permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation production rate for the melting operation calculated on an annual basis. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melting operation rates that are not specified on an annual basis must be annualized assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year of operation. If the permit limits the operating hours of the melting operation(s) or foundry, then the permitted operating hours are used to annualize the maximum permitted aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous metal melt production rate. The annual metal melt capacity does not include the melt capacity for ferrous metal melted in iron or steel foundry melting operations that are co-located with aluminum, copper, or other nonferrous melting operations or the nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations.
