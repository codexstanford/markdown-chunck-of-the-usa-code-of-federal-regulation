(2)(i) For each CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that was allocated for a given control period and initially recorded in a given source's compliance account, one CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance that was allocated for the same or an earlier control period and initially recorded in the same or any other Allowance Management System account must be surrendered in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section.

(iii) As soon as practicable after completion of the deductions under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will identify for each source described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amounts, if any, of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for each control period after 2020 and recorded in the source's compliance account for which the corresponding surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section have not been satisfied and will send a notification concerning such identified amounts to the designated representative for the source.

(iv) With regard to each source for which unsatisfied surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section remain after the deductions under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section:

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, not later than September 15, 2021, the owners and operators of the source shall hold sufficient CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances eligible to satisfy such unsatisfied surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section in the source's compliance account.

(B) With regard to any portion of such unsatisfied surrender requirements that apply to former owners and operators of the source pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, not later than September 15, 2021, such former owners and operators shall hold sufficient CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances eligible to satisfy such portion of the unsatisfied surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section either in the source's compliance account or in another Allowance Management System account identified to the Administrator on or before such date in a submission by the authorized account representative for such account.

(v) When making deductions under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iv) of this section to address the surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for a given source:

(A) The Administrator will make deductions to address any surrender requirements with regard to first the 2021 control period, then the 2022 control period, then the 2023 control period, and finally the 2024 control period.

(B) When making deductions to address the surrender requirements with regard to a given control period, the Administrator will first deduct CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for such given control period and will then deduct CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for each successively earlier control period in sequence.

(C) When deducting CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for a given control period from a given Allowance Management System account, the Administrator will first deduct CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances initially recorded in the account under § 97.821 (if the account is a compliance account) in the order of recordation and will then deduct CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances recorded in the account under § 97.526(d) or § 97.823 in the order of recordation.

(4)(i) To the extent the surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section corresponding to any CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for a control period after 2020 and initially recorded in a given source's compliance account have not been fully satisfied through the deductions under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, as soon as practicable on or after November 15, 2021, the Administrator will deduct such initially recorded CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances from any Allowance Management System accounts in which such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances are held, making such deductions in any order determined by the Administrator, until all such surrender requirements for such source have been satisfied or until all such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances have been deducted, except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.

(ii) If no person with an ownership interest in a given CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance as of January 31, 2021 was an owner or operator of the source in whose compliance account such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance was initially recorded, was a direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of an owner or operator of such source, or was directly or indirectly under common ownership with an owner or operator of such source, the Administrator will not deduct such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, each owner or operator of a source shall be deemed to be a person with an ownership interest in any CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance held in that source's compliance account. The limitation established by this paragraph on the deductibility of certain CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section shall not be construed as a waiver of the surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section corresponding to such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances.

(iii) Not less than 45 days before the planned date for any deductions under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will send a notification to the authorized account representative for the Allowance Management System account from which such deductions will be made identifying the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances to be deducted and the data upon which the Administrator has relied and specifying a process for submission of any objections to such data. Any objections must be submitted to the Administrator not later than 15 days before the planned date for such deductions as indicated in such notification.

(5) To the extent the surrender requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section corresponding to any CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for a control period after 2020 and initially recorded in a given source's compliance account have not been fully satisfied through the deductions under paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section:

(i) The persons identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section with regard to such source and each such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance shall pay any fine, penalty, or assessment or comply with any other remedy imposed under the Clean Air Act; and

(ii) Each such CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance, and each day in such control period, shall constitute a separate violation of this subpart and the Clean Air Act.

(6) The Administrator will record in the appropriate Allowance Management System accounts all deductions of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances under paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section.
