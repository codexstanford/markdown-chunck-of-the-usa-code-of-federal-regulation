####### Route of administration.

(iii)(A) The test substance or vehicle is usually administered orally by intubation.

(B) If another route of administration is used, for example, when the route of administration is based upon the principal route of potential human exposure, the tester shall provide justification and reasoning for its selection, and appropriate modifications may be necessary. Care should be taken to minimize stress on the maternal animals. For materials administered by inhalation, whole-body exposure is preferable to nose-only exposure due to the stress of restraint required for nose-only exposure.

(C) The test substance shall be administered at approximately the same time each day.

(D) When administered by gavage or dermal application, the dose to each animal shall be based on the most recent individual body weight determination.
