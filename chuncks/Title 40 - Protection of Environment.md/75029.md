###### Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435 - Determination of the Amount of Non-Aqueous Drilling Fluid (NAF) Base Fluid From Drill Cuttings by a Retort Chamber (Derived From API Recommended Practice 13B-2) (EPA Method 1674)
####### i.e.

Small volume NAF-cuttings discharges which do not occur during a NAF-cuttings discharge sampling interval (, displaced interfaces, accumulated solids in sand traps, pit clean-out solids, or centrifuge discharges while cutting mud weight) shall be mass averaged with the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (see Equation 8 of this appendix). An additional sampling interval shall be added to the calculation of the weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF). The mass fraction of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (X) will be determined by dividing the mass of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (F) by the total mass of NAF-cuttings discharges for the well drilling operation (G+ F).

The mass of small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (F) shall be determined by multiplying the density of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (œÅ) times the volume of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (V).

The density of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges shall be measured. The volume of small volume discharges (V) shall be either: (a) Be measured or (b) use default values of 10 bbl of SBF for each interface loss and 75 bbl of SBM for pit cleanout per well.

The total mass of NAF-cuttings discharges for the well (G) shall be either: (a) Measured; or (b) calculated by multiplying 1.0 plus the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values [see Equation 8 of this appendix] times the total hole volume (V) for all NAF well sections times a default value for the density the formation of 2.5 g/cm(396.9 kg/bbl).

The total hole volume of NAF well sections (V) will be calculated as:

For wells where small volume discharges associated with cuttings are made, %BFbecomes:
