(g)The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator written notification as follows:

(1) A notification of the date the CMS performance evaluation under § 63.8(e) is scheduled to begin, submitted simultaneously with the notification of the performance test date required under § 63.7(b). If no performance test is required, or if the requirement to conduct a performance test has been waived for an affected source under § 63.7(h), the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing of the date of the performance evaluation at least 60 calendar days before the evaluation is scheduled to begin;

(2) A notification that COMS data results will be used to determine compliance with the applicable opacity emission standard during a performance test required by § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 or other opacity emissions test method data, as allowed by § 63.6(h)(7)(ii), if compliance with an opacity emission standard is required for the source by a relevant standard. The notification shall be submitted at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to begin; and

(3) A notification that the criterion necessary to continue use of an alternative to relative accuracy testing, as provided by § 63.8(f)(6), has been exceeded. The notification shall be delivered or postmarked not later than 10 days after the occurrence of such exceedance, and it shall include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions.
