####### Superheated part technology

means a system that is part of the continuous web process that heats the continuous web part either directly or indirectly to a temperature above the boiling point of the cleaning solvent. This could include a process step, such as a tooling die that heats the part as it is processed, as long as the part remains superheated through the cleaning machine.
