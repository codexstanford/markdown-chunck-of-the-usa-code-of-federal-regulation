####### Durability Procedure

2.

a. Install the replacement ignition coil in the ignition system using the applicable rotor, cap, capacitor, breaker points, and primary resistor.

b. Operate the circuit with a regulated power supply of 14.0 +/-.5 volts DC connected to the primary at an ambient temperature of 70 &#xB0;C (158 &#xB0;F) at 1750 +/-50 distributor rpm for a duration of 200 hours. After each 50 hour interval, run the distributor for 5 minutes with one open-circuit spark gap instead of a 12KV gap.

c. The ignition coil shall perform throughout the test without any evidence of coil failure which would result in the loss of the spark in the 12 KV spark gap.

d. Repeat Step 1.c. above. The open-circuit output voltage must be at least 90% of that measured in 1.c.
