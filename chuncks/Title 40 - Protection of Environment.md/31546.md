####### ยง 63.1348 Compliance requirements.
######## Mercury Compliance.

(7)(i) If you are subject to limitations on mercury emissions in ยง 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance using the monitoring methods and procedures in ยง 63.1350(k). If you use an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system to determine ongoing compliance, use the procedures described in ยง 63.1348(a)(5) to assign hourly mercury concentration values and to calculate rolling 30 operating day emissions rates. Since you assign the mercury concentration measured with the sorbent trap to each relevant hour respectively for each operating day of the integrated period, you may schedule the sorbent trap change periods to any time of the day (i.e., the sorbent trap replacement need not be scheduled at 12:00 midnight nor must the sorbent trap replacements occur only at integral 24-hour intervals).

(ii) Mercury must be measured either upstream of the coal mill or in the coal mill stack.
