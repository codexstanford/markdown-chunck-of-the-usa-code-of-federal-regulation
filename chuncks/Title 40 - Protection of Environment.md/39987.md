11.3.4.2 If the centerline does not provide a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven (when standpipes are longer than 15 feet), the observer may conduct the traverse farther from (rather than closer to) the offtake systems.

11.3.4.3 Upon noting a leak from an offtake system during a traverse, record the oven number. Resume the traverse. If the oven is dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization and VE are observed, note this under "Comments" for that particular oven.

11.3.4.4 If any part or parts of an offtake system have VE, count it as one emitting offtake system. Each stationary jumper pipe is considered a single offtake system.
