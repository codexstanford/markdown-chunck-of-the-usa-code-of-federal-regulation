(6) Ifis not within +/-1% of, the candidate cycle must be adjusted to meet this criterion using the following steps. It should be noted that if theis outside of the criteria it will usually be lower than the.

(i) Increase the duration of the stable portion of the regeneration profile, which is defined as the portion of the regeneration profile where the temperature has completed ramping and is being controlled to a stationary target temperature. Note that this will increase the number of hours of regeneration time. You must compensate for this by decreasing the total number of normal operation (non-regeneration) hours in the cycle. Recalculate the duration of all the normal operation modes. You may not increase the duration of the stable portion of the regeneration profile by more than a factor of 2. If you reach this limit and you still do not meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, proceed to the next step.
