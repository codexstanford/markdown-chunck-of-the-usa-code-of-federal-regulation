4.1.2.4Calculate the relative accuracy (RA) of the sorbent trap monitoring system, on a Âµg/scm basis, as described in section 12 of Performance Specification (PS) 2 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter (see Equations 2-3 through 2-6 of PS2). For purposes of calculating the relative accuracy, ensure that the reference method and monitoring system data are on a consistent moisture basis, either wet or dry.The main and alternative RATA performance specifications in Table A-1 for Hg CEMS also apply to the sorbent trap monitoring system.
