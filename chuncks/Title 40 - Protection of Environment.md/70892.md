###### 5.3.7 Multi-regional responses.

(a) If a discharge moves from the area covered by one ACP or RCP into another area, the authority for response actions should likewise shift. If a discharge affects areas covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.

(b) There shall be only one OSC at any time during the course of a response operation. Should a discharge affect two or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC. The RRT shall designate the OSC if the RRT member agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the designation.
