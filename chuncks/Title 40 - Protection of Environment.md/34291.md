######## Formulation data.

(3)You may use formulation data to determine the organic HAP mass fraction of a coating material. Formulation data may be provided to the owner or operator by the manufacturer of the material. In the event of an inconsistency between Method 311 (appendix A to this part) test data and a facility's formulation data, and the Method 311 test value is higher, the Method 311 data will govern. Formulation data may be used provided that the information represents all organic HAP present at a level equal to or greater than 0.1 percent for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200 and equal to or greater than 1.0 percent for other organic HAP compounds in any raw material used.
