####### Engine misfire malfunction criteria,Misfire causing catalyst damage.

(ii)-(A)The manufacturer must determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 200 revolution increments for each engine speed and load condition that would result in a temperature that causes catalyst damage. If this percentage of misfire is exceeded, it shall be considered a malfunction that must be detected. For every engine speed and load condition for which this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than five percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at five percent. The manufacturer may use a longer interval than 200 revolutions but only for determining, on a given drive cycle, the first misfire exceedance as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the interval is not so long that catalyst damage would occur prior to the interval being elapsed.
