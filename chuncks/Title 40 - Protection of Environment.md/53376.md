4.2.1The USCG planning level that corresponds to EPA's "medium discharge" is termed "the maximum most probable discharge." The USCG rule found at 33 CFR part 154 defines "the maximum most probable discharge" as a discharge of 1,200 barrels (50,400 gallons) or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport petroleum oils must compare calculated discharge volumes for a medium discharge and a maximum most probable discharge, and plan for whichever quantity is greater.
