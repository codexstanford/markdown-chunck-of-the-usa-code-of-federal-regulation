####### Development of adjustment factors.

(1)Manufacturers must develop separate pairs of adjustment factors (an upward adjustment factor and a downward adjustment factor) for each pollutant based on measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency. Adjustment factors may be carried-over to subsequent model years or carried-across to other engine families only where the Administrator determines that such carry-over or carry-across is consistent with good engineering judgment. Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but manufacturers may develop separate adjustment factors for different engine configurations within an engine family. All adjustment factors for regeneration are additive.
