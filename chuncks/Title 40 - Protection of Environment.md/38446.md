####### Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems.,i.e.,,i.e.,

2.2In the electronic monitoring plan described in section 7 of this appendix, you must create and designate a primary monitoring system for PM and for each additional parameter (stack gas flow rate, COor Oconcentration, stack gas moisture content, as applicable). The primary system must be used to report hourly PM concentration values when the system is able to provide quality-assured data,when the system is "in control." However, to increase data availability in the event of a primary monitoring system outage, you may install, operate, maintain, and calibrate a redundant backup monitoring system. A redundant backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack location and is kept on "hot standby" in case the primary monitoring system is unable to provide quality-assured data. You must represent each redundant backup system as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. You must certify each redundant backup monitoring system according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this appendix. In addition, each redundant monitoring system must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in section 5 of this appendix.
