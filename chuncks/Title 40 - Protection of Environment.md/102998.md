(iv) You may use a manufacturer-declaredinstead of the measured. If you do this, you may also measure the warm high-idle speed as described in this paragraph (b)(6) before running the operating point and speed sweeps specified in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section.

(7) For engines with a low-speed governor, if a nonzero idle torque is representative of in-use operation, operate the engine at warm idle with the manufacturer-declared idle torque. Set the operator demand to minimum, use the dynamometer to target the declared idle torque, and allow the engine to govern the speed. Measure this speed and use it as the warm idle speed for cycle generation in ยง 1065.512. We recommend recording at least 30 values of speed and using the mean of those values. If you identify multiple warm idle torques under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, measure the warm idle speed at each torque. You may map the idle governor at multiple load levels and use this map to determine the measured warm idle speed at the declared idle torque(s).
