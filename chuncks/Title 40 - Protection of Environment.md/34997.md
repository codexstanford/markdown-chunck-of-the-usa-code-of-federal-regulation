Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period (or over the period that wastewater is being discharged from a batch process if it is shorter than a 1-hour period). Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and a performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs.
