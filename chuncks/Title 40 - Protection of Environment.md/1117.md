##### Subpart E - Initial Decision, Motion To Reopen a Hearing, and Motion To Set Aside a Default Order
###### ยง 22.28 Motion to reopen a hearing or to set aside a default order.
####### Disposition of motion to reopen a hearing.

(2)Within 15 days following the service of a motion to reopen a hearing, any other party to the proceeding may file with the Headquarters or Regional Hearing Clerk, as appropriate, and serve on all other parties a response. A reopened hearing shall be governed by the applicable sections of these Consolidated Rules of Practice. The timely filing of a motion to reopen a hearing shall automatically toll the running of the time periods for an initial decision becoming final under ยง 22.27(c), for appeal under ยง 22.30, and for the Environmental Appeals Board to elect to review the initial decision on its own initiative pursuant to ยง 22.30(b). These time periods begin again in full when the Presiding Officer serves an order denying the motion to reopen the hearing or an amended decision. The Presiding Officer may summarily deny subsequent motions to reopen a hearing filed by the same party if the Presiding Officer determines that the motion was filed to delay the finality of the decision.
