####### § 63.1209 What are the monitoring requirements?
######## Feedrate of mercury.

(1)(i) For incinerators and solid fuel boilers, when complying with the mercury emission standards under §§ 63.1203, 63.1216 and 63.1219, you must establish a 12-hour rolling average limit for the total feedrate of mercury in all feedstreams as the average of the test run averages.

(ii) For liquid fuel boilers, when complying with the mercury emission standards of § 63.1217, you must establish a rolling average limit for the mercury feedrate as follows on an averaging period not to exceed an annual rolling average:

(A) You must calculate a mercury system removal efficiency for each test run and calculate the average system removal efficiency of the test run averages. If emissions exceed the mercury emission standard during the comprehensive performance test, it is not a violation because the averaging period for the mercury emission standard is (not-to-exceed) one year and compliance is based on compliance with the mercury feedrate limit with an averaging period not-to-exceed one year.

(B) If you burn hazardous waste with a heating value of 10,000 Btu/lb or greater, you must calculate the mercury feedrate limit as follows:
