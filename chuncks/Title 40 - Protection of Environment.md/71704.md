##### ยง 403.13 Variances from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors.
###### Criteria applicable to less stringent limits.

(2)A variance request for the establishment of limits less stringent than required by the Standard shall be approved only if:

(i) The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference;

(ii) The alternative limit will not result in a violation of prohibitive discharge standards prescribed by or established under ยง 403.5;

(iii) The alternative limit will not result in a non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Pretreatment Standards; and

(iv) Compliance with the Standards (either by using the technologies upon which the Standards are based or by using other control alternatives) would result in either:

(A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or

(B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.
