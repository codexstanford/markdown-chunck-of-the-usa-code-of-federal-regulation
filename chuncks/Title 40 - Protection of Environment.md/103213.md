####### Total work.,e,w,w,[object Object]

(2)To calculate a value proportional to total work over a test interval, integrate a value that is proportional to power. Use information about the brake-specific fuel consumption of your engine,to convert a signal proportional to fuel flow rate to a signal proportional to power. To determine a signal proportional to fuel flow rate, divide a signal that is proportional to the mass rate of carbon products by the fraction of carbon in your fuel,You may use a measuredor you may use default values for a given fuel as described in ยง 1065.655(e). Calculate the mass rate of carbon from the amount of carbon and water in the exhaust, which you determine with a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust as described in ยง 1065.655. In the chemical balance, you must use concentrations from the flow that generated the signal proportional to molar flow rate,, in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Calculate a value proportional to total work as follows:
