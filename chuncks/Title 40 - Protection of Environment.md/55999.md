####### Performance of corrosion control studies.

(c)(1) Water systems without corrosion control treatment that are required to conduct corrosion control studies must complete the following:

(i) Any water system without corrosion control treatment must evaluate the effectiveness of each of the following treatments, and if appropriate, combinations of the following treatments to identify the optimal corrosion control treatment for the system:

(A) Alkalinity and pH adjustment;

(B) The addition of an orthophosphate- or silicate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an effective corrosion inhibitor residual concentration in all test samples;

(C) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 1 mg/L (as PO4) in all test samples; and

(D) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 3 mg/L (as PO) in all test samples.

(ii) The water system must evaluate each of the corrosion control treatments using either pipe rig/loop tests, metal coupon tests, partial-system tests, or analyses based on documented analogous treatments with other systems of similar size, water chemistry, and distribution system configurations. Large and medium systems and small community water systems and non-transient non-community water systems that select the corrosion control treatment option under ยง 141.93 with lead service lines that exceed the lead action level must conduct pipe rig/loop studies using harvested lead service lines from their distribution systems to assess the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment options on the existing pipe scale. For these systems, metal coupon tests can be used as a screen to reduce the number of options that are evaluated using pipe rig/loops to the current conditions and two options.

(iii) The water system must measure the following water quality parameters in any tests conducted under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii) before and after evaluating the corrosion control treatments listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(A) Lead;

(B) Copper;

(C) pH;

(D) Alkalinity;

(E) Orthophosphate as PO(when an orthophosphate-based inhibitor is used); and

(F) Silicate (when a silicate-based inhibitor is used).

(iv) The water system must identify all chemical or physical constraints that limit or prohibit the use of a particular corrosion control treatment and document such constraints with one of the following:

(A) Data and documentation showing that a particular corrosion control treatment has adversely affected other drinking water treatment processes when used by another water system with comparable water quality characteristics. Systems using coupon studies to screen and/or pipe loop/rig studies to evaluate treatment options must not exclude treatment strategies from the studies based on the constraints identified in this section.

(B) Data and documentation demonstrating that the water system has previously attempted to evaluate a particular corrosion control treatment and has found that the treatment is ineffective or adversely affects other drinking water quality treatment processes. Systems using coupon studies to screen and/or pipe loop/rig studies to evaluate treatment options must not exclude treatment strategies from the studies based on the constraints identified in this section unless the treatment was found to be ineffective in a previous pipe loop/rig study.

(v) The water system must evaluate the effect of the chemicals used for corrosion control treatment on other drinking water quality treatment processes. Systems using coupon studies to screen and/or pipe loop/rig studies to evaluate treatment options shall not exclude treatment strategies from the studies based on the effects identified in this section.
