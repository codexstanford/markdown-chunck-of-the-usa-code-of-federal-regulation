####### i.e.,

(1) Trailers with four or more axles and trailers less than 35 feet long with three axles (trailers intended for hauling very heavy loads).

(2) Trailers intended for temporary or permanent residence, office space, or other work space, such as campers, mobile homes, and carnival trailers.

(3) Trailers with a gap of at least 120 inches between adjacent axle centerlines. In the case of adjustable axle spacing, this refers to the closest possible axle positioning.

(4) Trailers built before January 1, 2018.

(5) Note that the definition of "trailer" in ยง 1037.801 excludes equipment that serves similar purposes but are not intended to be pulled by a tractor. This exclusion applies to such equipment whether or not they are known commercially as trailers. For example, any equipment pulled by a heavy-duty vehicle with a pintle hook or hitch instead of a fifth wheel does not qualify as a trailer under this part.

(i) Where it is unclear, you may ask us to make a determination regarding the exclusions identified in this section. We recommend that you make your request before you produce the vehicle.
