####### Add-on air pollution control device

means equipment installed at the end of a process vent exhaust stack or stacks that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air. The device may destroy or secure the pollutant for subsequent recovery. Examples are incinerators, condensers, carbon adsorbers, and biofiltration units. Transfer equipment and ductwork are not considered in and of themselves add-on air pollution control devices.
