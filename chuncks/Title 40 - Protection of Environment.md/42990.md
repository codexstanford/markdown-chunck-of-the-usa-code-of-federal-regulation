(B) A unit with an approved alternative emission limitation demonstration period shall install all NOemission control systems, make any operational modifications, and complete any upgrades and maintenance to equipment specified in the approved demonstration period plan for optimizing NOemission reduction performance.

(C) When the owner or operator identifies boiler or NOemission control system operating modifications that would produce higher NOemission reductions, enabling the affected unit to comply with, or bring its emission rate closer to, the applicable emission limitation under ยง 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7, the designated representative shall submit an administrative amendment under ยง 72.83 of this chapter to revise the unit's Acid Rain permit and demonstration period plan to include such modifications.
