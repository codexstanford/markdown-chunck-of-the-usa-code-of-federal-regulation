###### Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
####### § 63.4142 How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?

(a) For each compliance period, to demonstrate continuous compliance, you must use no coating for which the organic HAP content, determined according to § 63.4141(d), exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, and use no thinner or cleaning material that contains organic HAP, determined according to § 63.4141(a). Each month following the initial compliance period described in § 63.4140 is a compliance period.

(b) If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating, thinner, or cleaning material that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.4110(b)(6) and 63.4120(d).

(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.4120, you must submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because, during the compliance period, you used no thinners or cleaning materials that contained organic HAP, and you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090.

(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131.
