####### Flexible polyurethane foam

means a flexible cellular polymer containing urea and carbamate linkages in the chain backbone produced by reacting a diisocyanate, polyol, and water. Flexible polyurethane foams are open-celled, permit the passage of air through the foam, and possess the strength and flexibility to allow repeated distortion or compression under stress with essentially complete recovery upon removal of the stress.
