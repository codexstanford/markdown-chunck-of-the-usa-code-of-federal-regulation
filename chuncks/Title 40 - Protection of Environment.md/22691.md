8.3.3 Conduct the CD test using the zero gas specified and either the mid-level or high-level gas as specified in section 7.1. Sequentially introduce the reference gases to the CEMS at the sampling system of the CEMS immediately preceding the sample extraction filtration system. Record the CEMS response (A) for each reference gas and, using Equation 12A-2, subtract the corresponding reference value (R) from the CEMS value, and express the absolute value of the difference as a percentage of the span value (example data sheet in Figure 12A-2). For each reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value must not exceed 5 percent of the span value. If these specifications are not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding.

8.4 Relative Accuracy (RA) Test Procedure.

8.4.1 RA Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure given in sections 8.4.2 through 8.4.6 while the affected facility is operating normally, or as specified in an applicable subpart. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.
