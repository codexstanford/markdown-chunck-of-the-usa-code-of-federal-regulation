####### ยง 60.5535 How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?
######## e.g.,
######### Note:

(ii) The corresponding hourly gross or net energy output value is also valid data (For hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).

(2) You must exclude operating hours in which:

(i) The substitute data provisions of part 75 of this chapter are applied for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly COmass emissions or, if a heat input-based standard applies, for any parameters used to determine the hourly heat input; or

(ii) An exceedance of the full-scale range of a continuous emission monitoring system occurs for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly COmass emissions or, if applicable, to determine the hourly heat input; or

(iii) The total gross or net energy output (P) or, if applicable, the total heat input is unavailable.

(3) For each compliance period, at least 95 percent of the operating hours in the compliance period must be valid operating hours, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(4) You must calculate the total COmass emissions by summing the valid hourly COmass emissions values from ยง 60.5535 for all of the valid operating hours in the compliance period.
