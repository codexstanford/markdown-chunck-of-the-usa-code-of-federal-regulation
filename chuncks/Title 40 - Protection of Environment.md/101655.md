###### ยง 1048.240 How do I demonstrate that my engine family complies with exhaust emission standards?
####### Multiplicative deterioration factor.

(1)Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, use a multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. A multiplicative deterioration factor is the ratio of exhaust emissions at the end of useful life to exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. If the factor is less than one, use one.
