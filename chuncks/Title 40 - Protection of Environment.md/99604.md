Engines using SCR to control emissions depend on a constant supply of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). This section describes how manufacturers must design their engines to derate power output to induce operators to take appropriate actions to ensure the SCR system is working properly. The requirements of this section apply equally for engines installed in heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 lbs GVWR. The requirements of this section apply starting in model year 2027, though you may comply with the requirements of this section in earlier model years.
