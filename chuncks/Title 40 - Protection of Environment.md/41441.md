##### § 70.8 Permit review by EPA and affected States.
###### Transmission of information to the Administrator.

(a)(1) The permit program must require that the permitting authority provide to the Administrator a copy of each permit application (including any application for significant or minor permit modification), the statement required by § 70.7(a)(5) (sometimes referred to as the `statement of basis'), each proposed permit, each final permit, and, if significant comment is received during the public participation process, the written response to comments (which must include a written response to all significant comments raised during the public participation process on the draft permit and recorded under § 70.7(h)(5) of this part), and an explanation of how those public comments and the permitting authority's responses are available to the public. The applicant may be required by the permitting authority to provide a copy of the permit application (including the compliance plan) directly to the Administrator. Upon agreement with the Administrator, the permitting authority may submit to the Administrator a permit application summary form and any relevant portion of the permit application and compliance plan, in place of the complete permit application and compliance plan. To the extent practicable, the preceding information shall be provided in computer-readable format compatible with EPA's national database management system.

(i) Where the public participation process for a draft permit concludes before the proposed permit is submitted to the Administrator, the statement required by § 70.7(a)(5) (sometimes referred to as the `statement of basis') and the written response to comments, if significant comment was received during the public participation process, must be submitted with the proposed permit along with other supporting materials required in § 70.8(a)(1) of this part, excepting the final permit. The Administrator's 45-day review period for this proposed permit will not begin until such materials have been received by the EPA.

(ii) In instances where the Administrator has received a proposed permit from a permitting authority before the public participation process on the draft permit has been completed, the statement required by § 70.7(a)(5) (sometimes referred to as the `statement of basis') must be submitted with the proposed permit along with other supporting materials, required in § 70.8(a)(1) of this part, excepting the final permit and the written response to comments. If the permitting authority receives significant comment on the draft permit during the public participation process, but after the submission of the proposed permit to the Administrator, the Administrator will no longer consider the submitted proposed permit as a permit proposed to be issued under section 505 of the Act. In such instances, the permitting authority must make any revisions to the permit and permit record necessary to address such public comments, including preparation of a written response to comments (which must include a written response to all significant comments raised during the public participation process on the draft permit and recorded under § 70.7(h)(5) of this part), and must submit the proposed permit and the supporting material required under § 70.8(a)(1)(i) of this part, excepting the final permit, to the Administrator after the public comment period has closed. This later submitted permit will then be considered as a permit proposed to be issued under section 505 of the Act, and the Administrator's review period for the proposed permit will not begin until all required materials have been received by the EPA.

(2) The Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section for any category of sources (including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major sources according to the following:

(i) By regulation for a category of sources nationwide, or

(ii) At the time of approval of a State program for a category of sources covered by an individual permitting program.

(3) Each State permitting authority shall keep for 5 years such records and submit to the Administrator such information as the Administrator may reasonably require to ascertain whether the State program complies with the requirements of the Act or of this part.
