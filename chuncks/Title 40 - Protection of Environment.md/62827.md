####### Adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level.

(3)The energy average level for the measured car coupling sounds is calculated to determine the average maximum sound level (L). It is then adjusted by adding the adjustment (C) from Table 2 appropriate to the number of measurements divided by the duration of the measurement period (n/T), to obtain the adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level (L) for car coupling impacts.
