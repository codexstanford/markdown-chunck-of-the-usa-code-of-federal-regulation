#### PART 93 - DETERMINING CONFORMITY OF FEDERAL ACTIONS TO STATE OR FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
##### Subpart A - Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws
###### ยง 93.122 Procedures for determining regional transportation-related emissions.
####### Reliance on previous regional emissions analysis.
######## PM,PM,hot-spot analyses.

(b)and(1) The hot-spot demonstration required by ยง 93.116 must be based on quantitative analysis methods for the following types of projects:

(i) New highway projects that have a significant number of diesel vehicles, and expanded highway projects that have a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles;

(ii) Projects affecting intersections that are at Level-of-Service D, E, or F with a significant number of diesel vehicles, or those that will change to Level-of-Service D, E, or F because of increased traffic volumes from a significant number of diesel vehicles related to the project;

(iii) New bus and rail terminals and transfer points that have a significant number of diesel vehicles congregating at a single location;

(iv) Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points that significantly increase the number of diesel vehicles congregating at a single location; and

(v) Projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites which are identified in the PMor PMapplicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission, as appropriate, as sites of violation or possible violation.

(2) Where quantitative analysis methods are not available, the demonstration required by ยง 93.116 for projects described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be based on a qualitative consideration of local factors.

(3) DOT, in consultation with EPA, may also choose to make a categorical hot-spot finding that ยง 93.116 is met without further hot-spot analysis for any project described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section based on appropriate modeling. DOT, in consultation with EPA, may also consider the current air quality circumstances of a given PMor PMnonattainment or maintenance area in categorical hot-spot findings for applicable FHWA or FTA projects.

(4) The requirements for quantitative analysis contained in this paragraph (b) will not take effect until EPA releases modeling guidance on this subject and announces in thethat these requirements are in effect.
