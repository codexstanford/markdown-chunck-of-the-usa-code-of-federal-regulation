These parameters shall be monitored during each subsequent operating hour. If any of these parameters are not within the acceptable range in a given operating hour, the fuel and unit specific NOemission rates may not be used in that hour, and the appropriate default NOemission rate from Table LM-2 shall be reported instead.

(I) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the appendix E testing to determine (or re-determine) the fuel-specific, unit-specific NOemission rate for a unit (or for each unit in a group of identical units) may be performed at fewer than four loads, under the following circumstances:
