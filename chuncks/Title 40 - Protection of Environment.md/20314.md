######## i.e.,

(2) If you cease combusting solid waste, you may opt to remain subject to the provisions of this subpart. Consistent with the definition of CISWI, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart at least 6 months following the last date of solid waste combustion. Solid waste combustion is ceased when solid waste is not in the combustion chamber (the solid waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the solid waste residence time);

(3) If you cease combusting solid waste, you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch is a date selected by you, that must be at least 6 months from the date that you ceased combusting solid waste, consistent with ยง 60.2145(a)(2). Your source must remain in compliance with this subpart until the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch;

(4) If you own or operate an existing commercial or industrial combustion unit that combusted a fuel or non-waste material, and you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste, you are subject to the provisions of this subpart as of the first day you introduce or reintroduce solid waste to the combustion chamber, and this date constitutes the effective date of the fuel-to-waste switch. You must complete all initial compliance demonstrations for any section 112 standards that are applicable to your facility before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste. You must provide 30 days prior notice of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The notification must identify:

(i) The name of the owner or operator of the CISWI, the location of the source, the emissions unit(s) that will cease burning solid waste, and the date of the notice;

(ii) The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and any 40 CFR part 63 subpart and subcategory that will be applicable after you cease combusting solid waste;

(iii) The fuel(s), non-waste material(s) and solid waste(s) the CISWI is currently combusting and has combusted over the past 6 months, and the fuel(s) or non-waste materials the unit will commence combusting;

(iv) The date on which you became subject to the currently applicable emission limits; and
