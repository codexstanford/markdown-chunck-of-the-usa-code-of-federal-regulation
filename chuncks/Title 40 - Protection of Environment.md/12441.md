() If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that meets USEPA specifications, and which directs all VOM to a control device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (B). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a structure is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this section. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 percent and the source is still required to measure control efficiency using appropriate test methods as specified in (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
