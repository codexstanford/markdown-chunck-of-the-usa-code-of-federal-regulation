###### ยง 1068.10 Practices for handling confidential business information.
####### Preliminary and superseded information.

(2)Preliminary and superseded versions of information you submit are covered by confidentiality determinations in the same manner as final documents. However, we will generally not disclose preliminary or superseded information unless we receive a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 that specifically asks for all versions of a document, including preliminary and superseded versions. We will consider a document preliminary if we have not reviewed it to verify its accuracy or if the reporting deadline has not yet passed. We will consider information superseded if you submit a new document or a revised application for certification to replace the earlier version.
