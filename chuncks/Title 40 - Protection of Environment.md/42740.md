###### ยง 75.59 Certification, quality assurance, and quality control record provisions.
####### i.e.

(iv) Reference value (, calibration gas concentration or reference signal value, in ppm or other appropriate units);

(v) Observed value (monitor response during calibration, in ppm or other appropriate units);

(vi) Percent calibration error (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) (flag if using alternative performance specification for low emitters or differential pressure flow monitors);

(vii) Reference signal or calibration gas level;

(viii) For 7-day calibration error tests, a test number and reason for test;

(ix) For 7-day calibration tests for certification or recertification, a certification from the cylinder gas vendor or CEMS vendor that calibration gas, as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter and appendix A to this part, was used to conduct calibration error testing;

(x) Description of any adjustments, corrective actions, or maintenance prior to a passed test or following a failed test; and

(xi) Indication of whether the unit is off-line or on-line.

(2) For each flow monitor, the owner or operator shall record the following for all daily interference checks, including any follow-up tests after corrective action.

(i) Component-system identification code (after January 1, 2009, only the component identification code is required);

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Code indicating whether monitor passes or fails the interference check; and

(iv) Description of any adjustments, corrective actions, or maintenance prior to a passed test or following a failed test.

(3) For each SOor NOpollutant concentration monitor, COemissions concentration monitor (including Omonitors used to determine COemissions), or diluent gas monitor (including wet- and dry-basis Omonitors used to determine percent moisture), the owner or operator shall record the following for the initial and all subsequent linearity check(s), including any follow-up tests after corrective action.

(i) Component-system identification code (on and after January 1, 2009, only the component identification code is required);

(ii) Instrument span and span scale (only span scale is required on and after January 1, 2009);

(iii) Calibration gas level;

(iv) Date and time (hour and minute) of each gas injection at each calibration gas level;
