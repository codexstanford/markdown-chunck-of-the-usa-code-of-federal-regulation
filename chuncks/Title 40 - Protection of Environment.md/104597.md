####### Segregation requirement.

(e)A transmix processor or distributor must segregate 500 ppm LM diesel fuel from other fuels except as follows:

(1) A pipeline operator may ship 500 ppm LM diesel fuel by pipeline provided that the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel does not come into physical contact in the pipeline with distillate fuels that have a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm. If 500 ppm LM diesel fuel is shipped by pipeline adjacent to ULSD, the pipeline operator must cut ULSD into the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.

(2) A WPC or retailer of 500 ppm LM diesel fuel may introduce ULSD into a storage tank that contains 500 ppm LM diesel fuel, provided that the other requirements of this section are satisfied. The resultant mixture must be designated as 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.
