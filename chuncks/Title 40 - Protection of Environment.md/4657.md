####### Collocated monitors

refers to two or more air measurement instruments for the same parameter (e.g., PMmass) operated at the same site location, and whose placement is consistent with ยง 53.1 of this chapter. For purposes of considering a combined site record in this appendix, when two or more monitors are operated at the same site, one monitor is designated as the "primary" monitor with any additional monitors designated as "collocated." It is implicit in these appendix procedures that the primary monitor and collocated monitor(s) are all deemed suitable for the applicable NAAQS comparison; however, it is not a requirement that the primary and monitors utilize the same specific sampling and analysis method.
