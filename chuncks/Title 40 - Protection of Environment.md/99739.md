###### ยง 1036.514 Low Load Cycle.

(a) Measure emissions using the transient Low Load Cycle (LLC) as described in this section to determine whether engines meet the LLC emission standards in ยง 1036.104.

(b) The LLC duty cycle is described in paragraph (d) of appendix B of this part. The following procedures apply differently for testing engines and hybrid powertrains:

(1) For nonhybrid engine testing, the duty cycle is based on normalized speed and torque values.

(i) Denormalize speed as described in 40 CFR 1065.512. Denormalize torque as described in 40 CFR 1065.610(d).

(ii) For idle segments more than 200 seconds, set reference torques to the torque needed to meet the accessory loads in Table 1 of this section instead of CITT. This is to represent shifting the transmission to park or neutral at the start of the idle segment. Change the reference torque to CITT no earlier than 5 seconds before the end of the idle segment. This is to represent shifting the transmission to drive.

(2) Test hybrid engines and hybrid powertrains as described in ยง 1036.510(b)(2), with the following exceptions:
