###### Particulate potential to release.

6.1.2.2Evaluate particulate potential to release for those sources that contain particulate hazardous substances-that is, those hazardous substances with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 10torr.

Evaluate particulate potential to release for each source based on three factors: particulate containment, particulate source type, and particulate migration potential. Calculate the particulate potential to release value as illustrated in table 6-8. Combine sources with similar characteristics into a single source in evaluating the particulate potential to release factors.
