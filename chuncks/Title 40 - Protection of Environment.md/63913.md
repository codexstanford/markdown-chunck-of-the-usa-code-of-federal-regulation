() Disposal vessels shall use an appropriate navigation system capable of indicating the position of the vessel carrying dredged material (for example, a hopper dredged vessel or towed barge) with a minimum accuracy and precision of 100 feet during all disposal operations. The system must also indicate the opening and closing of the doors of the vessel carrying the dredged material. If the positioning system fails, all disposal operations must cease until the navigational capabilities are restored. The back-up navigation system, with all the capabilities listed in this condition, must be in place on the vessel carrying the dredged material.
