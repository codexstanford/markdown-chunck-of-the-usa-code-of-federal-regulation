###### ยง 63.43 Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for constructed and reconstructed major sources.
####### Application requirements for a case-by-case MACT determination.

(e)(1) An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other document specified by the permitting authority under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) In each instance where a constructed or reconstructed major source would require additional control technology or a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:

(i) The name and address (physical location) of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed;

(ii) A brief description of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed and identification of any listed source category or categories in which it is included;

(iii) The expected commencement date for the construction or reconstruction of the major source;

(iv) The expected completion date for construction or reconstruction of the major source;

(v) the anticipated date of start-up for the constructed or reconstructed major source;

(vi) The HAP emitted by the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the estimated emission rate for each such HAP, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;

(vii) Any federally enforceable emission limitations applicable to the constructed or reconstructed major source;

(viii) The maximum and expected utilization of capacity of the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the associated uncontrolled emission rates for that source, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;

(ix) The controlled emissions for the constructed or reconstructed major source in tons/yr at expected and maximum utilization of capacity, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;

(x) A recommended emission limitation for the constructed or reconstructed major source consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section;

(xi) The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency of the control technology (and the manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and relevant specifications and drawings, if requested by the permitting authority);

(xii) Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements for the selected control technology; and

(xiii) Any other relevant information required pursuant to subpart A.

(3) In each instance where the owner or operator contends that a constructed or reconstructed major source will be in compliance, upon startup, with case-by-case MACT under this subpart without a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:

(i) The information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(x) of this section; and

(ii) Documentation of the control technology in place.
