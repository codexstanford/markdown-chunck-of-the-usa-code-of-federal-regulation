###### General.

Use Schedule C.3 to report the end-of-period asset investments and current liabilities for the most recent fiscal year: (a) expressed in nominal dollars as of the date of the original transaction, and (b) expressed in the current year's dollars, i.e. 1984 dollars. The value of net investment in constant dollars (1984 dollars for smelters applying for an NSO in 1984) is used in Schedule C.4 as the benchmark of the Rate of Return Test.

Applicants should complete Schedule C.3 according to the following instructions. Transfer into the first column of Schedule C.3 the historical cost figures that are reported in the last (1983) column of Table A.4. In the second column of Schedule C.3, report the figures from the first column of Schedule C.3, expressed in constant (1984) dollars.

Convert each nominal dollar figure of the first column into constant (1984) dollars in accordance with the historical cost/constant dollar accounting method defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 33 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6d), with the following exception: the applicant must not report the lower recoverable amount as required by FASB No. 33. Attach explanatory supporting schedules as part of Exhibit B.
