####### Compliance determining method.

(ii)(A) Compliance with the emission limit in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. In the event that a single monitoring location cannot be used for both the north and south main flare, ConocoPhillips shall monitor the flow and measure the total sulfur concentration at more than one location in order to determine compliance with the main flare emission limit. ConocoPhillips shall log and report any instances when emissions are vented from the north main flare and south main flare simultaneously.

(B) Compliance with the emission limits and requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section shall be determined by summing the emissions from the Jupiter Sulfur SRU flare and SRU/ATS stack. Emissions from the Jupiter Sulfur SRU flare shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section and the emissions from the Jupiter Sulfur SRU/ATS stack shall be determined pursuant to ConocoPhillips' 1998 exhibit (see section 4(A) of the exhibit).
