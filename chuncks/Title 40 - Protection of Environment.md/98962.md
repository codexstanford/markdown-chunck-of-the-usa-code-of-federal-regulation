####### Dose selection.

(2)(i) A single dose is required for each route of exposure. The dose should be nontoxic, but high enough to allow for metabolite identification in excreta. If no other toxicity data are available for selection of the low dose, a dose identified as a fraction of the LD(as determined from acute toxicity studies) may be used. The magnitude of the dose used in Tier 1 studies should be justified in the final report.

(ii) For test substances of low toxicity a maximum dose of 1,000 mg/kg should be used; chemical-specific considerations may necessitate a higher maximum dose and will be addressed in specific test rules.
