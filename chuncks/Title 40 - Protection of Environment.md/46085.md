####### Fuel system injection timing.

(C)The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel injection system when the system is unable to deliver fuel at the proper crank angle/timing (e.g., injection timing too advanced or too retarded) necessary to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel injection timing could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the commanded fuel injection timing cannot be achieved. For model year 2010 to 2012 engines with a unit injector fuel system, this requirement may be met by conducting a functional check of the fuel system injection timing in lieu of monitoring for conditions that could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds.
