######## Heat load calculation and tuning for systems that have regeneration events.

(e)Perform this procedure after the preliminary cycles are completed for both normal and regeneration operation. The target cumulative deactivation is determined from the input field data, and then a similar calculation is performed for the preliminary aging cycle. If the cumulative deactivation for the preliminary cycle does not match cumulative deactivation from the field data, then the cycle is tuned over a series of steps until the target is matched.

(1) The deactivation for a given catalyst is calculated for each time step as follows:
