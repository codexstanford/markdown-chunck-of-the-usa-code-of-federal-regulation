####### Test parameters.

(3)Environmental parameters of the water contained in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:

(i) The test temperature shall be 20 &#xB0;C. Excursions from the test temperature shall be no greater than +/-2 &#xB0;C.

(ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done before the addition of the test chemical. All treatment and control chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.

(iii) The number of daphnids placed in a test chamber shall not affect test results. Loading shall not exceed 40 daphnids per liter test solution in the static system. In the flow-through test, loading limits will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. Loading shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below the recommended levels.

(iv) Photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours darkness.
