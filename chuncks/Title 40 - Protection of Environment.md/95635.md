####### Definitions.

(2)(i) "Adaptation" is the process by which a substance induces the synthesis of any degradative enzymes necessary to catalyze the transformation of that substance.

(ii) "Ultimate Biodegradability" is the breakdown of an organic compound to CO, water, the oxides or mineral salts of other elements and/or to products associated with normal metabolic processes of microorganisms.

(iii) "Ready Biodegradability" is an expression used to describe those substances which, in certain biodegradation test procedures, produce positive results that are unequivocal and which lead to the reasonable assumption that the substance will undergo rapid and ultimate biodegradation in aerobic aquatic environments.
