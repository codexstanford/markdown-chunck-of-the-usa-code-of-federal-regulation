######## Sulfur exposure.

(3)The total sulfur exposure is the sum of fuel- and oil-related sulfur. Oil-related sulfur will be accounted for in the acceleration of oil exposure directly. We recommend that you determine fuel-related sulfur exposure by selecting an application that represents the 90th percentile of fuel consumption. Use good engineering judgment to determine that average rate of fuel consumption for the target application. You may use a combination of field and laboratory measurements to make this determination. Calculate the average rate of fuel-related sulfur exposure in grams per hour from the average rate of fuel consumption assuming a fuel sulfur level of 10 ppm by weight.
