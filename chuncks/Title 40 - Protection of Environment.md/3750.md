####### § 49.4176 VOC emissions control requirements for covers and closed-vent systems.
######## Closed-vent systems.

(d)Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for closed-vent systems:

(1) Each closed-vent system must route all captured storage vessel emissions from flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; and pneumatic pump emissions from the oil and natural gas source to a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or to a VOC emission control device, as specified in §§ 49.4173 through 49.4175.

(2) All vent lines, connections, fittings, valves, relief valves, and any other appurtenances employed to collect or contain captured storage vessel emissions from flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; or pneumatic pump emissions; or to transport such emissions to a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or to a VOC emission control device, as specified in §§ 49.4173 through 49.4175, must be maintained and operated properly at all times.

(3) Each closed-vent system must be designed to operate with no detectable emissions, as demonstrated by the closed-vent system monitoring requirements in § 49.4182(c).

(4) If any closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices that could be used to divert all or a portion of the captured storage vessel flashing, working, standing, and breathing losses; glycol dehydration unit process vent emissions; or pneumatic pump emissions from entering a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or from being transferred to the VOC emissions control device, the owner or operator must meet one of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section for each bypass device. Low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and safety devices are not subject to the requirements applicable to bypass devices.

(i) At the inlet to a bypass device the owner or operator must properly install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that is capable of taking continuous readings and sounding an alarm when the bypass device is open such that emissions are being, or could be, diverted away from a gathering pipeline system for sale, use in a process unit, incorporation into a product, or other beneficial purpose, or the VOC emission control device and into the atmosphere; or

(ii) The owner or operator must secure the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass device in the non-diverting position using a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration.
