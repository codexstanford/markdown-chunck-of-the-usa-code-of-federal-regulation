###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Method for calculating volumetric GHG emissions from as found measurements of manifolded groups of centrifugal compressor sources.

(8)For manifolded groups of compressor sources measured according to paragraph (o)(1)(iii) of this section, you must calculate annual volumetric GHG emissions using Equation W-24B of this section. If the centrifugal compressors included in the manifolded group of compressor sources share the manifold with reciprocating compressors, you must follow the procedures in either this paragraph (o)(8) or paragraph (p)(8) of this section to calculate emissions from the manifolded group of compressor sources.
