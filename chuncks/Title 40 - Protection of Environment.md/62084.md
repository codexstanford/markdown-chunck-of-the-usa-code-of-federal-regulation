(2) Tolerances are established for residues of afidopyropen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph (a)(2) is to be determined by measuring only the sum of afidopyropen, [(344a66a1212a12b)-3-[(cyclopropylcarbonyl)oxy]-1,3,4,4a,5,6a,12,12a,12b-decahydro-6,12-dihydroxy-4,6a,12b-trimethyl-11-oxo-9-(3-pyridinyl)211-naphtho[2,1-]pyrano[3,4-]pyran-4-yl]methyl cyclopropanecarboxylate and its metabolite cyclopropanecarboxylic acid carnitine (CPCA-carnitine), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of afidopyropen in or on the following animal commodities:
