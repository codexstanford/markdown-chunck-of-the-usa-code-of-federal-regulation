####### ยง 63.4568 What are the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system installation, operation, and maintenance?
######## Regenerative carbon adsorbers.,e.g.,

(d)If you are using a regenerative carbon adsorber as an add-on control device, you must monitor the total regeneration desorbing gas (steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and cooling cycle, and comply with paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) and (d)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) The regeneration desorbing gas mass flow monitor must be an integrating device having a measurement sensitivity of plus or minus 10 percent capable of recording the total regeneration desorbing gas mass flow for each regeneration cycle.

(2) The carbon bed temperature monitor must be capable of recording the temperature within 15 minutes of completing any carbon bed cooling cycle.

(3) For all regenerative carbon adsorbers, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for each temperature monitoring device.
