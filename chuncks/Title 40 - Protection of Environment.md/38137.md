######## Emissions testing.

(i)If you use manual emissions testing to demonstrate compliance for one or more EGUs in your emissions averaging group, you must use the results from the most recent performance test to determine the 30 (or 90) day rolling average. You may use CEMS or sorbent trap data in combination with data from the most recent manual performance test in calculating the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating day rolling average emissions rate.
