######## Curing oven

means a thermal process unit that operates at a peak temperature typically between 90&#xB0; and 340 &#xB0;C (200&#xB0; and 650 &#xB0;F) and is used to activate a thermosetting resin, pitch, or other binder in refractory shapes. Curing ovens also perform the same function as shape dryers in removing the free moisture from refractory shapes.
