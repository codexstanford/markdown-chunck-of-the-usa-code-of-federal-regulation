g. All changes to themust follow rulemaking requirements since theis codified in appendix W to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51. The EPA will promulgate proposed and final rules in theto amend this appendix. The EPA utilizes the existing procedures under CAA section 320 that requires the EPA to conduct a Conference on Air Quality Modeling at least every 3 years (CAA 320, 42 U.S.C. 7620). These modeling conferences are intended to develop standardized air quality modeling procedures and form the basis for associated revisions to thisin support of the EPA's continuing effort to prescribe with "reasonable particularity" air quality models and meteorological and emission databases suitable for modeling National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)and PSD increments. Ample opportunity for public comment will be provided for each proposed change and public hearings scheduled.
