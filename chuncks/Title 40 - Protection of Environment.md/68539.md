####### Unauthorized State Amendments.

(4)(i) Oklahoma has adopted, but is not authorized to implement, the Federal rules that are listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(4)(i). The EPA will continue to implement the Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) requirements for which Oklahoma is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements. The EPA will not enforce the non-HSWA Federal rules although they may be enforceable under State law. For those Federal rules that contain both HSWA and non-HSWA requirements, the EPA will enforce only the HSWA portions of the rules.

(ii) The Federal rules listed in the table in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) are not delegable to States. Oklahoma has excluded the rules from its incorporation by reference of the Federal regulations. EPA retains its authority for the implementation and enforcement of these rules.
