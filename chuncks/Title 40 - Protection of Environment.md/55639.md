If a public water system applies disinfectants at more than one point prior to the first customer, it must determine the CT of each disinfectant sequence before or at the first customer to determine the total percent inactivation or "total inactivation ratio." In determining the total inactivation ratio, the public water system must determine the residual disinfectant concentration of each disinfection sequence and corresponding contact time before any subsequent disinfection application point(s). "CT" is the CT value required for 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation ofcysts. CTfor a variety of disinfectants and conditions appear in tables 1.1-1.6, 2.1, and 3.1 of ยง 141.74(b)(3).
