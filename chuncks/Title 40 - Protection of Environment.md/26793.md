####### Submittal dates.

(i)The Precompliance Report shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than December 19, 2000. If a Precompliance Report was submitted prior to June 19, 2000 and no changes need to be made to that Precompliance Report, the owner or operator shall re-submit the earlier report or submit notification that the previously submitted report is still valid. Unless the Administrator objects to a request submitted in the Precompliance Report within 45 days after its receipt, the request shall be deemed approved. For new affected sources, the Precompliance Report shall be submitted to the Administrator with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Supplements to the Precompliance Report may be submitted as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ix) of this section.

(ii) A request for an extension for compliance, as specified in § 63.481(e), may be submitted in the Precompliance Report. The request for a compliance extension shall include the data outlined in § 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D), as required in § 63.481(e)(1).

(iii) The alternative monitoring parameter information required in paragraph (f) of this section shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report if, for any emission point, the owner or operator of an affected source seeks to comply through the use of a control technique other than those for which monitoring parameters are specified in this subpart or in subpart G of this part, or seeks to comply by monitoring a different parameter than those specified in this subpart or in subpart G of this part.

(iv) If the affected source seeks to comply using alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit a request for approval in the Precompliance Report.

(v) The owner or operator shall report the intent to use alternative controls to comply with the provisions of this subpart in the Precompliance Report. The Administrator may deem alternative controls to be equivalent to the controls required by the standard, under the procedures outlined in § 63.6(g).

(vi) If a request for approval to use engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, as described in § 63.488(b)(6)(i)(C) is being made, the information required by § 63.488(b)(6)(iii)(B) shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report.

(vii) If an owner or operator establishes parameter monitoring levels according to the procedures contained in § 63.505(c) or (d), the following information shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report:

(A) Identification of which procedures (i.e., § 63.505(c) or (d)) are to be used; and
