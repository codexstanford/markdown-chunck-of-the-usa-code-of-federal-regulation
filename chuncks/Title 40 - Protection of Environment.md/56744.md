(a) Has adopted drinking water regulations which are no less stringent than the national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) in effect under part 141 of this chapter;

(b) Has adopted and is implementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of such State regulations, such procedures to include:

(1) Maintenance of an inventory of public water systems.

(2) A systematic program for conducting sanitary surveys of public water systems in the State, with priority given to sanitary surveys of public water systems not in compliance with State primary drinking water regulations.

(3)(i) The establishment and maintenance of a State program for the certification of laboratories conducting analytical measurements of drinking water contaminants pursuant to the requirements of the State primary drinking water regulations including the designation by the State of a laboratory officer, or officers, certified by the Administrator, as the official(s) responsible for the State's certification program. The requirements of this paragraph may be waived by the Administrator for any State where all analytical measurements required by the State's primary drinking water regulations are conducted at laboratories operated by the State and certified by the Agency. Until such time as the Agency establishes a National quality assurance program for laboratory certification the State shall maintain an interim program for the purpose of approving those laboratories from which the required analytical measurements will be acceptable.

(4) Assurance of the availability to the State of laboratory facilities certified by the Administrator and capable of performing analytical measurements of all contaminants specified in the State primary drinking water regulations. Until such time as the Agency establishes a National quality assurance program for laboratory certification the Administrator will approve such State laboratories on an interim basis.

(5) The establishment and maintenance of an activity to assure that the design and construction of new or substantially modified public water system facilities will be capable of compliance with the State primary drinking water regulations.
