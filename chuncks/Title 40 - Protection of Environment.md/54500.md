####### Stressed waters.

(f)An applicant must demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section not only on the basis of the applicant's own modified discharge, but also taking into account the applicant's modified discharge in combination with pollutants from other sources. However, if an applicant which discharges into ocean waters believes that its failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section is entirely attributable to conditions resulting from human perturbations other than its modified discharge (including, without limitation, other municipal or industrial discharges, nonpoint source runoff, and the applicant's previous discharges), the applicant need not demonstrate compliance with those requirements if it demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that its modified discharge does not or will not:

(1) Contribute to, increase, or perpetuate such stressed conditions;

(2) Contribute to further degradation of the biota or water quality if the level of human perturbation from other sources increases; and

(3) Retard the recovery of the biota or water quality if the level of human perturbation from other sources decreases.
