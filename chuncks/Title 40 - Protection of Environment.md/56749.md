####### Contents of a State request for approval of a program revision.

(c)(1) The State request for EPA approval of a program revision shall be concise and must include:

(i) The documentation necessary (pursuant to § 142.11(a)) to update the approved State primacy program, and identification of those elements of the approved State primacy program that have not changed because of the program revision. The documentation shall include a side-by-side comparison of the Federal requirements and the corresponding State authorities, including citations to the specific statutes and administrative regulations or ordinances and, wherever appropriate, judicial decisions which demonstrate adequate authority to meet the requirements of § 142.10 as they apply to the program revision.

(ii) Any additional materials that are listed in § 142.16 of this part for a specific EPA regulation, as appropriate; and

(iii) For a complete and final State request only, unless one of the conditions listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met, a statement by the State Attorney General (or the attorney for the State primacy agency if it has independent legal counsel) or the attorney representing the Indian tribe that certifies that the laws and regulations adopted by the State or tribal ordinances to carry out the program revision were duly adopted and are enforceable. State statutes and regulations cited by the State Attorney General and tribal ordinances cited by the attorney for the Indian tribe shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State statutes and regulations or tribal ordinances at the time the certification is made and shall be fully effective by the time the request for program revision is approved by EPA. To qualify as "independent legal counsel," the attorney signing the statement required by this section shall have full authority to independently represent the State primacy agency or tribe in court on all matters pertaining to the State or tribal program.

(2) An Attorney General's statement will be required as part of the State request for EPA approval of a program revision unless EPA specifically waives this requirement for a specific regulation at the time EPA promulgates the regulation, or by later written notice from the Administrator to the State.

(3) After EPA has received the documents required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, EPA may selectively require supplemental statements by the State Attorney General (or the attorney for the State primacy agency if it has independent legal counsel) or the attorney representing the Indian tribe. Each supplemental statement shall address all issues concerning the adequacy of State authorities to meet the requirements of § 142.10 that have been identified by EPA after thorough examination as unresolved by the documents submitted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
