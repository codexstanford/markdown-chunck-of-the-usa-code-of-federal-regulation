#### PART 20 - CERTIFICATION OF FACILITIES
##### Appendix A to Part 20 - Guidelines for Certification
###### State certification.

6.To qualify for rapid amortization under section 169, a facility must first be certified by the State as having been installed "in conformity with the State program or requirements for abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution or contamination." Significantly, the statute does not say that the State must require that a facility be installed. If use of a facility will not actually contravene a State requirement, the State may certify. However, since State certification is a prerequisite to EPA certification, EPA may not certify if the State has denied certification for whatever reason.

It should be noted that certification of a facility does not constitute the personal warranty of the certifying official that the conditions of the statute have been met. EPA certification is binding on the Government only to the extent the submitted facts are accurate and complete.
