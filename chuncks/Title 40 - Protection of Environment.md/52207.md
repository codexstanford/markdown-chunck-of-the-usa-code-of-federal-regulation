(k) For fluorinated GHGs whose GWPs are not listed in Table A-1 to subpart A of this part, maintain records of the GWPs used to calculate facility-wide COe emissions under ยง 98.127(j). Where you used your best estimate of the GWP, maintain records of the data and analysis used to develop that GWP, including the data elements at ยง 98.123(c)(1)(vi)(A)()through (). If you have used QSARs to estimate the GWP, include information documenting the level of accuracy of the QSAR-derived GWP, including information on how the structure of the "target" fluorinated GHG is similar to the structures of the fluorinated GHGs used to model the radiative forcing and/or reaction rate of the "target" fluorinated GHG, the quality and quantity of the measurements of the radiative forcings and/or reaction rates of the fluorinated GHGs used to model these parameters for the "target" fluorinated GHG, any estimated uncertainties of the modeled forcings and/or reaction rates, and descriptions and results of any efforts to validate the QSAR model(s).
