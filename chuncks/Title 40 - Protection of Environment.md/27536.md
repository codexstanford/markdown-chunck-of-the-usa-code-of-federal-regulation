####### Individual drain system

means a stationary system used to convey wastewater streams or residuals to a waste management unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying wastewater streams or residuals. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual drain systems.
