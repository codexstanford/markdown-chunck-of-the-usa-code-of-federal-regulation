####### Wind.

(d)If you test outdoors, use good engineering judgment to ensure that excessive wind does not affect your emission measurements. Winds are excessive if they disturb the size, shape, or location of the exhaust plume in the region where exhaust samples are drawn or where the smoke plume is measured, or otherwise cause any dilution of the exhaust. Tests may be conducted if wind shielding is placed adjacent to the exhaust plume to prevent bending, dispersion, or any other distortion of the exhaust plume as it passes through the optical unit or through the sample probe.
