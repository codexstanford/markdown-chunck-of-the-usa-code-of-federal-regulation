######## Dewpoint.

(e)For PM-stabilization environments, we recommend chilled-surface hygrometers, which include chilled mirror detectors and chilled surface acoustic wave (SAW) detectors. For other applications, we recommend thin-film capacitance sensors. You may use other dewpoint sensors, such as a wet-bulb/dry-bulb psychrometer, where appropriate.
