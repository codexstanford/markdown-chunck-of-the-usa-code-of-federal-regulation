##### § 50.17 National primary ambient air quality standards for sulfur oxides (sulfur dioxide).
########### § 50.18 National primary ambient air quality standards for PM.

(a) The national primary ambient air quality standards for PMare 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m) annual arithmetic mean concentration and 35 µg/m24-hour average concentration measured in the ambient air as PM(particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) by either:

(1) A reference method based on appendix L to this part and designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; or

(2) An equivalent method designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.

(b) The primary annual PMstandard is met when the annual arithmetic mean concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N of this part, is less than or equal to 12.0 µg/m.

(c) The primary 24-hour PMstandard is met when the 98th percentile 24-hour concentration, as determined in accordance with appendix N of this part, is less than or equal to 35 µg/m.
