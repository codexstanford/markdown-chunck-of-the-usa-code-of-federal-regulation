####### SEAs, defect reporting, and recall.

(d)The provisions of 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E (i.e., SEA provisions) do not apply for locomotives. Except as noted in this paragraph (d), the provisions of 40 CFR part 1068, subpart F, apply to certificate holders for locomotives as specified for manufacturers in that part.

(1) When there are multiple persons meeting the definition of manufacturer or remanufacturer, each person meeting the definition of manufacturer or remanufacturer must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 1068, subpart F, as needed so that the certificate holder can fulfill its obligations under those subparts.

(2) The defect investigation requirements of 40 CFR 1068.501(a)(5), (b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply for locomotives. Instead, use good engineering judgment to investigate emission-related defects consistent with normal locomotive industry practice for investigating defects. You are not required to track parts shipments as indicators of possible defects.
