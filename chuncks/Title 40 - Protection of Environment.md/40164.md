###### Spectral De-resolution.

11.1Reference spectra can be converted to lower resolution standard spectra (section 3.3 of this method) by truncating the original reference sample and background interferograms. Appendix K of the FTIR Protocol gives specific deresolution procedures. Deresolved spectra shall be transformed using the same apodization function and level of zero filling as the sample spectra. Additionally, pre-test FTIR protocol calculations (e.g., FRU, MAU, FCU) shall be performed using the de-resolved standard spectra.
