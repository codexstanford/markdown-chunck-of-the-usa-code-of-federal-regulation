####### ยง 63.3360 What performance tests must I conduct?
######## Control Destruction Efficiency Curve Development.

(4)If you are using one or more add-on control devices other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance to comply with the emission standards in ยง 63.3320, you may establish a control destruction efficiency curve for use in estimating emissions that occur during deviations of the 3-hour operating parameters. This curve can be generated using test data or manufacturer's data that specifically documents the level of control at varying temperatures for your control device.
