###### Proximity to Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments at Facilities With a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons.

2.3A facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 million gallons must submit its response plan if it is located at a distance such that a discharge from the facility could cause injury (as defined at 40 CFR 112.2) to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's "Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments" (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability) and the applicable Area Contingency Plan. Facility owners or operators must determine the distance at which an oil discharge could cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments using the appropriate formula presented in Attachment C-III to this appendix or a comparable formula.
