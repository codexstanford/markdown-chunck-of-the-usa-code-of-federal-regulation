####### General.,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide hexazinone, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of hexazinone, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, and its plant metabolites: metabolite A, 3-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, metabolite B, 3-cyclohexyl-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, metabolite C, 3-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-(1, 3)-dione, metabolite D, 3-cyclohexyl-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1, 3, 5)-trione, and metabolite E, 3-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1, 3, 5)-trione, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of hexazinone, in or on the commodity.
