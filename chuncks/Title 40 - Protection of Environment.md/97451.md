######## Presaturation of the solvents.,n

(iii)Before a P is determined, the phases of the solvent system are mutually saturated by shaking at the temperature of the experiment. For doing this, it is practical to shake two large stock bottles of purified-octanol or distilled water each with a sufficient quantity of the other solvent for 24 hours on a mechanical shaker, and then to let them stand long enough to allow the phases to separate and to achieve a saturation state.
