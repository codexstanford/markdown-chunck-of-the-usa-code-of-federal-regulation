###### ยง 1054.801 What definitions apply to this part?
####### New nonroad equipment

means either of the following things:

(1) A nonroad piece of equipment for which the ultimate purchaser has never received the equitable or legal title. The product is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives this title or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.

(2) A nonroad piece of equipment with an engine that becomes new while installed in the equipment. For example, a complete piece of equipment that was imported without being covered by a certificate of conformity would be new nonroad equipment because the engine would be considered new at the time of importation.
