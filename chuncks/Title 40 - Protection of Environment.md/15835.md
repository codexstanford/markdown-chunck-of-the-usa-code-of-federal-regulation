######## Volatility test.

(5)The volatility test challenges the candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol. This aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a reference method sampler for a specified time period. Clean air is then passed through the samplers during a blow-off time period. Residual mass is then calculated as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase is subtracted from the initial weight of the filter. Acceptance criteria are based on a comparison of the residual mass measured by the candidate sampler (corrected for flow rate variations from that of the reference method) to the residual mass measured by the reference method sampler for several specified clean air sampling time periods.
