###### ยง 180.40 Tolerances for crop groups.
####### General.

(f)(1)EPA will not establish a crop group for a pesticide unless all tolerances made necessary by the presence of pesticide residues in the crop group commodities have been issued or are being issued simultaneously with the crop group tolerance. For purposes of paragraph (f)(1):

(i) Necessary tolerances for residues resulting from crop group tolerances include:

(A) Tolerances for processed food, including processed animal feed, to the extent needed under FFDCA section 408(a)(2).

(B) Tolerances for raw commodities not covered by the crop group tolerance that are derivative of commodities in the group.

(C) Tolerances for meat, milk, or egg products that may contain residues as a result of livestock's consumption of animal feed containing pesticide residues to the extent needed under ยง 180.6(b).

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tolerance is not considered necessary for processed food, derivative raw commodities, or meat, milk, and eggs if the precursor raw commodities are grown solely for sale as raw commodities and are completely segregated from commodities grown for the purpose of producing processed foods, derivative raw commodities, and commodities, or fractions thereof, that are used as animal feed.
