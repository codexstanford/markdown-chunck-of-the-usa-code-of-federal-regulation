####### Determination of attainment.

(c)Effective January 4, 2010, EPA is determining that the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
