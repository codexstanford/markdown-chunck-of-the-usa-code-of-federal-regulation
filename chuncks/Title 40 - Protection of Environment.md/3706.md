####### ยง 49.4170 Delegation of authority of administration to the Tribe.
######## How is the delegation of administration accomplished?

(c)(1) A Delegation of Authority Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the delegation and specifying the provisions of this rule that the Ute Indian Tribe will be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA will be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the Ute Indian Tribe. The Agreement will become effective on the date that both the Regional Administrator and the authorized representative of the Ute Indian Tribe have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the Ute Indian Tribe will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for assisting the EPA with administration of the FIP and will act as the Regional Administrator as that term is used in these regulations. Any Delegation of Authority Agreement will clarify the circumstances in which the term "Regional Administrator" found throughout the FIP is to remain the EPA Regional Administrator and when it is intended to refer to the "Ute Indian Tribe," instead.

(2) A Delegation of Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with the Ute Indian Tribe.
