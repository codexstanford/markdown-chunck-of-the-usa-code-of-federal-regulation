####### Emissions data.

(e)(1) The point source inventory on which the summary of the baseline for lead emissions inventory is based must contain all sources that emit 0.5 or more tons of lead per year.

(2) Each State must submit lead emissions data to the appropriate EPA Regional Office with the original plan. The submission must be made with the plan, but not as part of the plan, and must include emissions data and information related to point and area source emissions. The emission data and information should include the information identified in the Hazardous and Trace Emissions System (HATREMS) point source coding forms for all point sources and the area source coding forms for all sources that are not point sources, but need not necessarily be in the format of those forms.
