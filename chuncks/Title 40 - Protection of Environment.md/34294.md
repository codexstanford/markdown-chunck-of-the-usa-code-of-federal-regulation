######## Method 24.

(1)You may determine the volatile organic and coating solids mass fraction of each coating applied using Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60). The Method 24 determination may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. When using volatile organic compound content as a surrogate for HAP, you may also use ASTM D3960-98, (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14) as an alternative to Method 24. If these values cannot be determined using either of these methods, you must submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.
