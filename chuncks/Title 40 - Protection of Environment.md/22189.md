###### 6.2.5 Sampling Pump.

For systems similar to the one shown in Figure 7E-1, a leak-free pump is needed to pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. The pump may be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled. For dilution-type measurement systems, an ejector pump (eductor) is used to create a vacuum that draws the sample through a critical orifice at a constant rate.
