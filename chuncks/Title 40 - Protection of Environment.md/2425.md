####### Loans to privately-owned systems.

(f)In cases where State monies cannot be used to provide loans to privately-owned systems, a State may draw 100 percent Federal monies for costs incurred by privately-owned systems. When Federal monies are drawn for incurred costs, the State must deposit or have previously deposited into the Fund the required match associated with the amount of cash drawn. Every 18 months, the State must submit documentation showing that it has met its proportionate Federal share within the last 6 months. If a State is unable to document that it has met its proportionate Federal share, State match deposited into the Fund must be expended before Federal monies are drawn for costs incurred by publicly-owned systems until the State meets its proportionate Federal share.
