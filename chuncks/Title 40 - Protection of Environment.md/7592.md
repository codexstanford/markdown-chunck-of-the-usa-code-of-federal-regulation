###### ยง 52.64 Determination of attainment.

Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007-2009, EPA determined that the Chattanooga, Alabama-Georgia-Tennessee PMnonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Chattanooga, Alabama-Georgia-Tennessee PMnonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
