####### Cover

means a device which is placed on top of or over a material such that the entire surface area of the material is enclosed and sealed. A cover may have openings (such as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells) if those openings are necessary for operation, inspection, maintenance, or repair of the unit on which the cover is installed, provided that each opening is closed and sealed when the opening is not in use. In addition, a cover may have one or more safety devices. Examples of a cover include, but are not limited to, a fixed-roof installed on a tank, an external floating roof installed on a tank, and a lid installed on a drum or other container.
