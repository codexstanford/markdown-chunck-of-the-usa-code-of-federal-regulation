(2) For non-motor vehicle sources, including stationary and area source emissions, the latest emission factors specified by EPA in the "Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors" (AP-42,) must be used for the conformity analysis unless more accurate emission data are available, such as actual stack test data from the stationary sources which are part of the conformity analysis.

(c) The air quality modeling analyses required under this subpart must be based on the applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in the most recent version of the "Guideline on Air Quality Models." (Appendix W to 40 CFR part 51).

(1) The guideline techniques are inappropriate, in which case the model may be modified or another model substituted on a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific Federal agency program; and

(2) Written approval of the EPA Regional Administrator is obtained for any modification or substitution.

(d) The analyses required under this subpart must be based on the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action and must reflect emission scenarios that are expected to occur under each of the following cases:

(1) The attainment year specified in the SIP, or if the SIP does not specify an attainment year, the latest attainment year possible under the Act; or

(2) The last year for which emissions are projected in the maintenance plan;

(3) The year during which the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is expected to be the greatest on an annual basis; and

(4) Any year for which the applicable SIP specifies an emissions budget.
