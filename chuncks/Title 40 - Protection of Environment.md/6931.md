b. Given the relatively inert nature of SOon the short-term time scales of interest (1-hour) and the sources of SO(stationary point sources), the general modeling requirements for screening models in section 4.2.1 and refined models in section 4.2.2 are applicable for SOmodeling applications. For urban areas, AERMOD automatically invokes a half-life of 4 hoursto SOTherefore, care must be taken when determining whether a source is urban or rural (section 7.2.1.1 for urban/rural determination methodology).

a. Models for assessing the impact of sources on ambient NOconcentrations are needed to meet NSR requirements to address compliance with the NONAAQS and PSD increments. Impact of an individual source on ambient NOdepends, in part, on the chemical environment into which the source's plume is to be emitted. This is due to the fact that NOsources co-emit NO along with NOand any emitted NO may react with ambient ozone to convert to additional NOdownwind. Thus, comprehensive modeling of NOwould need to consider the ratio of emitted NO and NO, the ambient levels of ozone and subsequent reactions between ozone and NO, and the photolysis of NOto NO.
