####### Compliance certification.

(c)In the compliance certification report under paragraph (a) of this section, the NOauthorized account representative shall certify, based on reasonable inquiry of those persons with primary responsibility for operating the source and the NOBudget units at the source in compliance with the NOBudget Trading Program, whether each NOBudget unit for which the compliance certification is submitted was operated during the calendar year covered by the report in compliance with the requirements of the NOBudget Trading Program applicable to the unit, including:

(1) Whether the unit was operated in compliance with the NOBudget emissions limitation;

(2) Whether the monitoring plan that governs the unit has been maintained to reflect the actual operation and monitoring of the unit and contains all information necessary to attribute NOemissions to the unit, in accordance with subpart H of this part;

(3) Whether all the NOemissions from the unit, or a group of units (including the unit) using a common stack, were monitored or accounted for through the missing data procedures and reported in the quarterly monitoring reports, including whether conditional data were reported in the quarterly reports in accordance with subpart H of this part. If conditional data were reported, the owner or operator shall indicate whether the status of all conditional data has been resolved and all necessary quarterly report resubmissions have been made;

(4) Whether the facts that form the basis for certification under subpart H of this part of each monitor at the unit or a group of units (including the unit) using a common stack, or for using an excepted monitoring method or alternative monitoring method approved under subpart H of this part, if any, have changed; and

(5) If a change is required to be reported under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, specify the nature of the change, the reason for the change, when the change occurred, and how the unit's compliance status was determined subsequent to the change, including what method was used to determine emissions when a change mandated the need for monitor recertification.
