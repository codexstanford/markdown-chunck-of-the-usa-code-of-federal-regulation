(a)An end-use product will be restricted to use by certified applicators (or persons under their direct supervision) if the Agency determines that:

(1) Its toxicity exceeds one or more of the specific hazard criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or evidence described in paragraph (d) of this section substantiates that the product or use poses a serious hazard that may be mitigated by restricting its use;

(2) Its labeling, when considered according to the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, is not adequate to mitigate these hazard(s);

(3) Restriction of the product would decrease the risk of adverse effects; and

(4) The decrease in risks of the pesticide as a result of restriction would exceed the decrease in benefits.
