####### 3,Permitting Agencies' breakdown/malfunction rules.

()Section 93102(i)(4) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure provides that the owner or operator shall report breakdowns as required by the permitting agency's breakdown rule. Under this rule substitution, the permitting agencies' breakdown rules do not override or supplant the requirements of section 93102(g)(4), (h)(5), (h)(6), (i)(3)(B), or Appendix 3; neither expand the scope nor extend the time-frame of a breakdown beyond the definition of section 93102(b)(7); and do not grant the permitting agencies the authority to determine whether a breakdown has occurred, to grant emergency variances, or to decide to take no enforcement action. Owners or operators must submit written breakdown reports even if the permitting agency has not formally requested such reports.
