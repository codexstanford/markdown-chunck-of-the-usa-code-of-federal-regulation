###### ยง 80.1415 How are equivalence values assigned to renewable fuel?

(a)(1) Each gallon of a renewable fuel, or gallon equivalent pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section, shall be assigned an equivalence value by the producer or importer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

(2) The equivalence value is a number that is used to determine how many gallon-RINs can be generated for a gallon of renewable fuel according to ยง 80.1426.

(b) Equivalence values shall be assigned for certain renewable fuels as follows:

(1) Ethanol which is denatured shall have an equivalence value of 1.0.

(2) Biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) shall have an equivalence value of 1.5.

(3) Butanol shall have an equivalence value of 1.3.

(4) Non-ester renewable diesel with a lower heating value of at least 123,500 Btu/gal shall have an equivalence value of 1.7.

(5) 77,000 Btu (lower heating value) of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) shall represent one gallon of renewable fuel with an equivalence value of 1.0.

(6) 22.6 kW-hr of electricity shall represent one gallon of renewable fuel with an equivalence value of 1.0.

(7) For all other renewable fuels, a producer or importer shall submit an application to the Agency for an equivalence value following the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. A producer or importer may also submit an application for an alternative equivalence value pursuant to paragraph (c) if the renewable fuel is listed in this paragraph (b), but the producer or importer has reason to believe that a different equivalence value than that listed in this paragraph (b) is warranted.
