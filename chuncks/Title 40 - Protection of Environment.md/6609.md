#### PART 51 - REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
##### Appendix P to Part 51 - Minimum Emission Monitoring Requirements
###### Purpose.

1This appendix P sets forth the minimum requirements for continuous emission monitoring and recording that each State Implementation Plan must include in order to be approved under the provisions of 40 CFR 51.214. These requirements include the source categories to be affected; emission monitoring, recording, and reporting requirements for those sources; performance specifications for accuracy, reliability, and durability of acceptable monitoring systems; and techniques to convert emission data to units of the applicable State emission standard. Such data must be reported to the State as an indication of whether proper maintenance and operating procedures are being utilized by source operators to maintain emission levels at or below emission standards. Such data may be used directly or indirectly for compliance determination or any other purpose deemed appropriate by the State. Though the monitoring requirements are specified in detail, States are given some flexibility to resolve difficulties that may arise during the implementation of these regulations.
