###### i.e.

(1) As shown in Example 1, this monitoring site meets the primary and secondary Ostandards because the 3-year average of the annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average Oconcentrations (, 0.075666 * * * ppm, truncated to 0.075 ppm) is less than or equal to 0.075 ppm. The data completeness requirement is also met because the average percent of days within the required monitoring season with valid ambient monitoring data is greater than 90%, and no single year has less than 75% data completeness. In Example 1, the individual 8-hour averages used to determine the annual fourth maximum have also been truncated to the third decimal place.
