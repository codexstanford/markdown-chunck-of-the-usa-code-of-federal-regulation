####### ยง 1065.365 Nonmethane cutter penetration fractions.
######## System requirements.,PF,PF

(c)We do not limit NMC penetration fractions to a certain range. However, we recommend that you optimize a nonmethane cutter by adjusting its temperature to achieve a>0.85 and a<0.02, as determined by paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as applicable. If we use a nonmethane cutter for testing, it will meet this recommendation. If adjusting NMC temperature does not result in achieving both of these specifications simultaneously, we recommend that you replace the catalyst material. Use the most recently determined penetration values from this section to calculate HC emissions according to ยง 1065.660 and ยง 1065.665 as applicable.
