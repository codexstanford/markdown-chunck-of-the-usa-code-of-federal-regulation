###### Emission Limitations
####### § 63.3491 What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
######## Control efficiency/outlet concentration option.

(d)Demonstrate that, based on the emission reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, total HAP emissions measured as total hydrocarbon (THC) are reduced by 95 percent or greater for existing sources, or 97 percent or greater for new or reconstructed sources, or that outlet THC emissions are less than or equal to 20 parts per million by volume, dry basis (ppmvd). If you use this compliance option, you must have a capture device that meets EPA Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M criteria for a permanent total enclosure (PTE). You must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) used for purposes of complying with this subpart meet the operating limits required in § 63.3492, and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.3493. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3550 through 63.3557 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
