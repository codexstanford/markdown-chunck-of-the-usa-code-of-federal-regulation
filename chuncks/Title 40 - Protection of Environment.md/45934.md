###### ยง 86.004-2 Definitions.
####### Warranty period,

for purposes of HDE emissions defect warranty and emissions performance warranty, shall be a period of 5 years/50,000 miles, whichever occurs first, for Otto-cycle HDEs and light heavy-duty diesel engines. For all other heavy-duty diesel engines the aforementioned period shall be 5 years/100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. However, in no case may this period be less than the basic mechanical warranty period that the manufacturer provides (with or without additional charge) to the purchaser of the engine. Extended warranties on select parts do not extend the emissions warranty requirements for the entire engine but only for those parts. In cases where responsibility for an extended warranty is shared between the owner and the manufacturer, the emissions warranty shall also be shared in the same manner as specified in the warranty agreement.
