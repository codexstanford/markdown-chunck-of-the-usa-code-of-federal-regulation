(i) Calculate arithmetic mean values for vehicle speed,, wind speed,, and wind direction,, over each 10 second increment for each test segment. Disregard data from the final increment of the test segment if it is less than 10 seconds.

(ii) Calculate the theoretical air direction, &#x3C8;, for each 10 second increment using the following equation:

(iii) Perform a linear regression using paired values of &#x3C8;and measured air direction, &#x3C8;, from each 10 second increment for all 50 mi/hr and 70 mi/hr test segments to determine the air-direction correction coefficients,andbased on the following equation:

(iv) For all 50 mi/hr and 70 mi/hr test segments, correct each measured value of air direction using the following equation:
