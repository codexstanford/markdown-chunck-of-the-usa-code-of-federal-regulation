#### PART 1027 - FEES FOR VEHICLE AND ENGINE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
##### ยง 1027.135 What provisions apply to a deficient filing?

(a) Any filing under this part is deficient if it is not accompanied by a completed fee filing form and full payment of the appropriate fee.

(b) We will hold a deficient filing along with any payment until we receive a completed form and full payment. If the filing remains deficient at the end of the model year, we will continue to hold any funds associated with the filing so you can make a timely request for a refund. We will not process an application for certification if the associated filing is deficient.
