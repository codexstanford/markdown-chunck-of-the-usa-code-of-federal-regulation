###### § 797.1930 Mysid shrimp acute toxicity test.
####### Dilution water.

(iv)(A) Natural or artificial seawater is acceptable as dilution water if mysids will survive and successfully reproduce in it for the duration of the holding, acclimating and testing periods without showing signs of stress, such as reduced growth and fecundity. Mysids shall be cultured and tested in dilution water from the same origin.

(B) Natural seawater shall be filtered through a filter with a pore size of <20 microns prior to use in a test.

(C) Artificial seawater can be prepared by adding commercially available formulations or by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized water. Deionized water with a conductivity less than 1 µohm/cm at 12 &#xB0;C is acceptable for making artificial seawater. When deionized water is prepared from a ground or surface water source, conductivity and total organic carbon (or chemical oxygen demand) shall be measured on each batch.
