###### Flow control device:

7.1.6A calibrated rotameter and needle valve combination capable of maintaining and measuring air flow to within +/-2 percent is suitable for short-term sampling but may not be used for long-term sampling. A critical orifice can be used for regulating flow rate for both long-term and short-term sampling. A 22-gauge hypodermic needle 25 mm long may be used as a critical orifice to yield a flow rate of approximately 1 L/min for a 30-minute sampling period. When sampling for 1 hour, a 23-gauge hypodermic needle 16 mm in length will provide a flow rate of approximately 0.5 L/min. Flow control for a 24-hour sample may be provided by a 27-gauge hypodermic needle critical orifice that is 9.5 mm in length. The flow rate should be in the range of 0.18 to 0.22 L/min.
