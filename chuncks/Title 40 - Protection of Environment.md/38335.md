4.1.1.5.2Calculate the relative accuracy (RA) of the monitoring system, on a Âµg/scm basis, as described in section 12 of Performance Specification (PS) 2 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter (see Equations 2-3 through 2-6 of PS 2). For purposes of calculating the relative accuracy, ensure that the reference method and monitoring system data are on a consistent basis, either wet or dry. The CEMS must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1 of this appendix.
