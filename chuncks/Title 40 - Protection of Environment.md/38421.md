10.1.3For HCl and/or HF CEMS, the owner or operator must record the following information for each unit or stack operating hour:

10.1.3.1 The date and hour;

10.1.3.2 Monitoring system and component identification codes, as provided in the electronic monitoring plan, for each hour in which the CEMS provides a quality-assured value of HCl or HF concentration (as applicable);

10.1.3.3 The pollutant concentration, for each hour in which a quality-assured value is obtained. For HCl and HF, record the data in parts per million (ppm), with one leading non-zero digit and one decimal place, expressed in scientific notation. Use the following rounding convention: If the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 5 or greater, round the first decimal place upward (increase it by one); if the digit immediately following the first decimal place is 4 or less, leave the first decimal place unchanged.

10.1.3.4 A special code, indicating whether or not a quality-assured HCl or HF concentration value is obtained for the hour. This code may be entered manually when a temporary like-kind replacement HCl or HF analyzer is used for reporting; and

10.1.3.5 Monitor data availability, as a percentage of unit or stack operating hours, calculated according to ยง 75.32 of this chapter.
