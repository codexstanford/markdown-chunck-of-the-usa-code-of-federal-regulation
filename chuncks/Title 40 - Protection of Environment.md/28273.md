####### Flexographic press

means an unwind or feed section, which may include more than one unwind or feed station (such as on a laminator), a series of individual work stations, one or more of which is a flexographic print station, any dryers (including interstage dryers and overhead tunnel dryers) associated with the work stations, and a rewind, stack, or collection section. The work stations may be oriented vertically, horizontally, or around the circumference of a single large impression cylinder. Inboard and outboard work stations, including those employing any other technology, such as rotogravure, are included if they are capable of printing or coating on the same substrate. A publication rotogravure press with one or more flexographic imprinters is not a flexographic press.
