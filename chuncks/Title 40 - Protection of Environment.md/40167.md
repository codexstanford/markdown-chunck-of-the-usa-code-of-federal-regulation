###### Sampling QA/QC.

12.2The analyte spike procedure of section 9 of this method, the QA spike of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the validation procedure of section 13 of this method are used to evaluate the performance of the sampling system and to quantify sampling system effects, if any, on the measured concentrations. This method is self-validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 9.0 and 8.6.2 of this method and results from a previous method validation study support the use of this method in the application. Several factors can contribute to uncertainty in the measurement of spiked samples. Factors which can be controlled to provide better accuracy in the spiking procedure are listed in sections 12.2.1 through 12.2.4 of this method.
