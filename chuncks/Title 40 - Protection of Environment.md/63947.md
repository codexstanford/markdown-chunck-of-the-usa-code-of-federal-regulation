##### ยง 228.15 Dumping sites designated on a final basis.
###### Periodic confirmatory monitoring.

(D)At least once every three years, the following confirmatory monitoring activities will be conducted and results compiled in a report which will be available for public review: Samples of sediments taken from the dredged material footprint shall be subjected to bioassay testing using one or more appropriate sensitive marine species consistent with applicable ocean disposal testing guidance ("Green Book" or related Regional Implementation Agreements), as determined by the Regional Administrator, to confirm whether contaminated sediments are being deposited at the SF-DODS despite extensive pre-disposal testing. In addition, near-surface arrays of appropriate filter-feeding organisms (such as mussels) shall be deployed in at least three locations in and around the disposal site for at least one month during active site use, to confirm whether substantial bioaccumulation of contaminants may be associated with exposure to suspended sediment plumes from multiple disposal events. One array must be deployed outside the influence of any expected plumes to serve as a baseline reference.
