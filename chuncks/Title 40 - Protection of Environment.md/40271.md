8.8See the FTIR Protocol. Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio, and all sample spectra should have unique file names. Two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra will be stored on separate computer media. For each sample spectrum the analyst must document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, integration time), and the spectral file name. A hard copy of these data must be maintained until the test results are accepted.
