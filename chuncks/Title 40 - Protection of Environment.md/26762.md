() If a recovery device was added as part of a pollution prevention project, the percent reduction shall be demonstrated by conducting a performance test at the inlet and outlet of that recovery device.

(B) For a Group 2 continuous front-end process vent controlled using a technology with an approved nominal efficiency greater than 98 percent or a pollution prevention measure achieving greater than 98 percent reduction, Equation 44 shall be used.

(iv) Emissions from Group 2 continuous front-end process vents at baseline, ECFEPV2, shall be calculated as follows:

(A) If the continuous front-end process vent was uncontrolled on November 15, 1990, ECFEPV2= ECFEPV2and shall be calculated according to the procedures and equation for ECFEPVin paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

(B) If the continuous front-end process vent was controlled on November 15, 1990, Equation 45 shall be used.
