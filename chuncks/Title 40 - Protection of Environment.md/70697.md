###### Pretest preparation.,Preparation and analysis of oil standards.,i.e.

2.42.4.12.4.1.1 Standard solutions of oil for calibrating the UV-visible spectrophotometer are prepared with the specific reference oils and dispersant used for a particular set of experimental test runs. For experiments with no dispersant, only oil is used to make the standard solution. For experiments with the oil plus dispersant, the standard is made with a 1:10 (v:v) mixture of the dispersant to the test oil (, a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10). This ratio is used in the test tank with dispersant added. The presence of water and certain dispersants in DCM extracts can affect absorbance readings in a spectrophotometer. All standard solutions of oil (and dispersant, if present) should be prepared in a stepwise manner that reflects the analytical protocol used for the experimental water samples.
