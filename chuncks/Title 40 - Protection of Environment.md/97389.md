(i)A study plan for each specific test for each subject chemical substance must be received by EPA by February 20, 2012 unless an extension is granted in writing pursuant to 40 CFR 790.55. A final report for each specific test for each subject chemical substance must be received by EPA by December 21, 2012 unless an extension is granted in writing pursuant to 40 CFR 790.55. EPA is also requesting that a robust summary of the final report for each specific test be submitted in addition to, and at the same time as, the final report.

Guidance for the compilation of robust summaries is described in a document entitled "Draft Guidance on Developing Robust Summaries" which is available online at
