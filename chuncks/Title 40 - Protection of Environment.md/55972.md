###### ยง 141.81 Applicability of corrosion control treatment steps to small, medium, and large water systems.
####### Step 1.

(1)(i) A water system other than those covered in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section shall recommend re-optimized optimal corrosion control treatment (ยง 141.82(c)) within six months after the end of the tap sampling period during which it exceeds either the lead trigger level or copper action level. States may approve modifications of the existing corrosion control treatment without a study for systems that exceed the lead trigger level, but do not exceed the lead or copper action level. The State shall specify re-optimized corrosion control treatment within six months of receiving the treatment recommendation. The system shall complete modifications to corrosion control treatment to have re-optimized corrosion control treatment installed within six months of the State specifying re-optimized corrosion control treatment.

(ii) A water system with lead service lines that exceeds the lead action level must harvest lead pipes from the distribution system and construct flow-through pipe loops and operate the loops with finished water within one year after the end of the tap sampling period during which it exceeds the lead action level. These water systems must proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and conduct the corrosion control studies for re-optimization under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section using the pipe loops.
