###### Exemptions from certain conditions.

B.The reviewing authority may exempt the following sources from Condition 1 under section III.D. of this Ruling or Conditions 3 and 4 under section IV.A. of this Ruling:

(i) Resource recovery facilities burning municipal solid waste, and (ii) sources which must switch fuels due to lack of adequate fuel supplies or where a source is required to be modified as a result of EPA regulations (e.g., lead-in-fuel requirements) and no exemption from such regulation is available to the source. Such an exemption may be granted only if:

1. The applicant demonstrates that it made its best efforts to obtain sufficient emission offsets to comply with Condition 1 under section III.D. of this Ruling or Conditions 3 and 4 under section IV.A. of this Ruling and that such efforts were unsuccessful;

2. The applicant has secured all available emission offsets; and

3. The applicant will continue to seek the necessary emission offsets and apply them when they become available.

Such an exemption may result in the need to revise the SIP to provide additional control of existing sources.

Temporary emission sources, such as pilot plants, portable facilities which will be relocated outside of the nonattainment area after a short period of time, and emissions resulting from the construction phase of a new source, are exempt from Conditions 3 and 4 of this section.
