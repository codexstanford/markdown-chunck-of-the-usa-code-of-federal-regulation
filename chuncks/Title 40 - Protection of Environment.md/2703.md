(c)-(1)Credits are limited to State site-specific expenses that EPA determines to be reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket expenditures of non-Federal funds for remedial action, as defined in CERCLA section 101(24), that are consistent with a permanent remedy at the site. Credits are established on a site-specific basis. Only a State may claim credit.

(i) The State may claim credit for response activity obligations or expenditures incurred by the State or political subdivision between January 1, 1978, and December 11, 1980.

(ii) The State may claim credit for remedial action expenditures made by the State after October 17, 1986. If such expenditures occurred after the site was listed on the NPL (Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 300), they will be eligible for a credit only if the State initiated the remedial action after obtaining EPA's written approval.

(iii) The State may not claim credit for removal actions taken after December 11, 1980.
