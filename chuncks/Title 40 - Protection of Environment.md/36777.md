###### Notification, Reports, and Records
####### § 63.7555 What records must I keep?
######## e.g.,

(12) If you choose to rely on paragraph (2) of the definition of "startup" in § 63.7575, for each startup period, you must maintain records of the hourly steam temperature, hourly steam pressure, hourly steam flow, hourly flue gas temperature, and all hourly average CMS data (CEMS, PM CPMS, COMS, ESP total secondary electric power input, scrubber pressure drop, scrubber liquid flow rate) collected during each startup period to confirm that the control devices are engaged. In addition, if compliance with the PM emission limit is demonstrated using a PM control device, you must maintain records as specified in paragraphs (d)(12)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) For a boiler or process heater with an electrostatic precipitator, record the number of fields in service, as well as each field's secondary voltage and secondary current during each hour of startup.

(ii) For a boiler or process heater with a fabric filter, record the number of compartments in service, as well as the differential pressure across the baghouse during each hour of startup.

(iii) For a boiler or process heater with a wet scrubber needed for filterable PM control, record the scrubber's liquid flow rate and the pressure drop during each hour of startup.

(13) If you choose to use paragraph (2) of the definition of "startup" in § 63.7575 and you find that you are unable to safely engage and operate your PM control(s) within 1 hour of first firing of non-clean fuels, you may choose to rely on paragraph (1) of definition of "startup" in § 63.7575 or you may submit to the delegated permitting authority a request for a variance with the PM controls requirement, as described below.

(i) The request shall provide evidence of a documented manufacturer-identified safety issue.

(ii) The request shall provide information to document that the PM control device is adequately designed and sized to meet the applicable PM emission limit.

(iii) In addition, the request shall contain documentation that:

(A) The unit is using clean fuels to the maximum extent possible to bring the unit and PM control device up to the temperature necessary to alleviate or prevent the identified safety issues prior to the combustion of primary fuel;

(B) The unit has explicitly followed the manufacturer's procedures to alleviate or prevent the identified safety issue; and

(C) Identifies with specificity the details of the manufacturer's statement of concern.

(iv) You must comply with all other work practice requirements, including but not limited to data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.

(e) If you elect to average emissions consistent with § 63.7522, you must additionally keep a copy of the emission averaging implementation plan required in § 63.7522(g), all calculations required under § 63.7522, including monthly records of heat input or steam generation, as applicable, and monitoring records consistent with § 63.7541.

(f) If you elect to use efficiency credits from energy conservation measures to demonstrate compliance according to § 63.7533, you must keep a copy of the Implementation Plan required in § 63.7533(d) and copies of all data and calculations used to establish credits according to § 63.7533(b), (c), and (f).

(g) If you elected to demonstrate that the unit meets the specification for mercury for the unit designed to burn gas 1 subcategory, you must maintain monthly records (or at the frequency required by § 63.7540(c)) of the calculations and results of the fuel specification for mercury in Table 6.

(h) If you operate a unit in the unit designed to burn gas 1 subcategory that is subject to this subpart, and you use an alternative fuel other than natural gas, refinery gas, gaseous fuel subject to another subpart under this part, other gas 1 fuel, or gaseous fuel subject to another subpart of this part or part 60, 61, or 65, you must keep records of the total hours per calendar year that alternative fuel is burned and the total hours per calendar year that the unit operated during periods of gas curtailment or gas supply emergencies.
