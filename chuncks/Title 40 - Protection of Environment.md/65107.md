###### Design Criteria
####### ยง 257.74 Structural integrity criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and any lateral expansion of a CCR surface impoundment.
######## Periodic structural stability assessments.

(d)(1) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must conduct initial and periodic structural stability assessments and document whether the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the CCR unit is consistent with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices for the maximum volume of CCR and CCR wastewater which can be impounded therein. The assessment must, at a minimum, document whether the CCR unit has been designed, constructed, operated, and maintained with:

(i) Stable foundations and abutments;

(ii) Adequate slope protection to protect against surface erosion, wave action, and adverse effects of sudden drawdown;

(iii) Dikes mechanically compacted to a density sufficient to withstand the range of loading conditions in the CCR unit;

(iv) Vegetated slopes of dikes and surrounding areas not to exceed a height of six inches above the slope of the dike, except for slopes which have an alternate form or forms of slope protection;

(v) A single spillway or a combination of spillways configured as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section. The combined capacity of all spillways must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to adequately manage flow during and following the peak discharge from the event specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section.

(A) All spillways must be either:
