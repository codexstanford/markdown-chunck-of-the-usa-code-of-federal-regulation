######## Participation in the NVMSRP.

(2) You must certify in your initial notification of compliance status required by ยง 63.7840(f) and semiannual compliance report required by ยง 63.7841(a) that you purchased post-consumer steel scrap containing motor vehicle scrap according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and identify all your scrap providers in your semiannual compliance report;

(3) If you purchase scrap from a broker, you must certify that all scrap received from that broker was obtained from other scrap providers who participate in the NVMSRP and identify all scrap providers used by all your scrap brokers in your semiannual compliance report; and

(4) You must conduct periodic inspections or provide other means of corroboration to ensure that scrap providers and brokers participate in the NVMSRP and, therefore, are aware of the need for and are implementing appropriate steps to minimize the presence of mercury in scrap from end-of-life vehicles.
