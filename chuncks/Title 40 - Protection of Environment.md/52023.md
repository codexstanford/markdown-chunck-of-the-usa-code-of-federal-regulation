####### Unabated emissions

means a gas stream containing fluorinated GHG or NO that has exited the process, but which has not yet been introduced into an abatement system to reduce the mass of fluorinated GHG or NO in the stream. If the emissions from the process are not routed to an abatement system, or are routed to an abatement device that is not in an operational mode, unabated emissions are those fluorinated GHG or NO released to the atmosphere.
