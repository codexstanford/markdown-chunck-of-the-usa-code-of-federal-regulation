###### Accelerated Aftertreatment Aging
####### ยง 1065.1145 Execution of accelerated aging, cycle tracking, and cycle validation criteria.
######## Preliminary cycle validation runs.

(a)Prior to the start of aging, conduct a number of practice runs to tune the cycle parameters. It is recommended that initial practice runs be conducted without the aftertreatment installed, but with the backpressure of the aftertreatment simulated to help ensure that the tuned cycle is representative. For final cycle tuning, including regenerations, it is recommended to use a duplicate or spare aftertreatment system of similar design to the target system, to avoid damage or excessive initial aging during the tuning. However, it is permissible to conduct final tuning using the target system being aged, but you must limit the total duration to no more than 100 field equivalent hours (10 hours of accelerated aging), including both thermal and chemical components. The process followed for these initial runs will vary depending on whether you are using an engine-based platform or a burner-based platform.
