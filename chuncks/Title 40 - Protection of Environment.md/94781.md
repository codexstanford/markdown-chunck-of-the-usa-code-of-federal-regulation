####### Recordkeeping.

For protection from liability, and considering possible future requirements for notification on disposal site deeds, a landfill owner should maintain documentation of the specific location and quantity of the buried asbestos wastes. In addition, the estimated depth of the waste below the surface should be recorded whenever a landfill section is closed. As mentioned previously, such information should be recorded in the land deed or other record along with a notice warning against excavation of the area.
