####### ยง 51.15 What data does my state need to report to EPA?
######## e.g.,

(4) Emissions for wild and prescribed fires are not required to be reported by states. If states wish to optionally report these sources, they must be reported to the events data category. The events data category is a day-specific accounting of these large-scale but usually short duration emissions. Submissions must include both daily emissions estimates as well as daily acres burned values. In lieu of submitting this information, states may accept the EPA estimates or they may submit inputs (acres burned, fuel loads) for us to use in the EPA's estimation approach.
