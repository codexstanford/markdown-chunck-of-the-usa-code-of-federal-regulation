####### Calculation of percent reduction efficiency.

(5)The following procedures shall be used to calculate percent reduction efficiency:

(i) Test duration shall be as specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) (A) through (B) of this section, as appropriate.

(ii) The mass rate of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP of the HAP of concern (E, E) shall be computed.

(A) The following equations shall be used:

(B) Where the mass rate of TOC is being calculated, all organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) measured by Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A are summed using Equations 4 and 5 in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.

(C) Where the mass rate of total organic HAP is being calculated, only the organic HAP species shall be summed using Equations 4 and 5 in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.

(iii) The percent reduction in TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP shall be calculated using Equation 6 as follows:

(iv) If the process vent stream entering a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel, the weight-percent reduction of total organic HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) across the device shall be determined by comparing the TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP in all combusted process vent streams and primary and secondary fuels with the TOC (minus methane and ethane) or total organic HAP, respectively, exiting the combustion device.
