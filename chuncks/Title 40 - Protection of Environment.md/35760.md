####### ยง 63.5335 How do I determine the actual HAP loss?

(a) This section describes the information and procedures you must use to determine the actual HAP loss from your leather finishing operation. By the fifteenth of each month, you must determine the actual HAP loss in pounds from your leather finishing operation for the previous month.

(b) Use one of the procedures listed in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section for determining the actual HAP loss from your affected sources. Regardless of which procedure is used to determine HAP loss, each source is still required to maintain a written or printed log that documents the total quantity of solvents/finishes used each month in the process and the mass fraction of HAP in each solvent/finish.
