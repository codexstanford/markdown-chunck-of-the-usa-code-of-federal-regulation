of releases refers to the following size classifications which are provided as guidance to the OSC for meeting pollution reporting requirements in subpart B.

(1) Minor release means a release of a quantity of hazardous substance(s), pollutant(s), or contaminant(s) that poses minimal threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment.

(2) Medium release means a release not meeting the criteria for classification as a minor or major release.

(3) Major release means a release of any quantity of hazardous substance(s), pollutant(s), or contaminant(s) that poses a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment or results in significant public concern.
