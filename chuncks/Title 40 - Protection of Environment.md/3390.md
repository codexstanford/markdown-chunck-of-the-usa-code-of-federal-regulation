####### § 49.158 Synthetic minor source permits.
######## What are my responsibilities under this program for my source that already has synthetic minor source or synthetic minor HAP source status prior to the effective date of this rule (that is, prior to August 30, 2011),?

(c)

(1) If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP source was established pursuant to the FIPs applicable to the Indian reservations in Idaho, Oregon and Washington or was established under an EPA-approved rule or permit program limiting potential to emit, you do not need to take any action under this program unless you propose a modification for this existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP source on or after August 30, 2011. For these modifications, you need to obtain a permit pursuant to § 49.158 before you begin construction.

(2) If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP source was established under a permit with enforceable emissions limitations issued pursuant to part 71 of this chapter, the reviewing authority has the discretion to do any of the following:

(i) Allow you to maintain the synthetic minor status for your source through your permit under part 71 of this chapter, including subsequent renewals of that permit.

(ii) Require you to submit an application for a synthetic minor source permit under this program by September 4, 2012, subject to the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. The reviewing authority also has the discretion to require any additional requirements, including control technology requirements, based on the specific circumstances of the source.

(iii) Require you to submit an application for a synthetic minor source permit under this program at the same time that you apply to renew your permit under part 71 of this chapter, subject to the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. The reviewing authority also has the discretion to require any additional requirements, including control technology requirements, based on the specific circumstances of the source.

(3) If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP source was established through a mechanism other than those described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, you must submit an application for a synthetic minor source permit under this program by September 4, 2012, subject to the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section

(4) If you are required to obtain a synthetic minor source permit under this program for your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP source, the following provisions apply:

(i) After submitting your synthetic minor source permit application, you must respond in a timely manner to any requests from the reviewing authority for additional information.

(ii) Provided that you submit your application as required in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(3) (as applicable) and any requested additional information as required in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, your source will continue to be considered a synthetic minor source or synthetic minor HAP source (as applicable) until your synthetic minor source permit under this program has been issued. Issuance of your synthetic minor source permit under this program will be in accordance with the applicable requirements in §§ 49.154 and 49.155 and all other provisions under this section.

(iii) Should you fail to submit your application as required in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(3) (as applicable) or any requested additional information as required in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, your source will no longer be considered a synthetic minor source or synthetic minor HAP source (as applicable) and will become subject to all requirements for major sources. In the case of sources subject to section (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the renewed part 71 permit will not contain enforceable emissions limitations and instead will include applicable major source requirements.
