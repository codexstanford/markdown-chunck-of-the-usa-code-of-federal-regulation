####### Assembling test intervals.

(d)A test interval may include multiple subintervals separated by periods with one or more exclusions under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(1) Treat these test subintervals as continuous for calculating duration of the test interval for engines subject to compression-ignition standards.

(2) Calculate emission mass during each test subinterval and sum those subinterval emission masses to determine the emission mass over the test interval. Calculate emisson mass as described in 40 CFR 1065.650(c)(2)(i), with the following exceptions and clarifications:

(i) Correct NOemissions for humidity as specified in 40 CFR 1065.670. Calculate corrections relative to ambient air humidity as measured by PEMS.

(ii) Disregard the provision in 40 CFR 1065.650(g) for setting negative emission mass to zero for test intervals and subintervals.
