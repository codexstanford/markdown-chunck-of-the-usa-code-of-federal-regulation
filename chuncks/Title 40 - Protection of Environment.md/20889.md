######## Reconstruction

means rebuilding an incineration unit and meeting two criteria:

(1) The reconstruction begins on or after June 16, 2006.

(2) The cumulative cost of the construction over the life of the incineration unit exceeds 50 percent of the original cost of building and installing the unit (not including land) updated to current costs (current dollars). For an OSWI unit, to determine what systems are within the boundary of the unit used to calculate these costs, see the definition of OSWI unit.
