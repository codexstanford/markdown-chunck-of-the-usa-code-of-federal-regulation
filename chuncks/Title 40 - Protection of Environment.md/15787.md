####### ยง 53.56 Test for effect of variations in ambient pressure.
######## Test setup.

(e)(1) Setup of the sampler shall be performed as required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in ยง 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in the pressure-controlled chamber in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and flow measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.

(2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.

(3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to the outlet of the flow rate meter.

(4) The barometer shall be installed in the test chamber such that it will accurately measure the air pressure to which the candidate sampler is subjected.
