####### Quality Assurance Requirements for Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems and Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers.

2.2.4To quality-assure the data from non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems and temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzers, the following provisions apply:

2.2.4.1 When a certified non-redundant backup sorbent trap monitoring system is brought into service, you must follow the procedures for routine day-to-day operation of the system, in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.

2.2.4.2 When a certified non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or a temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer is brought into service, a calibration error test and a linearity check must be performed and passed. A single point system integrity check is also required, unless a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg was used for the calibration error test.

2.2.4.3 Each non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer shall comply with all required daily, weekly, and quarterly quality-assurance test requirements in section 5 of this appendix, for as long as the system or analyzer remains in service.

2.2.4.4 For the routine, on-going quality-assurance of a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system, a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) must be performed and passed at least once every 8 calendar quarters at the unit or stack location(s) where the system will be used.

2.2.4.5 To use a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system or a temporary like-kind replacement analyzer for more than 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location, a RATA must first be performed and passed at that location.
