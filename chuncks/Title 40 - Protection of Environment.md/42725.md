(3) Hourly gross unit load (rounded to nearest MWge) (or steam load in 1000 lb/hr at stated temperature and pressure, rounded to the nearest 1000 lb/hr, or mmBtu/hr of thermal output, rounded to the nearest mmBtu/hr, if elected in the monitoring plan);

(4) Operating load range corresponding to hourly gross load of 1 to 10, except for units using a common stack or common pipe header, which may use up to 20 load ranges for stack or fuel flow, as specified in the monitoring plan;
