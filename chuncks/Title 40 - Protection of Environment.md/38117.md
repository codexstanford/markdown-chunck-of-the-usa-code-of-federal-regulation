###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.10005 What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date must I conduct them?
######## e.g.,

(4) A record of all parameters needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the emission standard (stack flow rate, diluent gas concentrations, hourly gross outputs) is available for the entire performance test period; and

(5) For each performance test based on stack test data, you certify, and keep documentation demonstrating, that the EGU configuration, control devices, and fuel(s) have remained consistent with conditions since the prior performance test was conducted.

(6) For performance stack test data that are collected prior to the date that compliance must be demonstrated and are used to demonstrate initial compliance with applicable emissions limits, the interval for subsequent stack tests begins on the date that compliance must be demonstrated.
