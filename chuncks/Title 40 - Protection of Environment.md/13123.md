(ii)A December 19, 2007, letter from Daniel Murray, Assistant Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental management, Office of Air Quality, which states that it would be acceptable to measure the concentration limits in 326 IAC 8-5-6 using EPA Method 25(a) expressed as equivalent ethanol with the calibration gas being a mixture of ethanol in air.

(183) On February 7, 2002, Indiana submitted revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for lead (Pb) as part of the State's incorporation of a Federal standard for secondary lead smelters. On October 3, 2006, and November 27, 2007, Indiana supplemented its request as it pertained to Quemetco, Incorporated, in Marion County. This revision removes from the Indiana SIP the source-specific provisions for Quemetco found in article 326 IAC 15, previously approved in paragraph (c)(95) of this section, and replaces them with the corresponding provisions of article 326 IAC 20-13.
