######## Applicability.

(a)You may request from the Administrator or State with an approved Title V program an extension of the compliance date of up to one year. An extension may be granted if you can reasonably document that the installation of pollution prevention or waste minimization measures will significantly reduce the amount and/or toxicity of hazardous wastes entering the feedstream(s) of the hazardous waste combustor(s), and that you could not install the necessary control measures and comply with the emission standards and operating requirements of this subpart by the compliance date.
