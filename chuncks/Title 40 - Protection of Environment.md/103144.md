(4) If the equation meets the criterion of&#x2264; 0.5% &#xB7;you may use the equation for the corresponding range of, as described in ยง 1065.642.

(5) If the equation does not meet the specified statistical criterion, you may use good engineering judgment to omit calibration data points; however you must use at least seven calibration data points to demonstrate that you meet the criterion. For example, this may involve narrowing the range of flow rates for a better curve fit.
