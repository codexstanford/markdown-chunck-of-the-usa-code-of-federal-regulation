2.4.2.1 Before DCM-extracts of dispersed oil-water samples can be analyzed for their oil content, the UV-visible spectrophotometer must meet an instrument stability calibration criterion. This criterion is determined with the six oil standards identified in table 3. Determine the absorbance of standards at each of the three analytical wavelengths (, 340, 370, and 400 nm). Determine the response factors (RFs) for the test oil at each of the three analytical wavelengths using the following equation:

2.4.2.2 Instrument stability for the initial calibration is acceptable when the RFs for the five highest standard extracts of oil are <20% different from the overall mean value for the five standards. If this criterion is satisfied, analysis of sample extracts can begin. RFs for the lowest concentration (0.05 mg oil/ml DCM) are not included in the consideration because the absorbance is close to the detection limit of the spectrophotometer (with associated high variability in the value) for the 1-cm path-length cell used for measurements. Absorbances â‰¥3.5 are not included because absorbance saturation occurs at and above this value.
