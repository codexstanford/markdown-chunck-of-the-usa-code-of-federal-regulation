######## 2,Set-points established with extrapolation.

()If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that will reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlates to the alarm set-point.

(E) You must include procedures for installation, operation, maintenance, and quality assurance of the PMDS in the site-specific continuous monitoring system test plan required under §§ 63.1207(e) and 63.8(e)(3);

(F) Where multiple detectors are required to monitor multiple control devices, the system's instrumentation and alarm system may be shared among the detectors.

(G) You must establish the alarm set-point as a 6-hour rolling average as provided by paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii), and (c)(9)(iv) of this section;

(H) Your PMDS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must update the 6-hour rolling average of the detector response each hour with a one-hour block average that is the average of the detector responses over each 15-minute block; and

(I) If you exceed the alarm set-point (or if your PMDS malfunctions), you must comply with the corrective measures under paragraph (c)(9)(vii) of this section.
