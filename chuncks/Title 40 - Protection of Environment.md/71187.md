###### How to get Reimbursed
####### ยง 310.13 Do I need to notify anyone while the response is underway?

No. You should notify EPA, the National Response Center, or use another established response communication channel, but it is not a requirement for reimbursement. Telephone numbers for EPA regional offices and the NRC are in appendix II to this part.
