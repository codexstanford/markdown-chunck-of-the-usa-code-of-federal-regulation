###### ยง 60.114b Alternative means of emission limitation.

(a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in ยง 60.112b, the Administrator will publish in thea notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.

(b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section will be published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

(c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to the Administrator a written application including:

(1) An actual emissions test that uses a full-sized or scale-model storage vessel that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions from a given control device and that accurately simulates wind and accounts for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure.

(2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is an accurate method of determining equivalence.

(d) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emissions reduction as specified in ยง 60.112b.
