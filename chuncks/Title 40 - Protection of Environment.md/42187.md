###### § 72.91 Phase I unit adjusted utilization.
####### Confirmation report.

(b)(1) If a unit's annual compliance certification report estimates any expected kilowatt hour savings or improvement in heat rate from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures under a reduced utilization plan, the designated representative shall submit, by July 1 of the year in which the annual report was submitted, a confirmation report. The Administrator may grant, for good cause shown, an extension of the time to file the confirmation report. The confirmation report shall include the following elements in a format prescribed by the Administrator:

(i) The verified kilowatt hour savings from each such energy conservation measure and the verified corresponding reduction in the unit's heat input resulting from each measure during the calendar year covered by the annual report. For purposes of this paragraph (b), all values in Kwh shall be converted to mmBtu using the actual annual heat rate (Btu/Kwh) of the unit (determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter) before the employment of any improved unit efficiency measures under an approved reduced utilization plan.

(ii) The verified reduction in the heat rate achieved by each improved unit efficiency measure and the verified corresponding reduction in the unit's heat input resulting from such measure.

(iii) For each figure under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section:

(A) Documentation (which may follow the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol) verifying specified figures to the satisfaction of the Administrator; or

(B) Certification, by a State utility regulatory authority that has ratemaking jurisdiction over the utility system that paid for the measures in accordance with § 72.43(b)(2) of this part and over rates reflecting any of the amount paid for such measures, or that meets the criteria in § 73.82(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this chapter, that such authority verified specified figures related to demand-side measures; and

(C) Certification, by a utility regulatory authority that has ratemaking jurisdiction over the utility system that paid for the measures in accordance with § 72.43(b)(2) of this part and over rates reflecting any of the amount paid for such measures, that such authority verified specified figures related to supply-side measures, except measures relating to generation efficiency.

(iv) The sum of the verified reductions in a unit's heat input from all measures implemented at the unit to reduce the unit's heat rate (whether the measures are treated as supply-side measures or improved unit efficiency measures) shall not exceed the generation (in kwh) attributed to the unit for the calendar year times the difference between the unit's heat rate for 1987 and the unit's heat rate for the calendar year.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, where two or more Phase I units include in the confirmation report the verified kilowatt hour savings or reduction in heat rate from the same specific conservation or improved unit efficiency measures:

(i) The designated representatives of all such units shall submit with their confirmation reports a certification signed by all such designated representatives. The certification shall apportion the total kilowatt hour savings or reduction in heat rate among such units.

(ii) Each designated representative shall include in the confirmation report only the respective unit's share of the total savings or reduction in heat rate in accordance with the certification under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

(3) If the total, included in the confirmation report, of the amounts of verified reduction in the unit's heat input from energy conservation and improved unit efficiency measures equals the total estimated in the unit's annual compliance certification report from such measures for the calendar year, then the designated representatives shall include in the confirmation report a statement indicating that is true.

(4) If the total, included in the confirmation report, of the amounts of verified reduction in the unit's heat input from energy conservation and improved unit efficiency measures is greater than the total estimated in the unit's annual compliance certification report from such measures for the calendar year, then the designated representative shall include in the confirmation report the number of allowances to be credited to the unit's compliance subaccount calculated using the following formula:

(i) "Verified heat input reduction" is the total of the amounts of verified reduction in the unit's heat input (in mmBtu) from energy conservation and improved unit efficiency measures included in the confirmation report.

(ii) "Estimated heat input reduction" is the total of the amounts of reduction in the unit's heat input (in mmBtu) accounted for by energy conservation and improved efficiency measures as estimated in the unit's annual compliance certification report for the calendar year.

(iii) "Emissions rate" is the "emissions rate" under § 72.92(c)(2)(v) of this part.

(iv) The allowances credited shall not exceed the total number of allowances deducted from the unit's compliance subaccount for the calendar year in accordance with §§ 72.92(a) and (c) and 73.35(b) of this chapter.

(5) If the total, included in the confirmation report, of the amount of verified reduction in the unit's heat input for energy conservation and improved unit efficiency measures is less than the total estimated in the unit's annual compliance certification report for such measures for the calendar year, then the designated representative shall include in the confirmation report the number of allowances to be deducted from the unit's compliance subaccount calculated in accordance with this paragraph (b)(5).

(i) If any allowances were deducted from the unit's compliance subaccount for the calendar year in accordance with §§ 72.92(a) and (c) and 73.35(b) of this chapter, then the number of allowances to be deducted under paragraph (b)(5) of this section equals the absolute value of the result of the formula for allowances credited under paragraph (b)(4) of this section (excluding paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section).

(ii) If no allowances were deducted from the unit's compliance subaccount for the calendar year in accordance with §§ 72.92(a) and (c) and 73.35(b) of this chapter:

(A) The designated representative shall recalculate the unit's adjusted utilization in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, replacing the amounts for reduction from energy conservation and reduction from improved unit efficiency by the amount for verified heat input reduction. "Verified heat input reduction" is the total of the amounts of verified reduction in the unit's heat input (in mmBtu) from energy conservation and improved unit efficiency measures included in the confirmation report.

(B) After recalculating the adjusted utilization under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section for all Phase I units that are in the unit's dispatch system and to which paragraph (b)(5) of this section is applicable, the designated representative shall calculate the number of allowances to be surrendered in accordance with § 72.92(c)(2) using the recalculated adjusted utilizations of such Phase I units.
