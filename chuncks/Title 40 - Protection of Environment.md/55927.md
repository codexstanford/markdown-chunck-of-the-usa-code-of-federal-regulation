####### Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration.,Giardia lamblia

(a)(1) For systems using conventional filtration or direct filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1), except that if the State determines that the system is capable of achieving at least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation ofcysts at some turbidity level higher than 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, the State may substitute this higher turbidity limit for that system. However, in no case may the State approve a turbidity limit that allows more than 1 NTU in more than 5 percent of the samples taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).

(2) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).

(3) Beginning January 1, 2002, systems serving at least 10,000 people must meet the turbidity requirements in § 141.173(a).

(4) Beginning January 1, 2005, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must meet the turbidity requirements in §§ 141.550 through 141.553.
