###### ยง 610.64 Track test procedures.
####### City fuel economy test.

(b)Although essentially the same procedures will be used for track testing as for dynamometer testing, some modifications will be necessary to insure safe operation of the test vehicle and to adjust to the requirements of track testing.

(1) An assistant to the driver will be necessary to steer the vehicle, so that the driver will not be distracted from following the speed-time schedules used in the Federal test procedure.

(2) The test vehicle will be preconditioned within the same time constraints given in ยง 610.43(a)(1)(ii). Preconditioning may take place either on the track or on a dynamometer. The 12-hour soak after preconditioning will take place in an area where the ambient temperature will remain within the 60&#xB0; to 90 &#xB0;F range, indoors, if necessary.

(3) The vehicle will be transported to the test track without being started. If the distance from soak area to track is no greater than one-quarter mile, then the vehicle may be pushed or towed to the track. Otherwise the vehicle must be transported by truck or trailer.

(4) Fuel economy will be determined by either a gravimetric or volumetric method.
