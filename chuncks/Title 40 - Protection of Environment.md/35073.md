####### ยง 63.4361 How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
######## Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.

(a)You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met.

(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.

(2) All regulated materials applied in the web coating/printing or dyeing/finishing operation are applied within the capture system; regulated material solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system; and the removal or evaporation of cleaning materials from the web coating/printing operation surfaces they are applied to occurs within the capture system. For example, this criterion is not met if the web enters the open shop environment when moving between the application station and a curing oven.
