####### VGT slow response.

(C)The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration in the capability of the VGT system on engines so equipped to achieve the commanded turbocharger geometry within a manufacturer-specified time that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the VGT system response could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction of the VGT system when proper functional response of the system to computer commands does not occur.
