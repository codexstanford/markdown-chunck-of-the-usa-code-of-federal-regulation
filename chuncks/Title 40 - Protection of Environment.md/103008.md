####### Optional declared speeds.

(3)You may use declared speeds instead of measured speeds as follows:

(i) You may use a declared value for maximum test speed for variable-speed engines if it is within (97.5 to 102.5) % of the corresponding measured value. You may use a higher declared speed if the length of the "vector" at the declared speed is within 2% of the length of the "vector" at the measured value. The term vector refers to the square root of the sum of normalized engine speed squared and the normalized full-load power (at that speed) squared, consistent with the calculations in ยง 1065.610.

(ii) You may use a declared value for intermediate, "A", "B", or "C" speeds for steady-state tests if the declared value is within (97.5 to 102.5)% of the corresponding measured value.

(iii) For electronically governed engines, you may use a declared warm high-idle speed for calculating the alternate maximum test speed as specified in ยง 1065.610.
