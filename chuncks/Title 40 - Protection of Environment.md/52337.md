###### § 98.174 Monitoring and QA/QC requirements.

(a) If you operate and maintain a CEMS that measures COemissions consistent with subpart C of this part, you must meet the monitoring and QA/QC requirements of § 98.34(c).

(b) If you determine COemissions using the carbon mass balance procedure in § 98.173(b)(1), you must:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, determine the mass of each process input and output other than fuels using the same plant instruments or procedures that are used for accounting purposes (such as weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, weighed purchased quantities in shipments or containers, combination of bulk density and volume measurements, etc.), record the totals for each process input and output for each calendar month, and sum the monthly mass to determine the annual mass for each process input and output. Determine the mass rate of fuels using the procedures for combustion units in § 98.34. No determination of the mass of steel output from decarburization vessels is required.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, determine the carbon content of each process input and output annually for use in the applicable equations in § 98.173(b)(1) based on analyses provided by the supplier or by the average carbon content determined by collecting and analyzing at least three samples each year using the standard methods specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section as applicable.
