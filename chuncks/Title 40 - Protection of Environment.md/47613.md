###### ยง 86.1805-17 Useful life.
####### Interim provisions.

(f)The useful life provisions of ยง 86.1805-12 apply for vehicles not yet subject to Tier 3 requirements. For example, vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR are not subject to the useful life provisions in this section until model year 2019 unless manufacturers voluntarily certify to the Tier 3 requirements earlier than the regulations require. Also, where the transition to Tier 3 standards involves a phase-in percentage for a given standard, vehicles not included as part of the phase-in portion of the fleet continue to be subject to the useful life provisions of ยง 86.1805-12 with respect to that standard. The useful life values for a set of vehicles may be different for exhaust and evaporative emission standards in 2021 and earlier model years; if vehicles have different useful life values for evaporative and exhaust emission standards, the evaporative useful life applies for the OBD requirements related to the leak standard and the exhaust useful life applies for all other OBD requirements.
