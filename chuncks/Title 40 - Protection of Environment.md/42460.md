####### i.e.,

(v) For the event of installation of a flue gas desulfurization system or add-on NOemission controls, quality-assured data recorded on the high measurement scale of the monitor that measures the pollutant being removed by the add-on emission controls (SOor NO, as applicable), if, pursuant to section 2 of appendix A to this part, two spans and ranges are required for that monitor and if the high measurement scale of the monitor has been certified according to ยง 75.20(c), section 6 of appendix A to this part, and, if applicable, paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Data recorded on the certified high scale that ordinarily would be required to be recorded on the low scale, pursuant to section 2.1.1.4(g) or 2.1.2.4(f) of appendix A to this part, may be reported as quality-assured for a period not to exceed 60 unit or stack operating days after the date and hour that reagent is first injected into the control device, after which one or more of the options provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(vi) of this section must be used to report SOor NOconcentration data (as applicable) for each operating hour in which these low emissions occur, until certification testing of the low scale of the monitor is successfully completed; or

(vi) Another procedure approved by the Administrator pursuant to a petition under ยง 75.66.

(3) If a particular project involves both the event of new stack or flue construction and the event of installation of a flue gas desulfurization system or add-on NOemission controls, the owner or operator shall either:

(i) Complete all of the monitoring system certification and/or recertification and/or diagnostic testing requirements of both events within the window of time provided under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section; or

(ii) Complete all of the monitoring system certification and/or recertification and/or diagnostic testing requirements of each event within the separate window of time applicable to such event provided under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(4) For the project described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the emissions data from each CEMS installed on the new stack recorded in the interval of time starting on the date and hour on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack and ending on the hour before the date and hour on which reagent is first injected into the control device may be reported as quality assured:
