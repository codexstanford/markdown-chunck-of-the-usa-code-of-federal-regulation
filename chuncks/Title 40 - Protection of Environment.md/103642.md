###### ยง 1066.105 Ambient controls and vehicle cooling fans.
####### Allowable cooling fans for vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR.

(d)For all testing, use a road-speed modulated fan system that achieves a linear speed of cooling air at the blower outlet that is within +/-3.0 mi/hr (+/-1.3 m/s) of the corresponding roll speed when vehicle speeds are between 5 and 30 mi/hr, and within +/-10 mi/hr (+/-4.5 m/s) of the corresponding roll speed at higher vehicle speeds. For vehicles above 19,500 pounds GVWR, we recommend that the cooling fan have a minimum opening of 2.75 m, a minimum flow rate of 60 m/s at a fan speed of 50 mi/hr, and a minimum speed profile in the free stream flow, across the duct that is +/-15% of the target flow rate.
