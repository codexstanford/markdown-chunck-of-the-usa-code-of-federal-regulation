(c)If you use multiple venturis and you calibrated each venturi independently to determine a separate calibration coefficient,for each venturi, calculate the individual volume flow rates through each venturi and sum all their flow rates to determine CFV flow rate,. If you use multiple venturis and you calibrated venturis in combination, calculateusing thethat was determined for that combination of venturis.
