####### Summary report.

(vi)As required under paragraphs (e)(3)(vii) and (e)(3)(viii) of this section, one summary report shall be submitted for the hazardous air pollutants monitored at each affected source (unless the relevant standard specifies that more than one summary report is required, e.g., one summary report for each hazardous air pollutant monitored). The summary report shall be entitled "Summary Report-Gaseous and Opacity Excess Emission and Continuous Monitoring System Performance" and shall contain the following information:

(A) The company name and address of the affected source;

(B) An identification of each hazardous air pollutant monitored at the affected source;

(C) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;

(D) A brief description of the process units;

(E) The emission and operating parameter limitations specified in the relevant standard(s);

(F) The monitoring equipment manufacturer(s) and model number(s);

(G) The date of the latest CMS certification or audit;

(H) The total operating time of the affected source during the reporting period;

(I) An emission data summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of excess emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes;

(J) A CMS performance summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total CMS downtime during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of CMS downtime expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total CMS downtime during the reporting period into periods that are due to monitoring equipment malfunctions, nonmonitoring equipment malfunctions, quality assurance/quality control calibrations, other known causes, and other unknown causes;

(K) A description of any changes in CMS, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;

(L) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and

(M) The date of the report.

(vii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is less than 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, and CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report shall be submitted, and the full excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report need not be submitted unless required by the Administrator.

(viii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, both the summary report and the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report shall be submitted.
