###### ยง 68.25 Worst-case release scenario analysis.

(a) The owner or operator shall analyze and report in the RMP:

(1) For Program 1 processes, one worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process;

(2) For Program 2 and 3 processes:

(i) One worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint provided in appendix A of this part resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes under worst-case conditions defined in ยง 68.22;

(ii) One worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint defined in ยง 68.22(a) resulting from an accidental release of regulated flammable substances from covered processes under worst-case conditions defined in ยง 68.22; and

(iii) Additional worst-case release scenarios for a hazard class if a worst-case release from another covered process at the stationary source potentially affects public receptors different from those potentially affected by the worst-case release scenario developed under paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
