##### Subpart A - Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices
###### ยง 257.3-5 Application to land used for the production of food-chain crops (interim final).
####### Provided,

(B) For soils with a background pH of less than 6.5, the cumulative cadmium application rate does not exceed the levels below:That the pH of the solid waste and soil mixture is adjusted to and maintained at 6.5 or greater whenever food-chain crops are grown.

(2)(i) The only food-chain crop produced is animal feed.

(ii) The pH of the solid waste and soil mixture is 6.5 or greater at the time of solid waste application or at the time the crop is planted, whichever occurs later, and this pH level is maintained whenever food-chain crops are grown.

(iii) There is a facility operating plan which demonstrates how the animal feed will be distributed to preclude ingestion by humans. The facility operating plan describes the measures to be taken to safeguard against possible health hazards from cadmium entering the food chain, which may result from alternative land uses.

(iv) Future property owners are notified by a stipulation in the land record or property deed which states that the property has received solid waste at high cadmium application rates and that food-chain crops should not be grown, due to a possible health hazard.
