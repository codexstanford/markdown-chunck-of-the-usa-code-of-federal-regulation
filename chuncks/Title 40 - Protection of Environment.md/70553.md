###### Calculation of ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence/ bioaccumulation factor value.

4.2.4.2.1.5Assign each hazardous substance an ecosystem toxicity/mobility factor value from table 3-9 (section 3.2.1.3), based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the ecosystem toxicity and mobility factors. Then assign each hazardous substance an ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value from table 4-29, based on the values assigned for the ecosystem toxicity/mobility and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance an ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from table 4-30, based on the values assigned for the ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factors. Select the substance with the highest ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed and use it to assign the value to this factor for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.
