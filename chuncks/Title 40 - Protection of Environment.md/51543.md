####### City gate

means a location at which natural gas ownership or control passes from one party to another, neither of which is the ultimate consumer. In this rule, in keeping with common practice, the term refers to a point or measuring station at which a local gas distribution utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system. Meters at the city gate station measure the flow of natural gas into the local distribution company system and typically are used to measure local distribution company system sendout to customers.
