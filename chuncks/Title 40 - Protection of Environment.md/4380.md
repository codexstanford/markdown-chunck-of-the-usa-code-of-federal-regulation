###### Sampler.

7.2The air sampler shall provide means for drawing the air sample, via reduced pressure, through the filter at a uniform face velocity.

7.2.1 The sampler shall have suitable means to:

a. Hold and seal the filter to the sampler housing.

b. Allow the filter to be changed conveniently.

c. Preclude leaks that would cause error in the measurement of the air volume passing through the filter.

d. (&#x2020;)Manually adjust the flow rate to accommodate variations in filter pressure drop and site line voltage and altitude. The adjustment may be accomplished by an automatic flow controller or by a manual flow adjustment device. Any manual adjustment device must be designed with positive detents or other means to avoid unintentional changes in the setting.
