###### § 84.11 Allocation of calendar-year consumption allowances.

(a) The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year consumption allowances to entities that imported or produced a bulk regulated substance in 2020, unless an individual accommodation is permitted by a relevant Agency official. If multiple importers are related through shared corporate or common ownership or control, the relevant agency official will calculate and issue allowances to a single corporate or common owner. The number of consumption allowances allocated to each eligible entity for 2022-2023 is calculated as follows:

(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted consumption amounts chosen at the corporate or common ownership level for eligible entities reporting to the agency for each calendar year 2011 through 2019;

(2) Sum the "average high year" values determined in step 1 of all eligible entities and determine each entity's percentage of that total;

(3) Determine the amount of general pool consumption allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 and the set-aside in § 84.15 from the consumption cap § 84.7(b)(3);

(4) Determine individual entity consumption allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in step 2 by the amount of general pool allowances determined in step 3.

(b)(1) EPA will allocate calendar year consumption allowances to individual entities by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used based on the exchange value-weighted quantities calculated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(2) EPA will provide public notice of the list of companies receiving consumption allowances as well as how they will be allocated by that date.

(c)(1) In addition to the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the relevant agency official will allocate calendar year consumption allowances to entities that qualified for allowances under § 84.15.

(2) If there are remaining consumption allowances after distribution from the set-aside under § 84.15, the relevant agency official will distribute such allowances on a pro rata basis to the entities in paragraph (a) of this section by March 31 of the calendar year.
