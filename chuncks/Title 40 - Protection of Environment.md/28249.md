###### § 63.804 Compliance procedures and monitoring requirements.
####### Continuous compliance demonstrations.

(g)(1) Owners or operators of an affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.802 (a)(1) or (b)(1) that comply through the procedures established in § 63.804 (a)(1) or (d)(1) shall demonstrate continuous compliance by submitting the results of the averaging calculation (Equation 1) for each month within that semiannual period and submitting a compliance certification with the semiannual report required by § 63.807(c).

(i) The compliance certification shall state that the value of (E), as calculated by Equation 1, is no greater than 1.0 for existing sources or 0.8 for new sources. An affected source is in violation of the standard if E is greater than 1.0 for existing sources or 0.8 for new sources for any month. A violation of the monthly average is a separate violation of the standard for each day of operation during the month, unless the affected source can demonstrate through records that the violation of the monthly average can be attributed to a particular day or days during the period.

(ii) The compliance certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the company that owns or operates the affected source.

(2) Owners or operators of an affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.802 (a)(1) or (b)(1) that comply through the procedures established in § 63.804 (a)(2) or (d)(2) shall demonstrate continuous compliance by using compliant coatings and thinners, maintaining records that demonstrate the coatings and thinners are compliant, and submitting a compliance certification with the semiannual report required by § 63.807(c).

(i) The compliance certification shall state that compliant stains, washcoats, sealers, topcoats, basecoats, enamels, and thinners, as applicable, have been used each day in the semiannual reporting period or should otherwise identify the periods of noncompliance and the reasons for noncompliance. An affected source is in violation of the standard whenever a noncompliant coating, as demonstrated by records or by a sample of the coating, is used.

(ii) The compliance certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the company that owns or operates the affected source.

(3) Owners or operators of an affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.802 (a)(1) or (b)(1) that are complying through the procedures established in § 63.804 (a)(2) or (d)(2) and are applying coatings using continuous coaters shall demonstrate continuous compliance by following the procedures in paragraph (g)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir and the VHAP content as calculated from records, using compliant thinners, and submitting a compliance certification with the semiannual report required by § 63.807(c).

(A) The compliance certification shall state that compliant coatings have been used each day in the semiannual reporting period, or should otherwise identify the days of noncompliance and the reasons for noncompliance. An affected source is in violation of the standard whenever a noncompliant coating, as determined by records or by a sample of the coating, is used. Use of a noncompliant coating is a separate violation for each day the noncompliant coating is used.

(B) The compliance certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the company that owns or operates the affected source.

(ii) Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir, using compliant thinners, maintaining a viscosity of the coating in the reservoir that is no less than the viscosity of the initial coating by monitoring the viscosity with a viscosity meter or by testing the viscosity of the initial coating and retesting the coating in the reservoir each time solvent is added, maintaining records of solvent additions, and submitting a compliance certification with the semiannual report required by § 63.807(c).

(A) The compliance certification shall state that compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir, have been used each day in the semiannual reporting period. Additionally, the certification shall state that the viscosity of the coating in the reservoir has not been less than the viscosity of the initial coating, that is, the coating that is initially mixed and placed in the reservoir, for any day in the semiannual reporting period.

(B) The compliance certification shall be signed by a responsible official of the company that owns or operates the affected source.

(C) An affected source is in violation of the standard when a sample of the as-applied coating exceeds the applicable limit established in § 63.804 (a)(2) or (d)(2), as determined using EPA Method 311, or the viscosity of the coating in the reservoir is less than the viscosity of the initial coating.

(4) Owners or operators of an affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.802 (a)(1) or (b)(1) that comply through the procedures established in § 63.804 (a)(3) or (d)(3) shall demonstrate continuous compliance by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating the appropriate monitoring equipment according to manufacturer's specifications.
