####### Methods for continuous measurement from manifolded groups of reciprocating compressor sources.

(5)If you elect to conduct continuous volumetric emission measurements for a manifolded group of compressor sources as specified in paragraph (p)(1)(iv) of this section, you must measure volumetric emissions as specified in paragraphs (p)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Measure at a single point in the manifold downstream of all compressor inputs and, if practical, prior to comingling with other non-compressor emission sources.

(ii) Continuously measure the volumetric flow for the manifolded group of compressor sources at standard conditions using a permanent meter according to methods set forth in ยง 98.234(b).

(iii) If compressor blowdown emissions are included in the metered emissions specified in paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section, the compressor blowdown emissions may be included with the reported emissions for the manifolded group of compressor sources and do not need to be calculated separately using the method specified in paragraph (i) of this section for blowdown vent stacks.
