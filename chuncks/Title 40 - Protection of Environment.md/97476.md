######## n-Octanol/water partition coefficient,n,n

(K) is defined as the ratio of the molar concentrations of a chemical in-octanol and water, in dilute solution. The coefficient Kis a constant for a given chemical at a given temperature. Since Kis the ratio of two molar concentrations, it is a dimensionless quantity. Sometimes Kis reported as the decadic logarithm (logK). In this equation, Cand Care the molar concentration of the solute in-octanol and water, respectively, at a given temperature. This test procedure determines Kat 25 +/-0.05 &#xB0;C. The mathematical statement of Kis:
