######## Computing fleet average NO

(f)emissions. (1) Manufacturers must separately compute these fleet NOaverages using the equation contained in paragraph (f)(2) of this section:

(i) Their Tier 2 LDV/LLDT and Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average NOemissions for each model year through 2008;

(ii) Their combined Tier 2 LDV/T and MDPV fleet average NOemissions for each model year after 2008;

(iii) Their interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDT fleet average NOemissions for each model year through 2006; and

(iv) Their interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average NOemissions for each model year through 2008.

(2) The equation for computing fleet average NOemissions is as follows:

(3) The results of the calculation in paragraph (f)(2) of this section must be rounded as required by § 86.1837-01.

(4) When approved in advance by the Administrator, the numerator in the equation in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may be adjusted downward by the product of the number of HEVs from each NOemission bin times a HEV NOcontribution factor determined through mathematical estimation of the reduction in NOemissions over the test procedure used to certify the HEVs. The reduction in NOemissions must be determined using good engineering judgement and reflect the relation in actual full useful life NOemissions to the full useful life NOstandards for the certification bin applicable to the vehicles. The Administrator may require that calculation of the HEV NOcontribution factor include vehicle parameters such as vehicle weight, portion of time during the test procedure that the HEV operates with zero exhaust emissions, zero emission range, NOemissions from fuel-fired heaters and NOemissions from electricity production and storage.
