####### Procedures to determine continuous compliance with the mass emission limit specified in ยง 63.1405(b)(2)(i).

(3)

(i) The daily emission rate, kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of product, shall be determined for each operating day using Equation 5 of this section:

(ii) The daily emission rate of organic HAP, in kilograms per day, from an individual continuous process vent (Ei) shall be determined. Once organic HAP emissions have been estimated, as specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for uncontrolled continuous process vents or paragraphs (h)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for continuous process vents vented to a control device or control technology, the owner or operator may use the estimated organic HAP emissions (Ei) until the estimated organic HAP emissions are no longer representative due to a process change or other reason known to the owner or operator. If organic HAP emissions (Ei) are determined to no longer be representative, the owner or operator shall redetermine organic HAP emissions for the continuous process vent following the procedures in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for uncontrolled continuous process vents or paragraphs (h)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for continuous process vents vented to a control device or control technology.

(A) For continuous process vents estimated through engineering assessment, as described in ยง 63.1414(d)(10), to emit less than 10 tons per year of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, the owner or operator may use the emissions determined using engineering assessment in Equation 5 of this section or may determine organic HAP emissions using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. For continuous process vents estimated through engineering assessment, as described in ยง 63.1414(d)(10), to emit 10 tons per year or greater of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, uncontrolled organic HAP emissions shall be estimated following the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

(B) For continuous process vents vented to a control device or control technology, controlled organic HAP emissions shall be determined as follows:
