The purpose of this subpart is to require air agencies to develop and submit air quality data characterizing maximum 1-hour ambient concentrations of SOacross the United States through either ambient air quality monitoring or air quality modeling analysis at the air agency's election. These monitoring and modeling data may be used in future determinations by the EPA regarding areas' SONAAQS attainment status, or for other actions designed to ensure attainment of the 2010 SONAAQS and provide protection to the public from the short-term health effects associated with exposure to SOconcentrations that exceed the NAAQS.
