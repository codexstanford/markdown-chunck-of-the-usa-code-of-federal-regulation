####### Erasing a permanent DTC.

(iii)The OBD system can erase a permanent DTC only if:

(A) The OBD system itself determines that the malfunction that caused the corresponding permanent DTC to be stored is no longer present and is not commanding activation of the MIL, concurrent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section which, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), shall apply to all monitors.

(B) All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle if the monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction of the component or the system is not present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present.

(C)(1) All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is not subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle provided the following two criteria have independently been satisfied:

(i) The monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction is no longer present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present; and,

(ii) The monitor does not detect a malfunction on a drive cycle and the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section has been met.
