####### e.g.,,e.g.,

(d) Characterize the ecological receptors (aquatic species, wildlife, and/or other biological resources) and their habitats that may be present in the discharge area and their exposure pathways. The characterization shall include, but is not limited to, those species that may be in sensitive life stages, transient or migratory species, breeding or breeding-related activities (embryo and larvae development), and threatened and/or endangered species that may be exposed to the oil that is not dispersed, the dispersed oil, and the dispersant alone. The responsible party shall also estimate an acute toxicity level of concern for the dispersed oil using available dose-response information relevant to potentially exposed species following a species sensitivity distribution.

(e) Immediately report to the OSC any:

(1) Deviation of more than 10 percent from the mean hourly dispersant use rate for subsurface application, based on the dispersant volume authorized for 24 hours use, and the reason for the deviation.

(2) Ecological receptors of environmental importance, and any other ecological receptors as identified by the OSC or the Natural Resource Trustees, including any threatened or endangered species that may be exposed based on dispersed plume trajectory modeling and level of concern information.

(f) Report daily to the OSC water sampling and data analyses collected in paragraph (b) of this section and include:

(1) For each application platform, the actual amount of dispersant used for each one-hour period and the total amount of dispersant used for the previous 24-hour reporting period.
