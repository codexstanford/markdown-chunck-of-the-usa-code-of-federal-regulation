###### i.e.,

8.3.1 The velocities of exhaust gases from positive pressure baghouses are often too low to measure accurately with the type S pitot tube specified in Method 2 (velocity head <1.3 mm HO (0.05 in. HO)). For these conditions, measure the gas flow rate at the fabric filter inlet following the procedures outlined in Method 2. Calculate the average gas velocity at the measurement site as shown in section 12.2 and use this average velocity in determining and maintaining isokinetic sampling rates.
