####### EGR slow response.

(C)The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to any failure or deterioration in the capability of the EGR system to achieve the commanded flow rate within a manufacturer-specified time that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). The OBD system must monitor both the capability of the EGR system to respond to a commanded increase in flow and the capability of the EGR system to respond to a commanded decrease in flow.
