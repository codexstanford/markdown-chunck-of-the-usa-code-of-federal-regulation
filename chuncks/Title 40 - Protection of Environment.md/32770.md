######## Test methods.

(c)The owner or operator must use the following methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits or standards:

(1) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses.

(2) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate.

(3) Method 3 for gas analysis.

(4) Method 4 for moisture content of the stack gas.

(5) Method 5 for the concentration of PM.

(6) Method 9 for visible emission observations.

(7) Method 23 for the concentration of D/F.

(8) Method 25A for the concentration of THC, as propane.

(9) Method 26A for the concentration of HCl and HF. Method 26 may also be used, except at sources where entrained water droplets are present in the emission stream. Where a lime-injected fabric filter is used as the control device to comply with the 90 percent reduction standard, the owner or operator must measure the fabric filter inlet concentration of HCl at a point before lime is introduced to the system.
