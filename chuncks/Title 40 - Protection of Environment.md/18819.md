() When more than one application method () is used on an individual surface coating operation, the owner or operator shall perform an analysis to determine an average transfer efficiency by the following equation where "n" is the total number of coatings used and "p" is the total number of application methods:

(D) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

(E) For each EDP prime coat operation, calculate the turnover ratio (R) by the following equation:

(ii) If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G), calculated on a calendar month basis, is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit specified in ยง 60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purpose of this subpart.

(2) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under ยง 60.392.

(i) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility as described under ยง 60.393(c)(1)(i).

(ii) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied solids emitted after the control device, by the following equation: N = G[1-FE]

(A) Determine the fraction of total VOC which is emitted by an affected facility that enters the control device by using the following equation where "n" is the total number of stacks entering the control device and "p" is the total number of stacks not connected to the control device:
