####### ยง 63.1512 Performance test/compliance demonstration requirements and procedures.
######## i.e.,

(iii) Assume an 80-percent capture efficiency for the furnace exhaust (multiply emissions measured at the furnace exhaust outlet by 1.25). If the source fails to demonstrate compliance using the 80-percent capture efficiency assumption, the owner or operator must re-test with a hood that meets the ACGIH Guidelines within 180 days, or petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, within 180 days that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.

(iv) The 80-percent capture efficiency assumption is not applicable in the event of testing conducted under an approved petition submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section.

(6) The installation of hooding that meets ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14) is considered impractical if any of the following conditions exist:

(i) Building or equipment obstructions (for example, wall, ceiling, roof, structural beams, utilities, overhead crane or other obstructions) are present such that the temporary hood cannot be located consistent with acceptable hood design and installation practices;

(ii) Space limitations or work area constraints exist such that the temporary hood cannot be supported or located to prevent interference with normal furnace operations or avoid unsafe working conditions for the furnace operator; or

(iii) Other obstructions and limitations subject to agreement of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources.

(7) Testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions may include, but are not limited to the following:

(i) Installing a hood that does not entirely meet ACGIH guidelines;

(ii) Using the building as an enclosure, and measuring emissions exhausted from the building if there are no other furnaces or other significant sources in the building of the pollutants to be measured;

(iii) Installing temporary baffles on those sides or top of furnace opening if it is practical to do so where they will not interfere with material handling or with the furnace door opening and closing;

(iv) Minimizing the time the furnace doors are open or the top is off;

(v) Delaying gaseous reactive fluxing until charging doors are closed and, for round top furnaces, until the top is on;

(vi) Agitating or stirring molten metal as soon as practicable after salt flux addition and closing doors as soon as possible after solid fluxing operations, including mixing and dross removal;

(vii) Keeping building doors and other openings closed to the greatest extent possible to minimize drafts that would divert emissions from being drawn into the furnace;

(viii) Maintaining burners on low-fire or pilot operation while the doors are open or the top is off;

(ix) Use of fans or other device to direct flow into a furnace when door is open; or

(x) Removing the furnace cover one time in order to add a smaller but representative charge and then replacing the cover.
