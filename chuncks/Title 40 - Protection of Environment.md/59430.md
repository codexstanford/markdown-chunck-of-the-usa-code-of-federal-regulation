####### How must a State inform EPA of revisions to its containment regulations?

(d)Any state that has received authorization to continue implementing its state containment regulations must inform EPA by letter signed by the designated State Lead Agency within 6 months of any revision to the State's containment regulations. EPA will inform the state by letter if it determines that the State's containment regulations are no longer adequate based on the revisions. The State's containment regulations will remain in effect, unless and until EPA sends the state a letter making this determination.
