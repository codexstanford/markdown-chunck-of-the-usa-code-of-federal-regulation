####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Capture and control efficiency monitoring.

(iii)Whenever a web coating line is operated, continuously monitor the operating parameters established in accordance with ยง 63.3350(e) and (f) to ensure capture and control efficiency.

(iv) If demonstrating compliance on the basis of organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied, organic HAP emission rate based on coating materials applied, or emission of less than the calculated allowable organic HAP, determine the mass of each coating material applied on the web coating line or group of web coating lines controlled by a common oxidizer during the month.

(v) If demonstrating compliance on the basis of organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied, organic HAP emission rate based on coating material applied, or emission of less than the calculated allowable organic HAP, determine the organic HAP content of each coating material as-applied during the month following the procedure in ยง 63.3360(c).

(vi) If demonstrating compliance on the basis of organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied or emission of less than the calculated allowable organic HAP, determine the coating solids content of each coating material applied during the month following the procedure in ยง 63.3360(d).

(2) Convert the information obtained under paragraph (q)(1) of this section into the units of the selected compliance option using the calculation procedures specified in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
