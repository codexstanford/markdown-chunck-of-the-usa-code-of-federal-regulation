(7) Usually the reference concentration of the zero gas,, is zero:= 0 µmol/mol. However, in some cases you might know thathas a non-zero concentration. For example, if you zero a COanalyzer using ambient air, you may use the default ambient air concentration of CO, which is 375 µmol/mol. In this case,= 375 µmol/mol. Note that when you zero an analyzer using a non-zero, you must set the analyzer to output the actualconcentration. For example, if= 375 µmol/mol, set the analyzer to output a value of 375 µmol/mol when the zero gas is flowing to the analyzer.
