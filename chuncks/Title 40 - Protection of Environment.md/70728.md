3.4.7.2Terminate the mysid test after 48 hours of incubation. To count the dead animals accurately, place the exposure vessels on a light table such that light passes through the bottom of the vessel. Most of the dead mysids will be on the bottom of the beaker and can readily be seen against the background of the light table. Also search the top of the liquid for mysids trapped there by surface tension. Exercise caution when determining death of the animals. Occasionally, an animal appears dead, but closer observation shows slight movement of an appendage or a periodic spasm of its entire body. For these tests, animals exhibiting any movement when touched with a pipette tip are considered alive. Account for all test animals to ensure accuracy sincemay disintegrate or be cannibalized by other mysids. Consider individuals not accounted for as dead. At the end of 48 hours of exposure, terminate the mysid assay and determine the LCvalues in accordance with the methods described in the guidelines (6).
