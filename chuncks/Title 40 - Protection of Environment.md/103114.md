###### ยง 1065.610 Duty cycle generation.
####### i.e.

(i) Zero-percent speed is the warm idle speed measured according to ยง 1065.510(b)(6) with CITT applied,, measured warm idle speed in drive.

(ii) If the cycle begins with a set of contiguous idle points (zero-percent speed, and zero-percent torque), leave the reference torques set to zero for this initial contiguous idle segment. This is to represent free idle operation with the transmission in neutral or park at the start of the transient duty cycle, after the engine is started. If the initial idle segment is longer than 24 seconds, change the reference torques for the remaining idle points in the initial contiguous idle segment to CITT (i.e., change idle points corresponding to 25 seconds to the end of the initial idle segment to CITT). This is to represent shifting the transmission to drive.

(iii) For all other idle points, change the reference torque to CITT. This is to represent the transmission operating in drive.
