###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### ยง 63.5170 How do I demonstrate compliance with the standards?
######## Solvent recovery system using performance test and continuous monitoring compliance demonstration.

(2)For each solvent recovery system used to control one or more coil coating stations for which you choose to comply by means of performance testing of capture efficiency, continuous emission monitoring of the control device, and continuous monitoring of a capture system operating parameter, each month of the 12-month compliance period you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(i) For each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system, monitor an operating parameter established in ยง 63.5150(a)(4) to ensure that capture system efficiency is maintained; and

(ii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those work stations served by each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system according to either paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section:

(A) In accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) and (e)(2)(v) through (viii) of this section if the work stations served by that capture system are only always-controlled coil coating stations; or

(B) In accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii), (e)(2)(v) through (vii), and (h) of this section if the work stations served by that capture system include one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controllable work stations.
