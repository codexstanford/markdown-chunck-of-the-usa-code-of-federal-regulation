####### Monitoring requirements.

(b)Monitoring requirements shall, at a minimum, include:

(1) Monitoring of the nature of injected fluids at time intervals sufficiently frequent to yield data representative of their characteristics;

(2) Observation of injection pressure, flow rate, and cumulative volume at least with the following frequencies:

(i) Weekly for produced fluid disposal operations;

(ii) Monthly for enhanced recovery operations;

(iii) Daily during the injection of liquid hydrocarbons and injection for withdrawal of stored hydrocarbons; and

(iv) Daily during the injection phase of cyclic steam operations

(3) A demonstration of mechanical integrity pursuant to ยง 146.8 at least once every five years during the life of the injection well;

(4) Maintenance of the results of all monitoring until the next permit review (see 40 CFR 144.52(a)(5)); and

(5) Hydrocarbon storage and enhanced recovery may be monitored on a field or project basis rather than on an individual well basis by manifold monitoring. Manifold monitoring may be used in cases of facilities consisting of more than one injection well, operating with a common manifold. Separate monitoring systems for each well are not required provided the owner/operator demonstrates that manifold monitoring is comparable to individual well monitoring.
