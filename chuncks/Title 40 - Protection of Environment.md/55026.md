####### Background conditions

(2)means the biological, chemical, and physical conditions of a water body, upstream from the point or non-point source discharge under consideration. Background sampling location in an enforcement action will be upstream from the point of discharge, but not upstream from other inflows. If several discharges to any water body exist, and an enforcement action is being taken for possible violations to the standards, background sampling will be undertaken immediately upstream from each discharge.
