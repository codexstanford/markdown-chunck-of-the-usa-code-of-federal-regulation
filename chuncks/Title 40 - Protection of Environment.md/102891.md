(iv) Switch the ozonator on and adjust the ozone generation rate so the NO measured by the analyzer is 20 percent ofor a value which would simulate the maximum concentration of NOexpected during testing, while maintaining at least 10 percent unreacted NO. This ensures that the ozonator is generating NOat the maximum concentration expected during testing. Record the concentration of NO by calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data from the analyzer and record this value as.
