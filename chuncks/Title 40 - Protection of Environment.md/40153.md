###### Continuous Static Sampling.

8.7.2Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell volumes of sample gas. Isolate the cell, collect the spectrum of the static sample and record the pressure. Before measuring the next sample, purge the cell with 10 more cell volumes of sample gas.

8.8 Sampling QA and Reporting

8.8.1 Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by filling the cell with N2. Measure the RMSD in each analytical region in this absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans used is sufficient to achieve the target MAU.

8.8.2 Assign a unique file name to each spectrum.

8.8.3 Store two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra on separate computer disks.

8.8.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, signal integration time), and the spectral file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.
