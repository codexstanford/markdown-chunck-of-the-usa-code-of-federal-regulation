11.2Various analytical programs are available for relating sample absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated concentrations shall be verified by analyzing residual baselines after mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full description of the data analysis and calculations is contained in the FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices). Correct the calculated concentrations in the sample spectra for differences in absorption path length and temperature between the reference and sample spectra using equation 6,
