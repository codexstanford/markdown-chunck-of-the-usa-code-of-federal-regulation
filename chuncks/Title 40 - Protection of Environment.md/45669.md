###### § 85.520 Exemption provisions for outside useful life vehicles/engines.

(a) You are exempted from the tampering prohibition with respect to outside useful life vehicles/engines if you properly document and notify EPA that the conversion system satisfies all the provisions in this section; you meet the labeling requirements in § 85.530 before you sell, import or otherwise facilitate the use of a clean alternative fuel conversion system; and you meet the applicable requirements in § 85.535. You may also meet the requirements under this section by complying with the provisions in § 85.515.

(b) Documenting and notifying EPA under this section includes the following provisions:

(1) You must notify us as described in this section.

(2) Conversion test groups, evaporative/refueling families, and conversion engine families may be the same as those allowed for the intermediate age vehicle/engine program in § 85.515(b)(1) and (2).

(3) You must use good engineering judgment to specify, use, and assemble fuel system components and other hardware and software that are properly designed and matched for the vehicles/engines in which they will be installed. Good engineering judgment also dictates that any testing or data used to satisfy demonstration requirements be generated at a quality laboratory that follows good laboratory practices and that is capable of performing official EPA emission tests.
