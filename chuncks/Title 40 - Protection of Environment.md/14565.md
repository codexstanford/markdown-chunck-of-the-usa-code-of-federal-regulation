####### Determination of Attainment.

(n)EPA has determined, as of September 14, 2011, that based on 2007 to 2009 ambient air quality data, the Cleveland-Akron, Columbus, Dayton-Springfield, and Steubenville-Weirton nonattainment areas have attained the 1997 annual PMNAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 52.1004(c), suspends the requirements for these areas to submit attainment demonstrations, associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as these areas continue to meet the 1997 annual PMNAAQS.
