###### ยง 180.482 Tebufenozide; tolerances for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide tebufenozide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only tebufenozide, 3,5-dimethylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(4-ethylbenzoyl)hydrazide, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide tebufenozide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tebufenozide, 3,5-dimethylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(4-ethylbenzoyl)hydrazide, and its metabolites, 3,5-dimethylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-((4-carboxymethyl)benzoyl)hydrazide, 3-hydroxymethyl-5-methylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(4-ethylbenzoyl)hydrazide, stearic acid conjugate of 3-hydroxymethyl-5-methylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(4-ethylbenzoyl)hydrazide, and 3-hydroxymethyl-5-methylbenzoic acid 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(4-(1-hydroxyethyl)benzoyl)hydrazide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tebufenozide, in or on the commodity.
