6.1 By sampling in a controlled temperature environment of 15&#xB0; +/-10 &#xB0;C, greater than 98.9 percent of the SO-TCM complex is retained at the completion of sampling. () If kept at 5 &#xB0;C following the completion of sampling, the collected sample has been found to be stable for up to 30 days. () The presence of EDTA enhances the stability of SOin the TCM solution and the rate of decay is independent of the concentration of SO. ()
