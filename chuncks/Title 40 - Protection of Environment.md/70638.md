###### Calculation of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score.

5.3Sum the soil exposure component score and subsurface intrusion component score. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 100, as the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score (S). Enter this score in Table 5-11.

Evaluate the air migration pathway based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 6-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category.

Determine the air migration pathway score (S) in terms of the factor category values as follows:

Table 6-1 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
