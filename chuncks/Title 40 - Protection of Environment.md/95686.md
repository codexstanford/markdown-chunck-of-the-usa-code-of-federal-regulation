###### ยง 796.3500 Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25 &#xB0;C.
####### Procedure 3.

(iii)(A) If chemical hydrolysis is less than 20 percent after 672 hours, determine the concentration (C) after this time period.

(B) If the pH at the end of concentration measurements employing any of the above three procedures has changed by more than 0.05 units from the initial pH, repeat the experiment using a solution having a test chemical concentration lowered sufficiently to keep the pH variation within 0.05 pH units.
