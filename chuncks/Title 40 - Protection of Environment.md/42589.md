####### Disapproval notice.

(iii)If the certification (or recertification) application shows that any continuous emission or opacity monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of this part, or if the certification (or recertification) application is incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section has been met, the Administrator shall issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification (or recertification) application within 120 days of receipt. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the provisional certification (or recertification) is invalidated by the Administrator, and the data measured and recorded by each uncertified continuous emission or opacity monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data as follows: from the hour of the probationary calibration error test that began the initial certification (or recertification) test period (if the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section were used to retrospectively validate data); or from the date and time of completion of the invalid certification or recertification tests (if the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section were not used). The owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of initial certification in paragraph (a)(5) of this section for each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system which is disapproved for initial certification. For each disapproved recertification, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
