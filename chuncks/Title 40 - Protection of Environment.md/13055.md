(110) On November 21, 1995, and February 14, 1996, Indiana submitted Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Landfill rules for Clark, Floyd, Lake, and Porter Counties as a revision to the State Implementation Plan. This rule requires MSW landfills that emit greater than fifty-five tons per day of non-methane organic compound, or that have a minimum design capacity of one hundred eleven thousand tons (one hundred thousand megagrams) of solid waste, to install a landfill gas collection and control system that either incinerates the gas or recovers the gas for energy use.
