####### ยง 1065.220 Fuel flow meter.
######## Component requirements.

(b)We recommend that you use a fuel flow meter that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. We recommend a fuel flow meter that measures mass directly, such as one that relies on gravimetric or inertial measurement principles. This may involve using a meter with one or more scales for weighing fuel or using a Coriolis meter. Note that your overall system for measuring fuel flow must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307 and the calibration and verifications in ยง 1065.320.
