####### Vehicle tailpipe to CVS duct.

(2)For methanol fueled vehicles, cooling of the exhaust gases in the duct connecting the vehicle tailpipe to the CVS shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:

(i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 121 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F); heating and possibly cooling capabilities are required; or

(ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections, maintained at a temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 121 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F), prior to the test and during any breaks in the test and uninsulated during the test (insulation may remain in place and/or heating may occur during testing provided maximum temperature is not exceeded); or

(iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no required heating. A maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed under this option; or

(iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution function at the motorcycle tailpipe exit.
