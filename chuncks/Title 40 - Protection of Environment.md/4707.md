###### i.e.
####### EDXRF Pb Measurement Range.

2.1The typical ambient air measurement range is 0.001 to 30 µg Pb/m, assuming an upper range calibration standard of about 60 µg Pb per square centimeter (cm), a filter deposit area of 11.86 cm, and an air volume of 24 m. The top range of the EDXRF instrument is much greater than what is stated here. The top measurement range of quantification is defined by the level of the high concentration calibration standard used and can be increased to expand the measurement range as needed.
