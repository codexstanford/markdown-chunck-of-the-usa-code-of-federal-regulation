(2) When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether the annual average weight percent organic HAP in the stored liquid is above or below 4 percent for a storage vessel at an existing source or above or below 2 percent for a storage vessel at a new source, an appropriate method (based on the type of liquid stored) as published by EPA or a consensus-based standards organization shall be used. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373,), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293-8020,), the American Gas Association (AGA, 400 North Capitol Street NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 824-7000,), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763,), the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1220 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005-4070, (202) 682-8000,), and the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB, 801 Travis Street, Suite 1675, Houston, TX 77002, (713) 356-0060,).

(b) A floating roof storage vessel complying with the requirements of subpart WW of this part may comply with the control option specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and, if equipped with a ladder having at least one slotted leg, shall comply with one of the control options as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the floating roof storage vessel does not meet the requirements of § 63.1063(a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(viii) as of June 30, 2014, these requirements do not apply until the next time the vessel is completely emptied and degassed, or January 30, 2026, whichever occurs first.

(1) In addition to the options presented in §§ 63.1063(a)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) and 63.1064, a floating roof storage vessel may comply with § 63.1063(a)(2)(viii) using a flexible enclosure device and either a gasketed or welded cap on the top of the guidepole.

(2) Each opening through a floating roof for a ladder having at least one slotted leg shall be equipped with one of the configurations specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) A pole float in the slotted leg and pole wipers for both legs. The wiper or seal of the pole float must be at or above the height of the pole wiper.

(ii) A ladder sleeve and pole wipers for both legs of the ladder.

(iii) A flexible enclosure device and either a gasketed or welded cap on the top of the slotted leg.

(c) For the purposes of this subpart, references shall apply as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.

(1) All references to "the proposal date for a referencing subpart" and "the proposal date of the referencing subpart" in subpart WW of this part mean June 30, 2014.

(2) All references to "promulgation of the referencing subpart" and "the promulgation date of the referencing subpart" in subpart WW of this part mean February 1, 2016.

(3) All references to "promulgation date of standards for an affected source or affected facility under a referencing subpart" in subpart SS of this part mean February 1, 2016.

(4) All references to "the proposal date of the relevant standard established pursuant to CAA section 112(f)" in subpart SS of this part mean June 30, 2014.

(5) All references to "the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to CAA section 112(d)" in subpart SS of this part mean July 14, 1994.

(6) All references to the "required control efficiency" in subpart SS of this part mean reduction of organic HAP emissions by 95 percent or to an outlet concentration of 20 ppmv.

(d) For an uncontrolled fixed roof storage vessel that commenced construction on or before June 30, 2014, and that meets the definition of "Group 1 storage vessel", paragraph (2), in § 63.641 but not the definition of "Group 1 storage vessel", paragraph (1), in § 63.641, the requirements of § 63.982 and/or § 63.1062 do not apply until the next time the storage vessel is completely emptied and degassed, or January 30, 2026, whichever occurs first.
