####### Procedures for requesting a waiver.

(a)(1) A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing at the time the application is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b).

(2) A payment of $1,200 for processing the waiver or the amount of the actual fee, whichever is less, must be submitted simultaneously to the address set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. This fee will be refunded (or applied to any resulting partial fee) if the waiver is granted. Payment of fees for the registration activities, in contrast to the waiver fee, shall not be required until the Agency makes a determination on the waiver request. Since the actual fee is submitted to an address different than the one to which the waiver request is submitted, a copy of the payment document must be submitted with the waiver request that is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. No fee is required from a person who has no financial interest in the application.
