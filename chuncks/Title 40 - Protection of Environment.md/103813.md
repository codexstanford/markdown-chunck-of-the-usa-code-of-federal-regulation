(g) This paragraph (g) describes how to correct flow and flow rates to standard reference conditions and provides an example for determiningbased on CVS total flow and the removal of sample flow from the dilute exhaust gas. You may use predetermined nominal values for removed sample volumes, except for flows used for batch sampling.

(1) Correct flow and flow rates to standard reference conditions as needed using the following equation:
