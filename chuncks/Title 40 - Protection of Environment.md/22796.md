12.6.2 When Method 26A (or if approved for use, Method 26), found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 of this part, is used as the RM, compare each CEMS integrated average value against the corresponding RM value for identical test periods. Make these comparisons on the same basis (wet, dry, ppmv, or units of the standard). To convert results generate by Method 26A or 26 in mg/DSCM to ppmv, use the conversion factor 0.662 ppm/(mg/DSCM).

12.6.3 If the RM is Method 320 or Method 321, found in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or ASTM D6348-12, make a direct comparison of the average RM results and CEMS average value for identical test periods.

12.6.4 For each test run, calculate the arithmetic difference of the RM and CEMS results using Equation 9.
