(ii)In each model year manufacturers must comply with the COexhaust emission standard for their light truck fleet, calculated for that model year as follows:

(A) A COtarget value shall be determined according to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section for each unique combination of model type and footprint value.

(B) Each COtarget value, which represents a unique combination of model type and footprint value, shall be multiplied by the total production of that model type/footprint combination for the appropriate model year.

(C) The resulting products shall be summed, and that sum shall be divided by the total production of light trucks in that model year. The result shall be rounded to the nearest whole gram per mile. This result shall be the applicable fleet average COstandard for the manufacturer's light truck fleet.
