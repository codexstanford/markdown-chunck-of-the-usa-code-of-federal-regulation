####### Time to reach closed-loop/feedback enable temperature.

(B)The OBD system must detect if, within the manufacturer specified time interval following engine start, the ECT sensor does not achieve the highest stabilized minimum temperature that is needed to initiate closed-loop/feedback control of all affected emission control systems (e.g., fuel system, EGR system). The manufacturer specified time interval must be a function of the engine coolant temperature and/or intake air temperature at startup. The manufacturer time interval must be supported by data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating that it provides robust monitoring and minimizes the likelihood of other OBD monitors being disabled. The manufacturer may forego the requirements of this paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(B) provided the manufacturer does not use engine coolant temperature or the ECT sensor to enable closed-loop/feedback control of any emission control systems.
