(b) Pb-TSP and Pb-PMmeasurement data are reported to AQS in units of micrograms per cubic meter (Âµg/m) at local conditions (local temperature and pressure, LC) to three decimal places; any additional digits to the right of the third decimal place are truncated. Pre-rule Pb-TSP and Pb-PMconcentration data that were reported in standard conditions (standard temperature and standard pressure, STP) will not require a conversion to local conditions but rather, after truncating to three decimal places and processing as stated in this appendix, shall be compared "as is" to the NAAQS (, the LC to STP conversion factor will be assumed to be one). However, if the monitoring agency has retroactively resubmitted Pb-TSP or Pb-PMpre-rule data converted from STP to LC based on suitable meteorological data, only the LC data will be used.
