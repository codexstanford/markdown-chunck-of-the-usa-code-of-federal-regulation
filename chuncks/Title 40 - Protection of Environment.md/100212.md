The coastdown procedures in this section describe how to calculate drag area,, for Phase 2 tractors, trailers, and vocational vehicles, subject to the provisions of §§ 1037.525 through 1037.527. These procedures are considered the reference method for tractors, but an alternate method for trailers. Follow the provisions of Sections 1 through 9 of SAE J2263 (incorporated by reference in § 1037.810), with the clarifications and exceptions described in this section. Several of these exceptions are from SAE J1263 (incorporated by reference in § 1037.810). The coastdown procedures in 40 CFR 1066.310 apply instead of the provisions of this section for Phase 1 tractors.

(a) The terms and variables identified in this section have the meaning given in SAE J1263 and SAE J2263 unless specified otherwise.
