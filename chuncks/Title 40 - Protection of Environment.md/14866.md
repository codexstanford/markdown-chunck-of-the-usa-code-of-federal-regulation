(a) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP on October 6, 1994. These revisions address the requirements necessary to change a lead nonattainment area to attainment. The maintenance plan for the Fayette County area near Rossville, Tennessee is comprised of a maintenance demonstration and NSR/PSD program. For areas where the only lead source has shut down, these components are sufficient for an approvable maintenance plan. The State's maintenance plan is complete and satisfies all of the requirements of section 175(A) of the CAA.
