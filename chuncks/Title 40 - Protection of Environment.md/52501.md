####### EOR hydrocarbon liquids dissolved CO

(x). Calculate COemissions downstream of the storage tank from dissolved COin hydrocarbon liquids produced through EOR operations as follows:

(1) Determine the amount of COretained in hydrocarbon liquids after flashing in tankage at STP conditions. Annual samples of hydrocarbon liquids downstream of the storage tank must be taken according to methods set forth in ยง 98.234(b) to determine retention of COin hydrocarbon liquids immediately downstream of the storage tank. Use the annual analysis for the calendar year.

(2) Estimate emissions using Equation W-38 of this section.
