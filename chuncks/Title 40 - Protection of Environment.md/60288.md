####### tolerance with regional registration

(l) The termmeans any tolerance which is established for pesticide residues resulting from the use of the pesticide pursuant to a regional registration. Such a tolerance is supported by residue data from specific growing regions for a raw agricultural commodity. Individual tolerances with regional registration are designated in separate subsections in 40 CFR 180.101 through 180.999, as appropriate. Additional residue data which are representative of the proposed use area are required to expand the geographical area of usage of a pesticide on a raw agricultural commodity having an established "tolerance with regional registration." Persons seeking geographically broader registration of a crop having a "tolerance with regional registration" should contact the appropriate EPA product manager concerning additional residue data required to expand the use area.
