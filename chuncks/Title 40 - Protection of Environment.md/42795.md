###### § 75.64 Quarterly reports.
####### i.e.

(A) The applicable data elements under § 75.59(a)(7)(ii)(A) through (T) and under § 75.59(a)(7)(iii)(A) through (M) shall be reported for flow RATAs at circular or rectangular stacks (or ducts) in which angular compensation for yaw and/or pitch angles is used (, Method 2F or 2G in appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter), with or without wall effects adjustments;

(B) The applicable data elements under § 75.59(a)(7)(ii)(A) through (T) and under § 75.59(a)(7)(iii)(A) through (M) shall be reported for any flow RATA run at a circular stack in which Method 2 in appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter is used and a wall effects adjustment factor is determined by direct measurement;

(C) The data under § 75.59(a)(7)(ii)(T) shall be reported for all flow RATAs at circular stacks in which Method 2 in appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter is used and a default wall effects adjustment factor is applied; and

(D) The data under § 75.59(a)(7)(ix)(A) through (F) shall be reported for all flow RATAs at rectangular stacks or ducts in which Method 2 in appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter is used and a wall effects adjustment factor is applied.

(3) Facility identification information, including:

(i) Facility/ORISPL number;

(ii) Calendar quarter and year for the data contained in the report; and

(iii) Version of the electronic data reporting format used for the report.

(4) In accordance with § 75.62(a)(1), if any monitoring plan information required in § 75.53 requires an update, either under § 75.53(b) or elsewhere in this part, submission of the electronic monitoring plan update shall be completed prior to or concurrent with the submittal of the quarterly electronic data report for the appropriate quarter in which the update is required.

(5) The daily calibration error test and daily interference check information required in § 75.59(a)(1) and (a)(2) must always be included in the electronic quarterly emissions report. All other certification, quality assurance, and quality control information in § 75.59 that is not excluded from electronic reporting under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(7) of this section shall be submitted separately, either prior to or concurrent with the submittal of the relevant electronic quarterly emissions report. However, reporting of the information in § 75.59(a)(9)(x) is not required until September 26, 2011, and reporting of the information in § 75.59(a)(15), (b)(6), and (d)(4) is not required until March 27, 2012.

(6) The information and hourly data required in §§ 75.57 through 75.59, and daily calibration error test data, daily interference check, and off-line calibration demonstration information required in § 75.59(a)(1) and (2).

(7) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(6) of this section, the following information is excluded from electronic reporting:

(i) Descriptions of adjustments, corrective action, and maintenance;

(ii) Information which is incompatible with electronic reporting (e.g., field data sheets, lab analyses, quality control plan);

(iii) Opacity data listed in § 75.57(f), and in § 75.59(a)(8);

(iv) For units with SOor NOadd-on emission controls that do not elect to use the approved site-specific parametric monitoring procedures for calculation of substitute data, the information in § 75.58(b)(3);

(v) Information required by § 75.57(h) concerning the causes of any missing data periods and the actions taken to cure such causes;

(vi) Hardcopy monitoring plan information required by § 75.53 and hardcopy test data and results required by § 75.59;

(vii) Records of flow monitor and moisture monitoring system polynomial equations, coefficients, or "K" factors required by § 75.59(a)(5)(vi) or § 75.59(a)(5)(vii);

(viii) Daily fuel sampling information required by § 75.58(c)(3)(i) for units using assumed values under appendix D of this part;

(ix) Information required by §§ 75.59(b)(1)(vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), and (xiii), and (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) concerning fuel flowmeter accuracy tests and transmitter/transducer accuracy tests;

(x) Stratification test results required as part of the RATA supplementary records under § 75.59(a)(7);

(xi) Data and results of RATAs that are aborted or invalidated due to problems with the reference method or operational problems with the unit and data and results of linearity checks that are aborted or invalidated due to problems unrelated to monitor performance;

(xii) Supplementary RATA information required under § 75.59(a)(7)(i) through § 75.59(a)(7)(v), except that:
