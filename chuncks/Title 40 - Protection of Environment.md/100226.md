(6) For tractor testing, calculate the tire rolling resistance force at high and low speeds for steer, drive, and trailer axle positions,, and determine, the rolling resistance difference between 65 mi/hr and 15 mi/hr, for each tire as follows:

(i) Conduct a stepwise coastdown tire rolling resistance test with three tires for each tire model installed on the vehicle using SAE J2452 (incorporated by reference in § 1037.810) for the following test points (which replace the test points in Table 3 of SAE J2452):

(ii) Calculate FTRR[speed,axle] using the following equation:
