4.1 The precision of PMsamplers must be 5 µg/mfor PMconcentrations below 80 µg/mand 7 percent for PMconcentrations above 80 µg/m, as required by part 53 of this chapter, which prescribes a test procedure that determines the variation in the PMconcentration measurements of identical samplers under typical sampling conditions. Continual assessment of precision via collocated samplers is required by part 58 of this chapter for PMsamplers used in certain monitoring networks.
