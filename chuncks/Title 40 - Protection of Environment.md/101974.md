###### ยง 1051.801 What definitions apply to this part?
####### All-terrain vehicle

means a land-based or amphibious nonroad vehicle that meets the criteria listed in paragraph (1) of this definition; or, alternatively the criteria of paragraph (2) of this definition but not the criteria of paragraph (3) of this definition:

(1) Vehicles designed to travel on four low pressure tires, having a seat designed to be straddled by the operator and handlebars for steering controls, and intended for use by a single operator and no other passengers are all-terrain vehicles.

(2) Other all-terrain vehicles have three or more wheels and one or more seats, are designed for operation over rough terrain, are intended primarily for transportation, and have a maximum vehicle speed higher than 25 miles per hour. Golf carts generally do not meet these criteria since they are generally not designed for operation over rough terrain.

(3) Vehicles that meet the definition of "offroad utility vehicle" in this section are not all-terrain vehicles. However, ยง 1051.1(a) specifies that some offroad utility vehicles are required to meet the same requirements as all-terrain vehicles.
