#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart EEE - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Hazardous Waste Combustors
###### Interim Emissions Standards and Operating Limits For Incinerators, Cement Kilns, and Lightweight Aggregate Kilns
####### § 63.1203 What are the standards for hazardous waste incinerators that are effective until compliance with the standards under § 63.1219?
######## Emission limits for new sources.

(b)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

(1) Dioxins and furans in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(2) Mercury in excess of 45 µg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 120 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(4) Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium in excess of 97 µg/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:

(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 21 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and

(7) Particulate matter in excess of 34 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
