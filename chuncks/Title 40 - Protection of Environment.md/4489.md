###### Principle.,10

2.1Atmospheres containing accurately known concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are generated by means of a permeation device. () The permeation device emits NOat a known constant rate provided the temperature of the device is held constant (+/-0.1 &#xB0;C) and the device has been accurately calibrated at the temperature of use. The NOemitted from the device is diluted with zero air to produce NOconcentrations suitable for calibration of the NOchannel of the NO/NO/NOanalyzer. An NO concentration standard is used for calibration of the NO and NOchannels of the analyzer.
