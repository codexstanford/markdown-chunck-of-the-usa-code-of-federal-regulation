() The initial appendix E testing may be performed at a single load, between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load defined in the monitoring plan for the unit, if the average annual capacity factor of the LME unit, when calculated according to the definition of "capacity factor" in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, is 2.5 percent or less for the three calendar years immediately preceding the year of the testing, and that the annual capacity factor does not exceed 4.0 percent in any of those three years. Similarly, for a LME unit that reports emissions data on an ozone season-only basis, the initial appendix E testing may be performed at a single load between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load if the 2.5 and 4.0 percent capacity factor requirements are met for the three ozone seasons immediately preceding the date of the emission testing (see ยง 75.74(c)(11)). For a group of identical LME units, any unit(s) in the group that meet the 2.5 and 4.0 percent capacity factor requirements may perform the initial appendix E testing at a single load between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load.
