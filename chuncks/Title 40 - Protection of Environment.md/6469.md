###### Initial D,for cyclone IV.

12.3.1.2Determine the initial estimate for cyclone IV Dusing the test condition Reynolds number calculated with Equation 10 as indicated in Table 3 of Section 17. Refer to the following instructions.

(a) If the Reynolds number is less than 3,162, calculate the Dfor cyclone IV with Equation 34, using actual test data.

(b) If the Reynolds number is greater than or equal to 3,162, calculate the Dfor cyclone IV with Equation 35 using actual test data.

(c) Insert the "new" Dvalue calculated by either Equation 34 or 35 into Equation 36 to re-establish the Cunningham Correction Factor (C). (Use the test condition calculated Reynolds number to determine the most appropriate equation (Equation 34 or 35).)
