###### General.

Applicants must complete this Schedule and its supporting schedules if they seek a permanent waiver from interim control requirements. The applicant should complete Schedule D.6 twice, with revenue and production projections based on two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SOcontrols that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure after January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant control equipment and any additional SOcontrols required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so that the smelter will remain open through the horizon period. Forecasts in Schedule D.6 shall be compatible with assumptions and forecasts in each set of Schedules D.1 through D.4. The line items in Schedule D.6 are explained in the following instructions.
