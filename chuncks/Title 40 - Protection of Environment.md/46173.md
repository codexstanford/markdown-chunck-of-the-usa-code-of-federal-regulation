####### Engine misfire monitoring conditions.

(iii)(A) The OBD system must monitor continuously for misfire under the following conditions: from no later than the end of the second crankshaft revolution after engine start; during the rise time and settling time for engine speed to reach the desired idle engine speed at engine start-up (i.e., "flare-up" and "flare-down"); and, under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within the engine operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the points represented by an engine speed of 3000 rpm with the engine load at the positive torque line and the redline engine speed with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of mercury lower than that at the positive torque line. For this purpose, redline engine speed is defined as either the recommended maximum engine speed as displayed on the instrument panel tachometer, or the engine speed at which fuel shutoff occurs.

(B) If an OBD monitor cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions as required by paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the OBD system may still be acceptable. The Administrator will evaluate the following factors in making a determination: The magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under the required conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be based on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.

(C) The manufacturer may use monitoring system that has reduced misfire detection capability during the portion of the first 1000 revolutions after engine start that a cold start emission reduction strategy is active that reduces engine torque (e.g., spark retard strategies). To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the probability of detection is greater than or equal to 75 percent during the worst case condition (i.e., lowest generated torque) for a vehicle operated continuously at idle (park/neutral idle) on a cold start between 50 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit and that the technology cannot reliably detect a higher percentage of the misfire events during the conditions.

(D) The manufacturer may disable misfire monitoring or use an alternative malfunction criterion when misfire cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the disablement interval or the period of use of an alternative malfunction criterion is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection and for one or more of the following operating conditions: Rough road; fuel cut; gear changes for manual transmission vehicles; traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as anti-lock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle stability; off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or monitors during service or assembly plant testing; portions of intrusive evaporative system or EGR monitors that can significantly affect engine stability (i.e., while the purge valve is open during the vacuum pull-down of an evaporative system leak check but not while the purge valve is closed and the evaporative system is sealed or while an EGR monitor causes the EGR valve to be cycled intrusively on and off during positive torque conditions); or, engine speed, load, or torque transients due to throttle movements more rapid than those that occur over the FTP cycle for the worst case engine within each engine family. In general, the Administrator will not approve disablement for conditions involving normal air conditioning compressor cycling from on-to-off or off-to-on, automatic transmission gear shifts (except for shifts occurring during wide open throttle operation), transitions from idle to off-idle, normal engine speed or load changes that occur during the engine speed rise time and settling time (i.e., "flare-up" and "flare-down") immediately after engine starting without any vehicle operator-induced actions (e.g., throttle stabs), or excess acceleration (except for acceleration rates that exceed the maximum acceleration rate obtainable at wide open throttle while the vehicle is in gear due to abnormal conditions such as slipping of a clutch). The Administrator may approve misfire monitoring disablement or use of an alternate malfunction criterion for any other condition on a case by case basis upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the request is based on an unusual or unforeseen circumstance and that it is applying the best available computer and monitoring technology.

(E) For engines with more than eight cylinders that cannot meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may use alternative misfire monitoring conditions. Such use must be based on data and/or an engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer that demonstrate that misfire detection throughout the required operating region cannot be achieved when employing proven monitoring technology (i.e., a technology that provides for compliance with these requirements on other engines) and provided misfire is detected to the fullest extent permitted by the technology. However, the misfire detection system must still monitor during all positive torque operating conditions encountered during an FTP cycle.
