####### Low temperature ashing

2.7.2.1.2-For materials shown by PLM to contain large amounts of gypsum, cellulosic, or other organic materials, it may be desirable to ash the samples prior to analysis to reduce background radiation or matrix interference. Since chrysotile undergoes dehydroxylation at temperatures between 550 &#xB0;C and 650 &#xB0;C, with subsequent transformation to forsterite,ashing temperatures should be kept below 500 &#xB0;C. Use of a low temperature asher is recommended. In all cases, calibration of the oven is essential to ensure that a maximum ashing temperature of 500 &#xB0;C is not exceeded.
