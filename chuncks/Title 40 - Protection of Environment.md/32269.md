####### Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions.

(d)Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for individual reactor batch process vents or individual non-reactor batch process vents shall be determined using the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8) of this section. To estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Engineering assessment may be used to estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emission episode only under the conditions described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section, individual component vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (d)(9) of this section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section; through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section; by process knowledge; or by any other appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables shall be documented as specified in ยง 63.1417. Once organic HAP emissions for the batch emission episode have been determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct measurement, or engineering assessment, organic HAP emissions from a single batch cycle shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this section, and annual organic HAP emissions from the batch process vent shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
