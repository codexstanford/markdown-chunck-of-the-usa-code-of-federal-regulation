###### Flow meter.

12.2.1An accurate mass flow meter is accurate to +/-1 percent of its span. If a flow of 1 L/min is monitored with such a MFM, which is calibrated in the range of 0-5 L/min, the flow measurement has an uncertainty of 5 percent. This may be improved by re-calibrating the meter at the specific flow rate to be used.
