####### i.e.

(C) Except for peaking units, identify the most frequently and second most frequently used load (or operating) levels (, low, mid, or high) in accordance with section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, expressed in megawatts, thousands of lb/hr of steam, mmBtu/hr of thermal output, or ft/sec (as applicable);

(D) Except for peaking units, an indicator of whether the second most frequently used load (or operating) level is designated as normal in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part;

(E) The date of the data analysis used to determine the normal load (or operating) level(s) and the two most frequently-used load (or operating) levels (as applicable); and

(F) Activation and deactivation dates and hours, when the maximum hourly gross load, boundaries of the range of operation, normal load (or operating) level(s) or two most frequently-used load (or operating) levels change and are updated.

(viii) For each unit for which CEMS are not installed:

(A) Maximum hourly gross load (in MW, rounded to the nearest MW, or steam load in klb/hr, rounded to the nearest klb/hr, or steam load in mmBtu/hr, rounded to the nearest mmBtu/hr);

(B) The upper and lower boundaries of the range of operation (as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part), expressed in megawatts, mmBtu/hr of thermal output, or thousands of lb/hr of steam;

(C) Except for peaking units and units using the low mass emissions excepted methodology under ยง 75.19, identify the load level designated as normal, pursuant to section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, expressed in megawatts, mmBtu/hr of thermal output, or thousands of lb/hr of steam;

(D) The date of the load analysis used to determine the normal load level (as applicable); and

(E) Activation and deactivation dates and hours, when the maximum hourly gross load, boundaries of the range of operation, or normal load level change and are updated.

(ix) For each unit with a flow monitor installed on a rectangular stack or duct, if a wall effects adjustment factor (WAF) is determined and applied to the hourly flow rate data:

(A) Stack or duct width at the test location, ft;

(B) Stack or duct depth at the test location, ft;

(C) Wall effects adjustment factor (WAF), to the nearest 0.0001;

(D) Method of determining the WAF;

(E) WAF Effective date and hour;

(F) WAF no longer effective date and hour (if applicable);

(G) WAF determination date;

(H) Number of WAF test runs;

(I) Number of Method 1 traverse points in the WAF test;

(J) Number of test ports in the WAF test; and

(K) Number of Method 1 traverse points in the reference flow RATA.
