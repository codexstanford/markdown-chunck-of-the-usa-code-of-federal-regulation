###### 12.7 Amount of Individual Target Compound i in the Sample by Isotope Dilution (pg).

This equation corrects for the target native compound recovery based on its labeled pre-extraction standard analog. This equation is also used to calculate the amount of pre-sampling adsorbent standard and pre-extraction filter recovery standard recovered.

For the quantitation of the pre-sampling adsorbent standard and the pre-extraction filter recovery standard, use a corresponding pre-extraction isomer (or homolog) with the closest retention time.
