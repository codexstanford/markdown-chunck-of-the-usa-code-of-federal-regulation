####### Flexible fabric sleeve seal

means a seal made of an elastomeric fabric (or other material) which covers an opening in a floating roof deck, and which allows the penetration of a fixed roof support column. The seal is attached to the rim of the deck opening and extends to the outer surface of the column. The seal is draped (but does not contact the stored liquid) to allow the horizontal movement of the deck relative to the column.
