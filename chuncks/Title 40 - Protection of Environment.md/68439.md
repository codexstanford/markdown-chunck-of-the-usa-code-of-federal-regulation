####### Vacated Federal rule.

(5)Arkansas adopted and was authorized for the following Federal rule which has since been vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. 08-1144; June 27, 2014). As a result, the Arkansas provisions at Reg. 23, 260.10 "Gasification" and 261.4(a)(12)(i) are no longer considered to be part of the State's authorized program. Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA removed the vacated provisions from the CFR on April 8, 2015.
