###### Acceptable results.

(b)The results of a quarterly flow-to-load (or gross heat rate) evaluation are acceptable, and no further action is required, if the calculated value of Eis less than or equal to: (1) 15.0 percent, if Lfor the most recent normal-load flow RATA is ≥60 megawatts (or ≥500 klb/hr of steam) and if unadjusted flow rates were used in the calculations; or (2) 10.0 percent, if Lfor the most recent normal-load flow RATA is ≥60 megawatts (or ≥500 klb/hr of steam) and if bias-adjusted flow rates were used in the calculations; or (3) 20.0 percent, if Lfor the most recent normal-load flow RATA is <60 megawatts (or <500 klb/hr of steam) and if unadjusted flow rates were used in the calculations; or (4) 15.0 percent, if Lfor the most recent normal-load flow RATA is <60 megawatts (or <500 klb/hr of steam) and if bias-adjusted flow rates were used in the calculations. If Eis above these limits, the owner or operator shall either: implement Option 1 in section 2.2.5.1 of this appendix; or perform a RATA in accordance with Option 2 in section 2.2.5.2 of this appendix; or re-examine the hourly data used for the flow-to-load or GHR analysis and recalculate E, after excluding all non-representative hourly flow rates. If Eis above these limits, the owner or operator shall either: implement Option 1 in section 2.2.5.1 of this appendix; perform a RATA in accordance with Option 2 in section 2.2.5.2 of this appendix; or (if applicable) re-examine the hourly data used for the flow-to-load or GHR analysis and recalculate E, after excluding all non-representative hourly flow rates, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
