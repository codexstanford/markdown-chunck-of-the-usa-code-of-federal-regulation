######## see

(C) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a noncombustion device, determine the predominant organic HAP using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 18 in appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C. Use Method 18, ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14), or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as C

(iii) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except that the schedule in ยง 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the results of the performance evaluation must be included in the notification of compliance status report.

(iv) The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data, except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations in the manufacturing of a coating. Operating block averages may be used only for process vessel data.
