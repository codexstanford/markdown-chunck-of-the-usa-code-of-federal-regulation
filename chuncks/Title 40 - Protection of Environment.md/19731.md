####### Gaseous emission test for coating operations using carbon adsorption beds with individual exhausts.

(2)This method is applicable when emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel. The owner or operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures:

(i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that each volumetric flow rate and the total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in ยง 60.745 (b) through (g);

(ii) Assure that all VOC emissions from the coating operation are segregated from other VOC sources and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in ยง 60.743(a)(1)(ii) (A) and (B);

(iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources connected and operating;

(iv) Determine the efficiency (H) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 3:

(v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system (H) by computing the average efficiency of the adsorber vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Q) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 4:

(vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system using Equation (2).

(vii) For each affected coating operation subject to ยง 60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (H)x(F) is equal to or greater than 0.90.
