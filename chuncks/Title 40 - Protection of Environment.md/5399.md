####### Exclusions from increment consumption.

(f)(1) The plan may provide that the following concentrations shall be excluded in determining compliance with a maximum allowable increase:

(i) Concentrations attributable to the increase in emissions from stationary sources which have converted from the use of petroleum products, natural gas, or both by reason of an order in effect under section 2 (a) and (b) of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 (or any superseding legislation) over the emissions from such sources before the effective date of such an order;

(ii) Concentrations attributable to the increase in emissions from sources which have converted from using natural gas by reason of natural gas curtailment plan in effect pursuant to the Federal Power Act over the emissions from such sources before the effective date of such plan;

(iii) Concentrations of particulate matter attributable to the increase in emissions from construction or other temporary emission-related activities of new or modified sources;

(iv) The increase in concentrations attributable to new sources outside the United States over the concentrations attributable to existing sources which are included in the baseline concentration; and

(v) Concentrations attributable to the temporary increase in emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or nitrogen oxides from stationary sources which are affected by plan revisions approved by the Administrator as meeting the criteria specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

(2) If the plan provides that the concentrations to which paragraph (f)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, refers shall be excluded, it shall also provide that no exclusion of such concentrations shall apply more than five years after the effective date of the order to which paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, refers or the plan to which paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, refers, whichever is applicable. If both such order and plan are applicable, no such exclusion shall apply more than five years after the later of such effective dates.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) For purposes of excluding concentrations pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, the Administrator may approve a plan revision that:

(i) Specifies the time over which the temporary emissions increase of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or nitrogen oxides would occur. Such time is not to exceed 2 years in duration unless a longer time is approved by the Administrator.

(ii) Specifies that the time period for excluding certain contributions in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, is not renewable;

(iii) Allows no emissions increase from a stationary source which would:
