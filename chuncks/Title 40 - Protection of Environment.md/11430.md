(61) The Governor of Colorado submitted a portion of the requirements for the moderate nonattainment area PMState Implementation Plan (SIP) for Denver, Colorado with a letter dated June 7, 1993, and subsequent submittals dated September 3, 1993, and October 20, 1993, fulfilling most of the commitments made in the June 7, 1993, letter. The submittals were made to satisfy those moderate PMnonattainment area SIP requirements due for the Denver PMnonattainment area on November 15, 1991. EPA is approving, for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP, the control measures contained in the SIP revisions identified above. (EPA is not approving, at this time, the control measures limiting the emissions from Purina Mills and Electron Corporation.)
