###### Gas source type.

6.1.2.1.2Assign a value for gas source type to each source as follows:

- Determine if the source meets the minimum size requirement based on the source hazardous waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5). If the source receives a source hazardous waste quantity value of 0.5 or more, consider the source to meet the minimum size requirement.

- If the source meets the minimum size requirement, assign it a value from table 6-4 for gas source type.

- If the source does not meet the minimum size requirement, assign it a value of 0 for gas source type.

If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, assign each source at the site a value from table 6-4 for gas source type.
