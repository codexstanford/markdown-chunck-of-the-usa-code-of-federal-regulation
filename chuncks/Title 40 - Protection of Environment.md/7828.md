####### Compliance determination for ton per day NO,limit.

(v)Compliance with the NOemission limit described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section shall be determined based on a rolling 30-kiln-operating-day basis. The rolling 30-kiln operating day NOemission rate for the kilns shall be calculated for each kiln operating day in accordance with the following procedure: Step one, sum the hourly pounds of NOemitted from both kilns for the current kiln operating day and the preceding twenty-nine (29) kiln-operating-day period for both kilns; Step two, divide the total pounds of NOcalculated from Step one by two thousand (2,000) to calculate the total tons of NO; Step three, divide the total tons of NOcalculated from Step two by thirty (30) to calculate the rolling 30-kiln operating day NOemission rate for both kilns. Each rolling 30-kiln operating day NOemission rate shall include all emissions that occur from both kilns during all periods within any kiln operating day, including emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
