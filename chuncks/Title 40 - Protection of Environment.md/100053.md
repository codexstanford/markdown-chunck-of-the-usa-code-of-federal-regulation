####### Critical emission-related maintenance.

(a)Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of critical emission-related components. Critical emission-related maintenance may also include additional emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related maintenance on these components if you demonstrate that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use vehicles. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions:

(1) You present data showing that, if a lack of maintenance increases emissions, it also unacceptably degrades the vehicle's performance.

(2) You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of vehicles in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended intervals.

(3) You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance instructions.

(4) You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals.
