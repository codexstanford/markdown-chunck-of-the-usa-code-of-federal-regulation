####### Lean-on-cruise" calibration strategies.

(14) "(i) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, the manufacturer must state in the Application for Certification whether any "lean-on-cruise" strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design. A "lean-on-cruise" air-fuel calibration strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry, during non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. "Lean-on-cruise" air-fuel calibration strategies must not be employed during vehicle operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of the following conditions is met:

(A) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP or SFTP;

(B) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce vehicle NMHC + NOemission control effectiveness over the operating conditions in which they are employed; or

(C) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware.

(ii) If the manufacturer proposes to use a "lean-on-cruise" calibration strategy, the manufacturer must specify the circumstances under which such a calibration would be used, and the reason or reasons for the proposed use of such a calibration.
