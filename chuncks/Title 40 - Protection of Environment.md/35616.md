######## Coating operation

means equipment used to apply cleaning materials to a substrate to prepare it for coating application or to remove dried or wet coating (surface preparation); to apply coating to a substrate (coating application) and to dry or cure the coating after application; and to clean coating operation equipment (equipment cleaning). A single coating operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a coating or cleaning material is applied and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP emissions from that coating or cleaning material occur. There may be multiple coating operations in an affected source. Coating application with hand-held nonrefillable aerosol containers, touchup markers, or marking pens is not a coating operation for the purposes of this subpart.
