##### Subpart E - Papergrade Sulfite Subcategory
###### ยง 430.51 Specialized definitions.
####### Sulfite cooking liquor

(b)is defined as bisulfite cooking liquor when the pH of the liquor is between 3.0 and 6.0 and as acid sulfite cooking liquor when the pH is less than 3.0.

(c) For this subpart, the segments for the papergrade sulfite subcategory are defined as follows:

(1) The calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium-based sulfite pulp segment consists of papergrade sulfite mills where pulp and paper are produced using an acidic cooking liquor of calcium, magnesium, or sodium sulfite, unless those mills are specialty grade sulfite mills;

(2) The ammonium-based sulfite pulp segment consists of papergrade sulfite mills where pulp and paper are produced using an acidic cooking liquor of ammonium sulfite, unless those mills are specialty grade sulfite mills;

(3) The specialty grade sulfite pulp segment consists of those papergrade sulfite mills where a significant portion of production is characterized by pulp with a high percentage of alpha cellulose and high brightness sufficent to produce end products such as plastic molding compounds, saturating and laminating products, and photographic papers. The specialty grade segment also includes those mills where a major portion of production is 91 ISO brightness and above.
