####### Vehicle tailpipe to CVS Duct.

(2)For methanol-fueled vehicles, cooling of the exhaust gases in the duct connecting the vehicle tailpipe to the CVS shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:

(i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C); heating and possibly cooling capabilities are required; or

(ii) Using a short duct (up to 12 feet long) constructed of smooth wall pipe with a minimum of flexible sections, maintained at a temperature above the maximum dew point of the exhaust, but below 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C), prior to the test and during the 10 minute hot soak segment and uninsulated during the test (insulation may remain in place and/or heating may occur during testing provided maximum temperature is not exceeded); or

(iii) Using smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no required heating. A maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed under this option; or

(iv) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution function at the vehicle tailpipe exit.
