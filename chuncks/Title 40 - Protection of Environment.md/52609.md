####### Well testing.

(l)You must indicate whether you performed gas well or oil well testing, and if the testing of gas wells or oil wells resulted in vented or flared emissions during the calendar year. If you performed well testing that resulted in vented or flared emissions during the calendar year, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.

(1) If you used Equation W-17A of § 98.233 to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions at actual conditions from oil wells and the emissions are not vented to a flare, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section.

(i) Number of wells tested in the calendar year.

(ii) Well ID numbers for the wells tested in the calendar year.

(iii) Average number of well testing days per well for well(s) tested in the calendar year.

(iv) Average gas to oil ratio for well(s) tested, in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

(v) Average flow rate for well(s) tested, in barrels of oil per day. You may delay reporting of this data element if you indicate in the annual report that wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that are tested. If you elect to delay reporting of this data element, you must report by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) the measured average flow rate for well(s) tested and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement.

(vi) Annual COemissions, in metric tons CO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(vii) Annual CHemissions, in metric tons CH, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(2) If you used Equation W-17A of § 98.233 to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions at actual conditions from oil wells and the emissions are vented to a flare, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section.

(i) Number of wells tested in the calendar year.

(ii) Well ID numbers for the wells tested in the calendar year.

(iii) Average number of well testing days per well for well(s) tested in the calendar year.

(iv) Average gas to oil ratio for well(s) tested, in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

(v) Average flow rate for well(s) tested, in barrels of oil per day. You may delay reporting of this data element if you indicate in the annual report that wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that are tested. If you elect to delay reporting of this data element, you must report by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) the measured average flow rate for well(s) tested and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement.

(vi) Annual COemissions, in metric tons CO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(vii) Annual CHemissions, in metric tons CH, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(viii) Annual NO emissions, in metric tons NO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(3) If you used Equation W-17B of § 98.233 to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions at actual conditions from gas wells and the emissions were not vented to a flare, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (l)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section.

(i) Number of wells tested in the calendar year.

(ii) Well ID numbers for the wells tested in the calendar year.

(iii) Average number of well testing days per well for well(s) tested in the calendar year.

(iv) Average annual production rate for well(s) tested, in actual cubic feet per day. You may delay reporting of this data element if you indicate in the annual report that wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that are tested. If you elect to delay reporting of this data element, you must report by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) the measured average annual production rate for well(s) tested and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement.

(v) Annual COemissions, in metric tons CO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(vi) Annual CHemissions, in metric tons CH, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(4) If you used Equation W-17B of § 98.233 to calculate annual volumetric natural gas emissions at actual conditions from gas wells and the emissions were vented to a flare, then you must report the information specified in paragraphs (l)(4)(i) through (vii) of this section.

(i) Number of wells tested in calendar year.

(ii) Well ID numbers for the wells tested in the calendar year.

(iii) Average number of well testing days per well for well(s) tested in the calendar year.

(iv) Average annual production rate for well(s) tested, in actual cubic feet per day. You may delay reporting of this data element if you indicate in the annual report that wildcat wells and/or delineation wells are the only wells that are tested. If you elect to delay reporting of this data element, you must report by the date specified in § 98.236(cc) the measured average annual production rate for well(s) tested and the well ID number(s) for the well(s) included in the measurement.

(v) Annual COemissions, in metric tons CO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(vi) Annual CHemissions, in metric tons CH, calculated according to § 98.233(l).

(vii) Annual NO emissions, in metric tons NO, calculated according to § 98.233(l).
