####### Selecting a disposal facility.

An acceptable disposal facility for asbestos wastes must adhere to EPA's requirements of no visible emissions to the air during disposal, or minimizing emissions by covering the waste within 24 hours. The minimum required cover is 6 inches of nonasbestos material, normally soil, or a dust-suppressing chemical. In addition to these Federal requirements, many state or local government agencies require more stringent handling procedures. These agencies usually supply a list of "approved" or licensed asbestos disposal sites upon request. Solid waste control agencies are listed in local telephone directories under state, county, or city headings. A list of state solid waste agencies may be obtained by calling the RCRA hotline: 1-800-424-9346 (382-3000 in Washington, DC). Some landfill owners or operators place special requirements on asbestos waste, such as placing all bagged waste into 55-gallon metal drums. Therefore, asbestos removal contractors should contact the intended landfill before arriving with the waste.
