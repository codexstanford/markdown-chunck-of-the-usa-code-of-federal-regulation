####### Test procedures,Summary of the test.

(c)-(1)(i) Test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. If a flow-through test is performed, the flow of dilution water through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired.

(ii) The test substance is introduced into each test chamber. In a flow-through test, the amount of test substance which is added to the dilution water is adjusted to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in each test chamber.

(iii) Test fish which have been acclimated in accordance with the test design are introduced into the test and control chambers by stratified random assignment.

(iv) Fish in the test and control chambers are observed periodically during the test; dead fish are removed at least twice each day and the findings are recorded.

(v) The dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature and the concentration of test substance are measured at intervals in selected test chambers.

(vi) Concentration-response curves and LCvalues for the test substance are developed from the mortality data collected during the test.
