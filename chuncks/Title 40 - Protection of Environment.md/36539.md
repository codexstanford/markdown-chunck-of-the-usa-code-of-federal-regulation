####### 13.3 Repeatability Check.

Conduct the following check once for each nominal range that is to be used on the CO EC cell within 5 days prior to each field sampling program. If a field sampling program lasts longer than 5 days, repeat this check every 5 days. Immediately repeat the check if the EC cell is replaced or if the EC cell is exposed to gas concentrations greater than 150 percent of the highest up-scale gas concentration.
