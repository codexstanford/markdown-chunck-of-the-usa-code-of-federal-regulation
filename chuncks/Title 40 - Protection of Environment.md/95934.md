####### Test parameters.

(3)Environmental parameters of the water contained in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:

(i) The test temperature shall be 25 &#xB0;C. Excursions from the test temperature shall be no greater than +/-2 &#xB0;C.

(ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done before the addition of the test substance. All treatment and control chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.

(iii) The number of mysids placed in a test solution shall not be so great as to affect results of the test. Loading requirements for the test will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. The loading shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below the recommended levels.

(iv) Photoperiod of 14 hours light and 10 hours darkness, with a 15-30 minute transition period.

(v) Salinity of 20 parts per thousand +/-3 percent.
