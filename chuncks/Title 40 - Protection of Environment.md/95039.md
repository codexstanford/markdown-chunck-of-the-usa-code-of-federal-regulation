####### e.g.,,e.g.,

(G) In the event a government entity has identified the existence of unsafe conditions (natural disasters, outbreaks, political unrest, epidemics, and pandemics) in the area of a composite wood product manufacturing panel producer that would prevent the required quarterly inspections from being conducted in-person on-site, a TPC may opt to perform a remote quarterly inspection in lieu of the in-person on-site inspection. Such a remote inspection may occur only during the period of the unsafe conditions. For such a remote inspection during the period of the unsafe conditions, the TPC must conduct a remote quarterly inspection via live remote technology (video/teleconference) operating as directed by the TPC to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(F) of this section, and work with the panel producer quality control manager at that time to select, package, sign, and ship the TPC panels/samples for the quarterly test according to ยง 770.20(c). TPCs and panel producers must remain in close communication with each other to ensure any changes or developments that might affect the panel producer or product type certification are managed according to the TSCA Title VI regulations in this part. The standard practice for a TPC providing certification services for composite wood panel producers remains that a TPC conducts in-person quarterly inspections and sample collection, packaging, signature, and shipping for quality control testing.
