####### Glider kit

means either of the following:

(1) A new vehicle that is incomplete because it lacks an engine, transmission, and/or axle(s).

(2) Any other new equipment that is substantially similar to a complete motor vehicle and is intended to become a complete motor vehicle with a previously used engine (including a rebuilt or remanufactured engine). For example, incomplete heavy-duty tractor assemblies that are produced on the same assembly lines as complete tractors and that are made available to secondary vehicle manufacturers to complete assembly by installing used/remanufactured engines, transmissions and axles are glider kits.
