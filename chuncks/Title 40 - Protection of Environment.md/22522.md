###### Calibration Span,i.e.

3.4means the upper limit of valid instrument response during sampling. To the extent practicable the measured emissions are to be between 10 and 100 percent of the selected calibration span (, the measured emissions should be within the calibrated range determined by the Low- and High-Level gas standards). It is recommended that the calibration span be at least twice the native concentration to accommodate the dynamic spiking procedure.
