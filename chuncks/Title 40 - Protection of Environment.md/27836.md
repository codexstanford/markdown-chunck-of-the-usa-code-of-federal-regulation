####### Organic HAP content level determination-averaged chemical milling maskants.

(l)For those uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that are averaged together in order to comply with the chemical milling maskant organic HAP content level specified in ยง 63.747(c)(1), the procedure specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.

(1) Determine the total organic HAP weight fraction as applied of each chemical milling maskant used during each 30-day period using the procedure specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(2) Determine for each 30-day period:

(i) The individual volume of each chemical milling maskant applied in terms of total gallons (less water) (using the procedure specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), and

(ii) The total volume in gallons of all chemical milling maskants (less water) as applied by summing the individual volumes of each chemical milling maskant as applied (less water).

(3) Determine the density of each chemical milling maskant as applied used during each 30-day period using the procedure specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(4) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume (lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied for all chemical milling maskants during each 30-day period using equation 22:
