16.2 Application of EPA test Method 3A. If you elect to perform periodic stack testing to comply with aemissions limit, a separate measurement of the diluent gas (COor O) concentration is required for each test run in which EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B is used, in order to convert the measured pollutant concentration to units of the standard. The EPA test Method 3A is the preferred COor Otest method, although EPA test Method 3B may be used instead. Diluent gas measurements are also needed for stack gas molecular weight determinations when using EPA test Method 2.
