##### Subpart LLL - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry
###### Emission Standards and Operating Limits
####### § 63.1348 Compliance requirements.
######## Initial Performance Test Requirements.

(a)For an affected source subject to this subpart, you must demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the test methods and procedures in §§ 63.1349 and 63.7. Any affected source that was unable to demonstrate compliance before the compliance date due to being idled, or that had demonstrated compliance but was idled during the normal window for the next compliance test, must demonstrate compliance within 180 days after coming out of the idle period. Any cement kiln that has been subject to the requirements of subpart CCCC or subpart DDDD of 40 CFR Part 60, and is now electing to cease burning nonhazardous solid waste and become subject to this subpart, must meet all the initial compliance testing requirements each time it becomes subject to this subpart, even if it was previously subject to this subpart.
