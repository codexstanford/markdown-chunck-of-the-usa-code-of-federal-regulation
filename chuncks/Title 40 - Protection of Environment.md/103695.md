####### Accuracy and precision.

(b)The dynamometer's output values for road load must be NIST-traceable. We may determine traceability to a specific national or international standards organization to be sufficient to demonstrate NIST-traceability. The force-measurement system must be capable of indicating force readings as follows:

(1) For dynamometer testing of vehicles at or below 20,000 pounds GVWR, the dynamometer force-measurement system must be capable of indicating force readings during a test to a resolution of +/-0.05% of the maximum load-cell force simulated by the dynamometer or +/-9.8 N (+/-2.2 lbf), whichever is greater.

(2) For dynamometer testing of vehicles above 20,000 pounds GVWR, the force-measurement system must be capable of indicating force readings during a test to a resolution of +/-0.05% of the maximum load-cell force simulated by the dynamometer or +/-39.2 N (+/-8.8 lbf), whichever is greater.
