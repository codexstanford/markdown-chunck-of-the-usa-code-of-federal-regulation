###### ยง 52.2497 Significant deterioration of air quality.

(a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not fully met because the plan does not include approvable procedures for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality from:

(1) Facilities with carbon dioxide (CO) emissions from the industrial combustion of biomass in the following circumstances:

(i) Where a new major stationary source or major modification would be subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements for greenhouse gases (GHGs) under 40 CFR 52.21 but would not be subject to PSD under the state implementation plan (SIP) because COemissions from the industrial combustion of biomass are excluded from consideration as GHGs as a matter of state law under RCW 70.235.020(3); or

(ii) Where a new major stationary source or major modification is subject to PSD for GHGs under both the Washington SIP and the FIP, but COemissions from the industrial combustion of biomass are excluded from consideration in the Ecology PSD permitting process because of the exclusion in RCW 70.235.020(3);

(2) Indian reservations in Washington, except for non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation (also known as the 1873 Survey Area) as provided in the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, and any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction.
