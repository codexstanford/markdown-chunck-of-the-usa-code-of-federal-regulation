means:

(1) For manual transmission code light-duty trucks, the engine speed with the transmission in neutral or with the clutch disengaged and with the air conditioning system, if present, turned off. For automatic transmission code light-duty trucks, curb-idle means the engine speed with the automatic transmission in the Park position (or Neutral position if there is no Park position), and with the air conditioning system, if present, turned off.

(2) For manual transmission code heavy-duty engines, the manufacturer's recommended engine speed with the clutch disengaged. For automatic transmission code heavy-duty engines, curb idle means the manufacturer's recommended engine speed with the automatic transmission in gear and the output shaft stalled. (Measured idle speed may be used in lieu of curb-idle speed for the emission tests when the difference between measured idle speed and curb idle speed is sufficient to cause a void test under 40 CFR 1065.530 but not sufficient to permit adjustment in accordance with 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E.
