###### ยง 98.233 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### GHG volumetric emissions using actual conditions.

(t)If equation parameters in ยง 98.233 are already determined at standard conditions as provided in the introductory text in ยง 98.233, which results in volumetric emissions at standard conditions, then this paragraph does not apply. Calculate volumetric emissions at standard conditions as specified in paragraphs (t)(1) or (2) of this section, with actual pressure and temperature determined by engineering estimates based on best available data unless otherwise specified.

(1) Calculate natural gas volumetric emissions at standard conditions using actual natural gas emission temperature and pressure, and Equation W-33 of this section for conversions of Eor conversions of FR(whether sub-sonic or sonic).

(2) Calculate GHG volumetric emissions at standard conditions using actual GHG emissions temperature and pressure, and Equation W-34 of this section.

You may use either a default compressibility factor of 1, or a site-specific compressibility factor based on actual temperature and pressure conditions.

(3) Reporters using 68 &#xB0;F for standard temperature may use the ratio 519.67/527.67 to convert volumetric emissions from 68 &#xB0;F to 60 &#xB0;F.
