###### ยง 1065.680 Adjusting emission levels to account for infrequently regenerating aftertreatment devices.
####### F

(i) Determine the frequency of regeneration,, in a way that incorporates the impact of cold-start operation in proportion to the cold-start weighting factor specified in the standard-setting part. You may use good engineering judgment to determine the effect of cold-start operation analytically.

(ii) Treat cold-start testing and hot-start testing together as a single test segment for adjusting measured emission results under this section. Apply the adjustment factor to the composite emission result.

(iii) You may apply the adjustment factor only to the hot-start test result if your aftertreatment technology does not regenerate during cold operation as represented by the cold-start transient duty cycle. If we ask for it, you must demonstrate this by engineering analysis or by test data.

(c) If an engine has multiple regeneration strategies, determine and apply adjustment factors under this section separately for each type of regeneration.
