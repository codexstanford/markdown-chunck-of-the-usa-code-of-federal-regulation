###### Screening.

3.27Screening is used when there is little or no available information about a source. The purpose of screening is to determine what analytes are emitted and to obtain information about important sample characteristics such as moisture, temperature, and interferences. Screening results are semi-quantitative (estimated concentrations) or qualitative (identification only). Various optical and sampling configurations may be used. Sample conditioning systems may be evaluated for their effectiveness in removing interferences. It is unnecessary to perform a complete run under any set of sampling conditions. Spiking is not necessary, but spiking can be a useful screening tool for evaluating the sampling system, especially if a reactive or soluble analyte is used for the spike.
