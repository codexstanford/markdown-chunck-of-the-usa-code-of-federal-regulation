####### Purified air

means air meeting the specifications for purified air in ยง 1065.750. Purified air may be produced by purifying ambient air. The purification may occur at the test site or at another location (such as at a gas supplier's facility). Alternatively, purified air may be synthetically generated, using good engineering judgment, from purified oxygen and nitrogen. The addition of other elements normally present in purified ambient air (such as Ar) is not required.
