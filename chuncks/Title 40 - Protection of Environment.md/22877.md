"The temperature in the stove and the gases entering the combustor must be raised to between&#xB0; to&#xB0;F for catalytic activity to be initiated. During the startup of a cold stove, a medium to high firing rate must be maintained for aboutminutes. This ensures that the stove, catalyst, and fuel are all stabilized at proper operating temperatures. Even though it is possible to have gas temperatures reach&#xB0;F withintominutes after a fire is started, if the fire is allowed to die down immediately, it may go out or the combustor may stop working. Once the combustor starts working, heat generated in it by burning the smoke will keep it working."
