######## Technical definitions.

(b)(1) Aerosol transport is the percentage of a laboratory challenge aerosol which penetrates to the active sample filter of the candidate equivalent method sampler.

(2) The active sample filter is the exclusive filter through which sample air is flowing during performance of this test.

(3) A no-flow filter is a sample filter through which no sample air is intended to flow during performance of this test.

(4) A channel is any of two or more flow paths that the aerosol may take, only one of which may be active at a time.

(5) An added component is any physical part of the sampler which is different in some way from that specified for a reference method sampler in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable, such as a device or means to allow or cause the aerosol to be routed to one of several channels.
