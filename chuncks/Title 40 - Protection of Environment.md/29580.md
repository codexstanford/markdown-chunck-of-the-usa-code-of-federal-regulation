###### § 63.1109 Recordkeeping requirements.
####### e.g.,

(1) The owner or operator must maintain standard site procedures used to deinventory equipment for safety purposes (hot work or vessel entry procedures) to document the procedures used to meet the requirements in § 63.1103(e)(5). The current copy of the procedures must be retained and available on-site at all times. Previous versions of the standard site procedures, as applicable, must be retained for 5 years.

(2) If complying with the requirements of § 63.1103(e)(5)(i)(A) and the LEL at the time of the vessel opening exceeds 10 percent, records that identify the maintenance vent, the process units or equipment associated with the maintenance vent, the date of maintenance vent opening, and the LEL at the time of the vessel opening.

(3) If complying with the requirements of § 63.1103(e)(5)(i)(B) and either the vessel pressure at the time of the vessel opening exceeds 5 psig or the LEL at the time of the active purging was initiated exceeds 10 percent, records that identify the maintenance vent, the process units or equipment associated with the maintenance vent, the date of maintenance vent opening, the pressure of the vessel or equipment at the time of discharge to the atmosphere and, if applicable, the LEL of the vapors in the equipment when active purging was initiated.

(4) If complying with the requirements of § 63.1103(e)(5)(i)(C), records of the estimating procedures used to determine the total quantity of VOC in equipment and the type and size limits of equipment that contain less than 50 pounds of VOC at the time of maintenance vent opening. For each maintenance vent opening of equipment that contains greater than 50 pounds of VOC for which the deinventory procedures specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are not followed or for which the equipment opened exceeds the type and size limits established in the records specified in this paragraph, records that identify the maintenance vent, the process units or equipment associated with the maintenance vent, the date of maintenance vent opening, and records used to estimate the total quantity of VOC in the equipment at the time the maintenance vent was opened to the atmosphere.

(5) If complying with the requirements of § 63.1103(e)(5)(i)(D), identification of the maintenance vent, the process units or equipment associated with the maintenance vent, records documenting actions taken to comply with other applicable alternatives and why utilization of this alternative was required, the date of maintenance vent opening, the equipment pressure and LEL of the vapors in the equipment at the time of discharge, an indication of whether active purging was performed and the pressure of the equipment during the installation or removal of the blind if active purging was used, the duration the maintenance vent was open during the blind installation or removal process, and records used to estimate the total quantity of VOC in the equipment at the time the maintenance vent was opened to the atmosphere for each applicable maintenance vent opening.
