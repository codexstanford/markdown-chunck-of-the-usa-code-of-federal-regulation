###### ยง 1065.140 Dilution for gaseous and PM constituents.
####### General.

(a)You may dilute exhaust with ambient air, purified air, or nitrogen. References in this part to "dilution air" may include any of these. For gaseous emission measurement, the dilution air must be at least 15 &#xB0;C. Note that the composition of the dilution air affects some gaseous emission measurement instruments' response to emissions. We recommend diluting exhaust at a location as close as possible to the location where ambient air dilution would occur in use. Dilution may occur in a single stage or in multiple stages. For dilution in multiple stages, the first stage is considered primary dilution and later stages are considered secondary dilution.
