I.

1. To determine whether a project constitutes a major modification, the reviewing authority shall apply the principles set out in paragraphs IV.I.1(i) through (v) of this Ruling.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph IV.I.2 of this Ruling, and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph II.A.5 of this Ruling, a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases-a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph II.A.23 of this Ruling), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs II.A.6 and 10 of this Ruling). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase.
