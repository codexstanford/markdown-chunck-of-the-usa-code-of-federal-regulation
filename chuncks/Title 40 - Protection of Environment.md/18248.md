####### Process tank

means a tank that is used within a process (including a solvent or raw material recovery process) to collect material discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within the process, to a product or by-product storage vessel, or to a vessel used to store recovered solvent or raw material. In many process tanks, unit operations such as reactions and blending are conducted. Other process tanks, such as surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, however, may not involve unit operations.
