####### Heating value.

(g)The net heating value shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, or by using the engineering assessment procedures in paragraph (k) of this section.

(1) The net heating value of the continuous process vent shall be calculated using Equation 1:

(2) The molar composition of the process vent (D) shall be determined using the methods specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:

(i) The methods specified in ยง 63.1414(a) to measure the concentration of each organic compound.

(ii) American Society for Testing and Materials D1946-90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14) to measure the concentration of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

(iii) Method 4 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure the moisture content of the stack gas.
