(ii)For engines without a high-speed governor, determine the amount of negative torque at the maximum safe speed or the maximum representative speed. For engines with a high-speed governor, determine the amount of negative torque at a speed at or aboveper ยง 1065.610(c)(2).

(4) For engines with an electric hybrid system, map the negative torque required to motor the engine and absorb any power delivered from the RESS by repeating paragraph (g)(2) of this section with minimum operator demand, stopping the sweep to discharge the RESS when the absolute instantaneous power measured from the RESS drops below the expected maximum absolute power from the RESS by more than 2% of total system maximum power (including engine motoring and RESS power) as determined from mapping the negative torque.

(5) For engines with an electric hybrid system, map the negative torque required to motor the engine by repeating paragraph (b) of this section with minimum operator demand and a fully charged RESS or with the hybrid system disabled, such that it doesn't affect the motoring torque. You may start the negative torque map at either the minimum or maximum speed from paragraph (b) of this section.
