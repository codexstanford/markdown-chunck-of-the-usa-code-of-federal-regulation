(ii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide), EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19-10.1981 (incorporated by reference,ยง 60.17), as applicable, must be used.

(2) The span value of the continuous emission monitoring system must be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential nitrogen oxide emissions of the unit.

(3) Conduct accuracy determinations quarterly and calibration drift tests daily in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.

(4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be re-established during performance compliance tests:
