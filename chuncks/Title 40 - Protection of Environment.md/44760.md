(3)Completed tests must be graded by an entity or individual who receives no benefit based on the outcome of testing; a fee may be charged for grading. Sufficient measures must be taken at the test site to ensure that tests are completed honestly by each technician. Each test must provide a means of verifying the identification of the individual taking the test. Programs are encouraged to make provisions for non-English speaking technicians by providing tests in other languages or allowing the use of a translator when taking the test. If a translator is used, the certificate received must indicate that translator assistance was required.
