(2) A new or reconstructed 2SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;

(3) A new or reconstructed 4SLB stationary RICE with a site rating of less than 250 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;

(4) A new or reconstructed spark ignition 4 stroke rich burn (4SRB) stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;

(5) A new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions which combusts landfill or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis;

(6) A new or reconstructed emergency or limited use stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions;

(7) A new or reconstructed compression ignition (CI) stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions.
