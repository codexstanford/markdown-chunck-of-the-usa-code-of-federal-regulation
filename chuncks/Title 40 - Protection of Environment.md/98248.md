() An evaluation of epididymal (or vas deferens) sperm motility should be performed. Sperm should be recovered while minimizing damage (the evaluation techniques as described in the reference under paragraph (g)(8) of this section may be used), and the percentage of progressively motile sperm should be determined either subjectively or objectively. For objective evaluations, an acceptable counting chamber of sufficient depth can be used to effectively combine the assessment of motility with sperm count and sperm morphology. When computer-assisted motion analysis is performed, the derivation of progressive motility relies on user-defined thresholds for average path velocity and straightness or linear index. If samples are videotaped, or images otherwise recorded, at the time of necropsy, subsequent analysis of only control and high-dose P and F1 males may be performed unless treatment-related effects are observed; in that case, the lower dose groups should also be evaluated. In the absence of a video or digital image, all samples in all treatment groups should be analyzed at necropsy.
