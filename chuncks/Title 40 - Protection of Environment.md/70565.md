###### Calculation of surface water migration pathway score.

4.3Determine the surface water migration pathway score as follows:

- If only one of the two surface water migration components (overland/flood or ground water to surface water) is scored, assign the score of that component as the surface water migration pathway score.

- If both components are scored, select the higher of the two component scores from sections 4.1.6 and 4.2.6. Assign that score as the surface water migration pathway score.
