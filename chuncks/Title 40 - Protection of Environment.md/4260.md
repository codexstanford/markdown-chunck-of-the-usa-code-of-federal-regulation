1.1 This ultraviolet fluorescence (UVF) method provides a measurement of the concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO) in ambient air for determining compliance with the national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for sulfur oxides (sulfur dioxide) as specified in ยง 50.4, ยง 50.5, and ยง 50.17 of this chapter. The method is applicable to the measurement of ambient SOconcentrations using continuous (real-time) sampling. Additional quality assurance procedures and guidance are provided in part 58, appendix A, of this chapter and in Reference 3.

2.1 This reference method is based on automated measurement of the intensity of the characteristic fluorescence released by SOin an ambient air sample contained in a measurement cell of an analyzer when the air sample is irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light passed through the cell. The fluorescent light released by the SOis also in the ultraviolet region, but at longer wavelengths than the excitation light. Typically, optimum instrumental measurement of SOconcentrations is obtained with an excitation wavelength in a band between approximately 190 to 230 nm, and measurement of the SOfluorescence in a broad band around 320 nm, but these wavelengths are not necessarily constraints of this reference method. Generally, the measurement system (analyzer) also requires means to reduce the effects of aromatic hydrocarbon species, and possibly other compounds, in the air sample to control measurement interferences from these compounds, which may be present in the ambient air. References 1 and 2 describe UVF method.
