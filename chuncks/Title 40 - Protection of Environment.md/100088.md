(x). Section 1037.526 generally requires you to adjust Δvalues from alternate test methods to be equivalent to measurements with the primary test method. This paragraph (x) describes approximations that we believe are consistent with good engineering judgment; however, you may not use these approximations where we determine that clear and convincing evidence shows that they would significantly overestimate actual improvements in aerodynamic performance.

(1) You may presume that CFD measurements at a yaw angle of 4.5&#xB0; are equal to measurements made using the primary method, and you may use them without adjustment.

(2) You may presume that coastdown measurements at yaw angles smaller than +/- 4.5&#xB0; are equal to measurements made using the primary method, and you may use them without adjustment. This applies equally for device manufacturers, but it does not apply for EPA testing.

(3) You may use testing or analytical methods to adjust coastdown measurements to account for aerodynamic effects at a yaw angle of +/-4.5&#xB0;. This applies for rear fairings and other devices whose performance is affected by yaw angle.
