####### PTFE Filters and Filter Acceptance Testing.

6.1.2The PTFE filters used for PMsample collection shall meet the specifications provided in part 50, appendix L. The following requirements are similar to those currently specified for the acceptance of PMfilters that are tested for trace elements by EDXRF. For large filter lots (greater than 500 filters) randomly select 20 filters from a given lot. For small lots (less than 500 filters) a lesser number of filters may be taken. Analyze each blank filter separately and calculate the average lead concentration in ng/cm. Ninety percent, or 18 of the 20 filters, must have an average lead concentration that is less than 4.8 ng Pb/cm.
