###### One hundred percent line.

3.9A double beam transmittance spectrum obtained by combining two background single beam spectra. Ideally, this line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every frequency in the spectrum. Practically, a zero absorbance line is used to measure the baseline noise in the spectrum.
