####### Distributor Caps and/or Rotors.

(7)(i) The emission-critical parameters for distributor caps and/or rotors are:

(A) Physical and Thermal Integrity.

(B) Dielectric Strength.

(C) Flashover.

(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph:

(A) "Flashover" means the discharge of ignition voltage across the surface of the distributor cap and/or rotor rather than at the spark plug gap.

(B) "Dielectric Strength" means the ability of the material of the cap and/or rotor to resist the flow of electric current.

(C) "Physical and Thermal Integrity" means the ability of the material of the cap and/or rotor to resist physical and thermal breakdown.
