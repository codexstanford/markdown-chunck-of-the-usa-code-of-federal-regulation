####### e.g.,

(d) When estimating emissions using Equation T-1 of this subpart, you must ensure that all the quantities required by Equation T-1 of this subpart have been measured using scales or load cells with an accuracy of 1 percent of full scale or better, accounting for the tare weights of the containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas supplierfor the contents of containers containing new gas or for the heels remaining in containers returned to the gas supplier) if the supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are met; however you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses or weights under this subpart.

(e) When estimating emissions using Equations T-2 and T-3 of this subpart, you must monitor and record container identities and masses as follows:

(1) Track the identities and masses of containers leaving and entering storage with check-out and check-in sheets and procedures. The masses of cylinders returning to storage shall be measured immediately before the cylinders are put back into storage.
