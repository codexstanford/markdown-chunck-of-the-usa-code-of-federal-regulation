####### Initial compliance.

(2)For determining the ethylene oxide concentration required in ยง 63.363(c)(2), the procedures outlined in Method 18 or Method 25 A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used. A Method 18 or Method 25A test consists of three 1-hour runs. If using Method 25A to determine concentration, calibrate and report Method 25A instrument results using ethylene oxide as the calibration gas. The arithmetic average of the ethylene oxide concentration of the three test runs shall determine the overall outlet ethylene oxide concentration from the control device.
