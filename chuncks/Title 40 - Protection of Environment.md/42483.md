###### ยง 75.10 General operating requirements.
####### Minimum recording and recordkeeping requirements.
######## i.e.

(iii) Any bias-adjusted hourly average SOconcentration of less than 2.0 ppm recorded by the SOmonitoring system shall be adjusted to a default value of 2.0 ppm, for reporting purposes. Such adjusted hourly averages shall be considered to be quality-assured data, provided that the monitoring system is operating and is not out-of-control with respect to any of the quality assurance tests required by appendix B of this part (, daily calibration error, linearity and relative accuracy test audit).

(iv) In accordance with the requirements of section 2.1.1.2 of appendix A to this part, for units that sometimes burn gaseous fuel that is very low sulfur fuel (as defined in ยง 72.2 of this chapter) and at other times burn higher sulfur fuel(s) such as coal or oil, a second low-scale SOmeasurement range is not required when the very low sulfur gaseous fuel is combusted. For units that burn only gaseous fuel that is very low sulfur fuel and burn no other type(s) of fuel(s), the owner or operator shall set the span of the SOmonitoring system to a value no greater than 200 ppm.

(4) The provisions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, may also be used for the combustion of a solid or liquid fuel that meets the definition of very low sulfur fuel in ยง 72.2 of this chapter, mixtures of such fuels, or combinations of such fuels with gaseous fuel, if the owner or operator submits a petition under ยง 75.66 for a default SOemission rate for each fuel, mixture or combination, and if the Administrator approves the petition.
