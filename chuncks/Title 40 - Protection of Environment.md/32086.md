####### Control device

means any combustion device, recovery device, or recapture device. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. For continuous process vents, recapture devices are considered control devices but recovery devices are not considered control devices. Condensers operating as process condensers are not considered control devices. For a condenser that sometimes operates as a process condenser to be considered a control device, it shall not be operating as a process condenser for a given batch emission episode, and it shall recycle of the recovered material within the process.
