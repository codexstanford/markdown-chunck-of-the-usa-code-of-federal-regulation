######### Application.

(a)You may use a chemiluminescent detector (CLD) to measure NOconcentration in raw or diluted exhaust for batch or continuous sampling. We generally accept a CLD for NOmeasurement, even though it measures only NO and NO, when coupled with an NO-to-NO converter, since conventional engines and aftertreatment systems do not emit significant amounts of NOspecies other than NO and NO. Measure other NOspecies if required by the standard-setting part. While you may also use other instruments to measure NO, as described in ยง 1065.272, use a reference procedure based on a chemiluminescent detector for comparison with any proposed alternate measurement procedure under ยง 1065.10.
