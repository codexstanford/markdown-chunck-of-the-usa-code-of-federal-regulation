####### Data reporting requirements.

(5)(i) ExxonMobil shall submit quarterly reports beginning with the first calendar quarter following May 21, 2008. The quarterly reports shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. The quarterly reports shall be submitted to EPA at the following address: Air Program Contact, EPA Montana Operations Office, Federal Building, 10 West 15th Street, Suite 3200, Helena, MT 59626.

The quarterly report shall be certified for accuracy in writing by a responsible ExxonMobil official. The quarterly report shall consist of both a comprehensive electronic-magnetic report and a written hard copy data summary report.

(ii) The electronic report shall be on magnetic or optical media, and such submittal shall follow the reporting format of electronic data being submitted to the MDEQ. EPA may modify the reporting format delineated in this section, and, thereafter, ExxonMobil shall follow the revised format. In addition to submitting the electronic quarterly reports to EPA, ExxonMobil shall also record, organize, and archive for at least five (5) years the same data, and upon request by EPA, ExxonMobil shall provide EPA with any data archived in accordance with this provision. The electronic report shall contain the following:

(A) Hourly average total sulfur concentrations as HS or SOin ppm in the gas stream to the flare(s);

(B) Hourly average HS concentrations of the flare pilot and purge gases in ppm;

(C) Hourly average SOconcentrations in ppm from the Coker CO Boiler stack;

(D) Hourly average volumetric flow rates in SCFH of the flare pilot and purge gases;

(E) Hourly average volumetric flow rates in SCFH in the gas stream to the flare(s) and in the Coker CO Boiler stack;

(F) Hourly average HS concentrations in ppm from the refinery fuel gas system;

(G) Hourly average refinery fuel gas combustion units' actual fuel firing rate in SCFH;

(H) Hourly average temperature (in &#xB0;F) and pressure (in mm or inches of Hg) of the gas stream to the flare(s);

(I) Hourly emissions in pounds per clock hour from the flare(s), Coker CO Boiler stack, and refinery fuel gas combustion system; and

(J) Daily calibration data for the CEMS described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (f)(3)(ii) and (f)(4)(ii) of this section.

(iii) The quarterly written report shall contain the following information:

(A) The 3-hour emissions in pounds per 3-hour period from the flare(s), Coker CO Boiler stack, and refinery fuel gas combustion system;

(B) Periods in which only natural gas or an inert gas was used as flare pilot gas or purge gas or both;

(C) Daily emissions in pounds per calendar day from the Coker CO Boiler stack and refinery fuel gas combustion system;

(D) The results of all quarterly or other Cylinder Gas Audits (CGA), Relative Accuracy Audits (RAA), and annual Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA) for the CEMS described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) (flare total sulfur analyzer(s); pilot gas or purge gas HS analyzer(s)), (f)(3)(ii), and (f)(4)(ii) of this section, and the results of all annual calibrations and verifications for the volumetric flow, temperature, and pressure monitors;

(E) For all periods of flare volumetric flow rate monitoring system or total sulfur analyzer system downtime, Coker CO Boiler stack CEMS downtime, refinery fuel gas combustion system CEMS downtime, flare pilot gas or purge gas volumetric flow or HS analyzer system downtime, or failure to obtain or analyze a grab or integrated sample, the written report shall identify:
