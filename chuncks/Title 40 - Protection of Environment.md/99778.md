The x-axis is time and the y-axis is the mass emission rate at each data point,The data points coincident with any exclusion are illustrated with open circles. The shaded area corresponding to each group of closed circles represents the total emission mass over that test subinterval. Note that negative values ofare retained and not set to zero in the numerical integration calculation. The first group of data points without any exclusions is referred to as the first test subinterval and so on.
