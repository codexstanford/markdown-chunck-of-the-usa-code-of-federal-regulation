####### Measurement allowance

means a specified adjustment in the applicable emission standard or a measured emission value to reflect the relative quality of the measurement. See the standard-setting part to determine whether any measurement allowances apply for your testing. Measurement allowances generally apply only for field testing and are intended to account for reduced accuracy or precision that result from using field-grade measurement systems.
