##### Appendix D to Part 52 - Determination of Sulfur Dioxide Emissions From Stationary Sources by Continuous Monitors
###### Principle.

2.1Gases are continuously sampled in the stack emissions and analyzed for sulfur dioxide by a continuously operating emission measurement system. Performance specifications for the continuous measurement systems are given. Test procedures are given to determine the capability of the measurement systems to conform to the performance specifications. Sampling may include either the extractive or nonextractive (in-situ) approach.
