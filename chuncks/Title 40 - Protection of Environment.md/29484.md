####### Free cyanide

means chemical species of cyanide that are dissolved in water and are bioavailable and known for their toxic effects on living organisms. This refers to the sum of molecular hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanide ion (CN) dissolved in water. Included in this definition are the dissolved products of cyanide salts (including potassium cyanide [KCN] and sodium cyanide [NaCN]), as these salts dissociate to cyanide ion and hydrogen cyanide when added to water.
