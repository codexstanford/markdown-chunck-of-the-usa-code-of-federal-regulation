####### Temporary modification

means a modification to a vessel based on a written contract for marine services such that the modifications will be removed from the vessel when the contract expires. This provision is intended to address short-term contracts that would generally be less than 12 months in duration. You may ask us to consider modifications that will be in place longer than 12 months as temporary modifications.
