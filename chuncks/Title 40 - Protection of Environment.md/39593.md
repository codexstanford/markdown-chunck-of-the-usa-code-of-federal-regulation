######## i.e.,

(2) A minimum of three test runs must be conducted for each performance test of each process unit. Each test run conducted with Method 29 must collect a minimum sample volume of 0.85 dry standard cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). If conducted with Method 30B or ASTM D6784, determine sample time and volume according to the testing criteria set forth in the relevant method. If the emission testing results for any of the emission points yields a non-detect value, then the minimum detection limit (MDL) must be used to calculate the mass emissions rate (lb/hr) used to calculate the emissions factor (lb/ton) for that emission point and, in turn, for calculating the sum of the emissions (in units of pounds of mercury per ton of concentrate, or pounds of mercury per million tons of ore) for all emission points subject to the emission standard for determining compliance. If the resulting mercury emissions are greater than the MACT emission standard, the owner or operator may use procedures that produce lower MDL results and repeat the mercury emissions testing one additional time for any emission point for which the measured result was below the MDL. If this additional testing is performed, the results from that testing must be used to determine compliance (there are no additional opportunities allowed to lower the MDL).
