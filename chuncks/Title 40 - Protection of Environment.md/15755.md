####### ยง 53.53 Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, and cut-off.
######## Mean sample flow rate.

(1)(i) From the certified measurements (Q) of the test sampler flow rate obtained by use of the flow rate meter, tabulate each flow rate measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow rate for the sample period (Q) as follows:

(ii)(A) Calculate the percent difference between this mean flow rate value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:

(B) To successfully pass the mean flow rate test, the percent difference calculated in Equation 2 of this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) must be within +/-5 percent.
