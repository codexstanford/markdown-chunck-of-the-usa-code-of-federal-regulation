####### SC03 Test Cycle.

(d)The test procedure for determining exhaust emissions with the air conditioner operating (see § 86.160-00) is designed to determine gaseous exhaust emissions from light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks while simulating an urban trip during ambient conditions of 95 &#xB0;F, 100 grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent relative humidity), and a solar heat load intensity of 850 W/m. The full test consists of vehicle preconditioning (see § 86.132-00 paragraphs (o) (1) and (2)), an engine key-off 10 minute soak, an engine start, and operation over the SC03 cycle. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust is collected continuously during the engine start and the SC03 driving cycle for subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler or critical flow venturi sampler.

(e) The emission results from the aggressive driving test (§ 86.159-00), air conditioning test (§ 86.160-00), and a FTP test (§ 86.130-00 (a) through (d) and (f)) (conducted on a large single roll or equivalent dynamometer) are analyzed according to the calculation methodology in § 86.164-00 and compared to the applicable SFTP emission standards in subpart A of this part (§§ 86.108-00 and 86.109-00).

(f) These test procedures may be run in any sequence that maintains the applicable preconditioning elements specified in § 86.132-00.
