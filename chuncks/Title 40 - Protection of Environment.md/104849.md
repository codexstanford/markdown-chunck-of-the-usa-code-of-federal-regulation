######## Precision demonstration.

(b)Show that you meet precision criteria as follows:

(1) Meeting the precision criteria of this paragraph (b) qualifies your test instrument for performing up to 20 tests or 7 days, whichever is less. Include all tests except for testing to meet precision or accuracy requirements.

(2) Perform precision testing using the control-chart procedures in ASTM D6299. If you opt to use procedure 2A (Q-Procedure) or 2B (dynamically updated exponentially weighted moving average), validate the first run on the new QC batch by either an overlap in-control result of the old batch, or by a single execution of an accompanying standard reference material. The new QC material result would be considered validated if the single result of the standard reference material is within the established site precision (R') of the ARV of the standard reference material.

(3) Use I charts and MR charts as specified in ASTM D6299 to show that the standard deviation for the test instrument meets the precision criteria specified in ยง 1090.1365(b).
