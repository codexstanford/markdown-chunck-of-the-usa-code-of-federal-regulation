######## Determination of accelerated oil exposure targets.,i.e.

(h)The target oil exposure rate during accelerated aging is 10 times the field average oil consumption rate determined in ยง 1065.1133(a)(2). You must achieve this target exposure rate on a cycle average basis during aging. Use good engineering judgment to determine the oil exposure rates for individual operating modes that will achieve this cycle average target. For engine-based aging stands you will likely have different oil consumption rates for different modes depending on the speed and load conditions you set. For burner-based aging stands, you may find that you have to limit oil exposure rates at low exhaust flow or low temperature modes to ensure good atomization of injected oil. On a cycle average basis, the portion of oil exposure from the volatile introduction pathway (, oil doped in the burner or engine fuel) must be between (10 to 30)% of the total. The remainder of oil exposure must be introduced through bulk pathway.
