###### ยง 1065.305 Verifications for accuracy, repeatability, and noise.

(a) This section describes how to determine the accuracy, repeatability, and noise of an instrument. Table 1 of ยง 1065.205 specifies recommended values for individual instruments.

(b) We do not require you to verify instrument accuracy, repeatability, or noise.

However, it may be useful to consider these verifications to define a specification for a new instrument, to verify the performance of a new instrument upon delivery, or to troubleshoot an existing instrument.
