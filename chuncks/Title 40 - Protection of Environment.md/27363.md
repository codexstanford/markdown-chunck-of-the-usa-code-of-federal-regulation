() Procedures for calculating the percentage of reduction for pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(h) Credits are generated by the difference between emissions that are allowed for each Group 1 and Group 2 emission point and the actual emissions from a Group 1 or Group 2 emission point that has been controlled after November 15, 1990 to a level more stringent than what is required by this subpart or any other State or Federal rule or statute. Credits shall be calculated as follows:

(1) The overall equation for calculating sourcewide credits is:

(i) For an emission point controlled using a reference control technology, the percentage of reduction for calculating credits shall be no greater than the nominal efficiency associated with the reference control technology, unless a higher nominal efficiency is assigned as specified in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) For an emission point controlled to a level more stringent than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency for calculating credits shall be assigned as described in paragraph (i) of this section. A reference control technology may be approved for use in a different manner and assigned a higher nominal efficiency according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

(iii) For an emission point controlled using a pollution prevention measure, the nominal efficiency for calculating credits shall be determined as described in paragraph (j) of this section.

(2) Emissions from process vents shall be determined as follows:

(i) Uncontrolled emissions from miscellaneous process vents, EPV1, shall be calculated according to the procedures and equation for EPVin paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) Actual emissions from miscellaneous process vents controlled using a technology with an approved nominal efficiency greater than 98 percent or a pollution prevention measure achieving greater than 98 percent emission reduction, EPV1, shall be calculated according to the following equation:

(iii) The following procedures shall be used to calculate actual emissions from Group 2 process vents, EPV2:

(A) For a Group 2 process vent controlled by a control device, a recovery device applied as a pollution prevention project, or a pollution prevention measure, if the control achieves a percentage of reduction less than or equal to a 98 percent reduction,
