####### iv,Sensory function.

()A simple assessment of sensory function (vision, audition, pain perception) shall be made. Marshall et al. (1971) in § 798.6050(f)(8) of this chapter have described a neurologic exam for this purpose; these procedures are also discussed by Deuel (1977), under § 798.6050(f)(4) of this chapter. Irwin (1968) under § 798.6050(f)(7) of this chapter described a number of reflex tests intended to detect gross sensory deficits. Many procedures have been developed for assessing pain perception (e.g., Ankier (1974) under § 798.6050(f)(1); D'Amour and Smith (1941) under § 798.6050(f)(3); and Evans (1971) under § 798.6050(f)(6) of this chapter.
