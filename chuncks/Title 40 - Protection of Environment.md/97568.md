####### Test conditions.

(3)The test is preferably run at 20 +/-0.5 &#xB0;C (293 &#xB0;K). If temperature dependence is suspected in the solubility (&#x2264;3%/ &#xB0;C), two other temperatures should also be used-both differing from each other and the initially chosen temperature by 10 &#xB0;C. In this case the temperature control should be +/-0.1 &#xB0;C. One of these additional temperatures should be below the initial temperature. The chosen temperature(s) should be kept constant in all parts of the equipment (including the leveling vessel).
