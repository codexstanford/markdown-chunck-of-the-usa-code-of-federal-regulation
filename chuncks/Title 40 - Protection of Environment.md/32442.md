() The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition (including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These conditions include, but are not limited to the following: periods when the stream contains the highest combined VOC and HAP load described by the emission profiles in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)() of this section; periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach limits of solubility for scrubbing media; or periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.
