####### ยง 62.15190 Am I exempt from any 40 CFR part 60 appendix B or appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?

Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from two requirements:

(a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy requirement).

(b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy test audit).
