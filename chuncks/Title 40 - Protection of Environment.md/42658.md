###### ยง 75.34 Units with add-on emission controls.
####### i.e.

(3) For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data availability for SOor NO, calculated in accordance with ยง 75.32, is less than 90.0 percent and is greater than or equal to 80.0 percent; and parametric data establishes that the add-on emission controls were operating properly (within the range of operating parameters provided in the quality assurance/quality control program) during the hour, the owner or operator may:

(i) Replace the maximum SOconcentration recorded in the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours immediately preceding the missing data period, with the maximum controlled SO2 concentration recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or

(ii) Replace the maximum NOconcentration(s) or NOemission rate(s) from the appropriate load bin(s) (based on a lookback through the 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours immediately preceding the missing data period), with the maximum controlled NOconcentration(s) or emission rate(s) from the appropriate load bin(s) in the same 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hour lookback period.

(4) The designated representative may petition the Administrator under ยง 75.66 for approval of site-specific parametric monitoring procedure(s) for calculating substitute data for missing SOpollutant concentration, NOpollutant concentration, and NOemission rate data in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and appendix C to this part. The owner or operator shall record the data required in appendix C to this part, pursuant to ยง 75.58(b).
