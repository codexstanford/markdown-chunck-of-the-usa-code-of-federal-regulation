####### [object Object]

Adequate data for measuring the accuracy and precision of the method for samples with various matrices are not currently available. Data obtained for samples containing a single asbestos type in a simple matrix are available in the EPA report

A low-power binocular microscope, preferably stereoscopic, is used to examine the bulk insulation sample as received.

Compound microscope requirements: A polarized light microscope complete with polarizer, analyzer, port for wave retardation plate, 360&#xB0; graduated rotating stage, substage condenser, lamp, and lamp iris.

Sample preparation apparatus requirements will depend upon the type of insulation sample under consideration. Various physical and/or chemical means may be employed for an adequate sample assessment.
