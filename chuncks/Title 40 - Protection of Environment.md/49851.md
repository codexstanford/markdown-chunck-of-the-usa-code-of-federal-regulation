######## Permitting authority's and Administrator's actions.

(b)(1) If a CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204, the permitting authority will revise the CAIR SOopt-in unit's CAIR opt-in permit to meet the requirements of a CAIR permit under § 97.223, and remove the CAIR opt-in permit provisions, as of the date on which the CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204.

(2)(i) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR SOopt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204, CAIR SOallowances equal in amount to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:

(A) Any CAIR SOallowances allocated to the CAIR SOopt-in unit under § 97.288 for any control period after the date on which the CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204; and

(B) If the date on which the CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204 is not December 31, the CAIR SOallowances allocated to the CAIR SOopt-in unit under § 97.288 for the control period that includes the date on which the CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the date on which the CAIR SOopt-in unit becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204 divided by the total number of days in the control period and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(ii) The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the source that includes the CAIR SOopt-in unit that becomes a CAIR SOunit under § 97.204 contains the CAIR SOallowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
