####### Liability.

(c)Being a certificate holder under this section means that if in-use testing indicates that a certified locomotive using one or more of your approved components does not comply with an applicable emission standard, we will presume that you and other certificate holders are liable for the noncompliance. However, we will not hold you liable in cases where you convince us that your components did not cause the noncompliance. Conversely, we will not hold other certificate holders liable for noncompliance caused solely by your components. You are also subject to the warranty and defect reporting requirements of this part for your certified components. Other requirements of this part apply as specified in ยง 1033.1.
