###### 6.2.7 Sample Gas Manifold.

For the type of system shown in Figure 7E-1, the sample gas manifold diverts a portion of the sample to the analyzer, delivering the remainder to the by-pass discharge vent. The manifold should also be able to introduce calibration gases directly to the analyzer (except for dilution-type systems). The manifold must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled or the calibration gas and be configured to safely discharge the bypass gas.
