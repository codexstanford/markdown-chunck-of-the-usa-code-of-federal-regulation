####### Draft permits.

(a)(1) The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete pursuant to ยง 71.7(a)(3).

(2) Once an application for an initial permit, permit revision, or permit renewal is complete, the permitting authority shall decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.

A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit and follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this section. If the permitting authority's final decision is that the initial decision to deny the permit application was incorrect, it shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(4) If the permitting authority decides to prepare a draft permit, it shall prepare a draft permit that contains the permit conditions required under ยง 71.6.

(5) All draft permits prepared under this section shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment.
