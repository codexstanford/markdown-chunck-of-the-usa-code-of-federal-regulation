6.8.5 Internal standard solution-If the internal standard calibration technique is to be used, prepare pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) at a concentration of 10 Âµg/mL in ethyl acetate. Alternative and multiple internal standards; e.g., tetrachloro--xylene, 4,4&#x2032;-dibromobiphenyl, and/or decachlorobiphenyl may be used provided that the laboratory performs all QC tests and meets all QC acceptance criteria with the alternative or additional internal standard(s) as an integral part of this method.
