(i)(A) Illinois Pollution Control Board Final Opinion and Order, PCB 93-257, adopted on September 1, 1994, and effective on September 1, 1994. Certification dated 9/23/94 of Acceptance by J. M. Sweeney.

(111) On July 29, 1994, Illinois submitted regulations which require adoption and implementation of particulate matter contingency measures for Illinois' four moderate particulate matter nonattainment areas. Sources in the nonattainment areas which emit at least 15 tons of particulate matter must submit two levels of contingency measures, which will then become Federally enforceable. Sources will be required to implement the contingency measures if an exceedance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Particulate Matter is measured, or if the United States Environmental Protection Agency finds that an area has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
