###### Emissions Standards and Operating Limits for Solid Fuel Boilers, Liquid Fuel Boilers, and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnaces
####### § 63.1217 What are the standards for liquid fuel boilers that burn hazardous waste?
######## Emission limits for existing sources.

(a)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

(1)(i) Dioxins and furans in excess of 0.40 ng TEQ/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, for liquid fuel boilers equipped with a dry air pollution control system; or

(ii) Either carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this section for sources not equipped with a dry air pollution control system;

(iii) A source equipped with a wet air pollution control system followed by a dry air pollution control system is not considered to be a dry air pollution control system, and a source equipped with a dry air pollution control system followed by a wet air pollution control system is considered to be a dry air pollution control system for purposes of this emission limit;

(2) For mercury, except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:

(i) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value less than 10,000 Btu/lb, emissions in excess of 19 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, on an (not-to-exceed) annual averaging period;

(ii) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value 10,000 Btu/lb or greater, emissions in excess of 4.2 x 10lbs mercury attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste on an (not-to-exceed) annual averaging period;

(iii) The boiler operated by Diversified Scientific Services, Inc. with EPA identification number TND982109142, and which burns radioactive waste mixed with hazardous waste, must comply with the mercury emission standard under § 63.1219(a)(2);

(3) For cadmium and lead combined, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2,

(i) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value less than 10,000 Btu/lb, emissions in excess of 150 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, on an (not-to-exceed) annual averaging period;

(ii) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value of 10,000 Btu/lb or greater, emissions in excess of 8.2 x 10lbs combined cadmium and lead emissions attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste on an (not-to-exceed) annual averaging period;

(4) For chromium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2:

(i) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value less than 10,000 Btu/lb, emissions in excess of 370 µgm/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(ii) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value of 10,000 Btu/lb or greater, emissions in excess of 1.3 x 10lbs chromium emissions attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste;

(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:

(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(6) For hydrogen chloride and chlorine, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2:

(i) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value less than 10,000 Btu/lb, emissions in excess of 31 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Cl) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(ii) When you burn hazardous waste with an as-fired heating value of 10,000 Btu/lb or greater, emissions in excess of 5.1 x 10lbs combined emissions of hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste;

(7) For particulate matter, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2 or as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, emissions in excess of 80 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
