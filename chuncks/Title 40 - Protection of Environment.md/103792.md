####### Cruise cycles.

(2)Cruise test cycles are typically specified in the standard-setting part as a discrete operating point that has a single speed command.

(i) Start a cruise cycle as a hot-running test, where you start to measure emissions after the engine is started and warmed up and the vehicle is running at the target test speed.

(ii) Sample emissions and other parameters for the cruise cycle in the same manner as a transient cycle, with the exception that the reference speed value is constant. Record instantaneous and mean speed values over the cycle.
