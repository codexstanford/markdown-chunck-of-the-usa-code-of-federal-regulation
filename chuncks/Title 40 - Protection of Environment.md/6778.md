###### Offset credit for meeting NSPS or NESHAPS.,i.e.,

6.Where a source is subject to an emission limitation established in a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) or a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), (requirements under sections 111 and 112, respectively, of the Act), and a different SIP limitation, the more stringent limitation shall be used as the baseline for determining credit for emission and air quality offsets. The difference in emissions between the SIP and the NSPS or NESHAPS, for such source may not be used as offset credit. However, if a source were not subject to an NSPS or NESHAPS, for example if its construction had commenced prior to the proposal of an NSPS or NESHAPS for that source category, offset credit can be permitted for tightening the SIP to the NSPS or NESHAPS level for such source.
