##### Subpart C - General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources
###### ยง 98.33 Calculating GHG emissions.
####### Calculation of CH,and N,O emissions from stationary combustion sources.

(c)You must calculate annual CHand NO mass emissions only for units that are required to report COemissions using the calculation methodologies of this subpart and for only those fuels that are listed in Table C-2 of this subpart.

(1) Use Equation C-8 of this section to estimate CHand NO emissions for any fuels for which you use the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation methodologies for CO, except when natural gas usage in units of therms or mmBtu is obtained from gas billing records. In that case, use Equation C-8a in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or Equation C-8b in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (as applicable). For Equation C-8, use the same values for fuel consumption that you use for the Tier 1 or Tier 3 calculation.

(i) Use Equation C-8a to calculate CHand NO emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms.

(ii) Use Equation C-8b to calculate CHand NO emissions when natural gas usage is obtained from gas billing records in units of mmBtu.
