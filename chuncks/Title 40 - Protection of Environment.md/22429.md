8.1.2 Adjust the probe temperature and the temperature of the filter and the stopcock (the heated area in Figure 26-1) to a temperature sufficient to prevent water condensation. This temperature must be maintained between 120 and 134 &#xB0;C (248 and 273 &#xB0;F). The temperature should be monitored throughout a sampling run to ensure that the desired temperature is maintained. It is important to maintain a temperature around the probe and filter in this range since it is extremely difficult to purge acid gases off these components. (These components are not quantitatively recovered and, hence, any collection of acid gases on these components would result in potential under reporting of these emissions. The applicable subparts may specify alternative higher temperatures.)
