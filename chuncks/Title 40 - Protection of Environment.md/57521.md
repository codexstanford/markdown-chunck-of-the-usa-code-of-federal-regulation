####### Area of review.

(e)Notwithstanding the alternatives presented in ยง 146.6 of this chapter, the area of review shall be a fixed radius as described in ยง 146.6(b) of this chapter.

(f) The applicant must give separate notice of intent to apply for a permit to each owner or tenant of the land within one-quarter mile of the site. The addresses of those to whom notice is given, and a description of how notice is given, shall be submitted with the permit application. The notice shall include:

(1) Name and address of applicant;

(2) A brief description of the planned injection activities, including well location, name and depth of the injection zone, maximum injection pressure and volume, and fluid to be injected;

(3) EPA contact person; and

(4) A statement that opportunity to comment will be announced after EPA prepares a draft permit. This requirement may be waived by the Regional Administrator when he determines that individual notice to all land owners and tenants would be impractical.
