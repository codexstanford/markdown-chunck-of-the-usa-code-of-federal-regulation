(b) The Regional Administrator shall attempt to resolve such disputes where:

(1) The difference in water quality standards results in unreasonable consequences;

(2) The dispute is between a State (as defined in ยง 131.3(j) but exclusive of all Indian Tribes) and a Tribe which EPA has determined is eligible to the same extent as a State for purposes of water quality standards;

(3) A reasonable effort to resolve the dispute without EPA involvement has been made;

(4) The requested relief is consistent with the provisions of the Clean Water Act and other relevant law;

(5) The differing State and Tribal water quality standards have been adopted pursuant to State and Tribal law and approved by EPA; and

(6) A valid written request has been submitted by either the Tribe or the State.

(c) Either a State or a Tribe may request EPA to resolve any dispute which satisfies the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. Written requests for EPA involvement should be submitted to the lead Regional Administrator and must include:

(1) A concise statement of the unreasonable consequences that are alleged to have arisen because of differing water quality standards;

(2) A concise description of the actions which have been taken to resolve the dispute without EPA involvement;

The Regional Administrator shall also make reasonable efforts to ensure that other interested individuals or groups have notice of this action. Such efforts shall include but not be limited to the following:

(4) Publication in trade journal newsletters, and

(5) Other means as appropriate.

(e) If in accordance with applicable State and Tribal law an Indian Tribe and State have entered into an agreement that resolves the dispute or establishes a mechanism for resolving a dispute, EPA shall defer to this agreement where it is consistent with the Clean Water Act and where it has been approved by EPA.

(f) EPA dispute resolution actions shall be consistent with one or a combination of the following options:
