####### ยง 63.2855 How do I determine the quantity of oilseed processed?
######## The dates that define each operating status period.

(1)The dates that define each operating status period include the beginning date of each calendar month and the date of any change in the source operating status. If, prior to the effective date of this rule, your source determines the oilseed inventory on an accounting month rather than a calendar month basis, and you have 12 complete accounting months of approximately equal duration in a calendar year, you may substitute the accounting month time interval for the calendar month time interval. If you choose to use an accounting month rather than a calendar month, you must document this measurement frequency selection in your plan for demonstrating compliance, and you must remain on this schedule unless you request and receive written approval from the agency responsible for these NESHAP. The dates on each oilseed inventory log must be consistent with the dates recorded for the solvent inventory.
