(ii)(A) Each litter should be examined as soon as possible after delivery (lactation day 0) to establish the number and sex of pups, stillbirths, live births, and the presence of gross anomalies. Pups found dead on day 0 should be examined for possible defects and cause of death.

(B) Live pups should be counted, sexed, and weighed individually at birth, or soon thereafter, at least on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 of lactation, at the time of vaginal patency or balanopreputial separation, and at termination.

(C) The age of vaginal opening and preputial separation should be determined for F1 weanlings selected for mating. If there is a treatment-related effect in F1 sex ratio or sexual maturation, anogenital distance should be measured on day 0 for all F2 pups.
