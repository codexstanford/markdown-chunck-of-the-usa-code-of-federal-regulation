####### ยง 63.7791 How do I comply with the requirements for the control of mercury?
######## Use of scrap that does not contain mercury switches.

(d)For BOPF scrap not complying with the requirements in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, you must certify in your initial notification of compliance report required by ยง 63.7840(f) and semiannual compliance report required by ยง 63.7841(a) and maintain records of documentation required by ยง 63.7842(e) establishing that the scrap does not contain mercury switches. You may satisfy this requirement by certifying and documenting that:

(1) The scrap does not contain motor vehicle scrap; or

(2) The scrap does not contain shredded motor vehicle scrap; or

(3) The only materials from motor vehicles in the scrap are materials recovered for their specialty alloy content (including, but not limited to, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or other alloys); therefore, based on the type of the scrap and purchase specifications, the scrap does not contain mercury switches.
