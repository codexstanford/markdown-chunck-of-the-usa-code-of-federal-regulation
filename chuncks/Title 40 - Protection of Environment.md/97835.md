####### Inhalability

is the ratio of the number concentration of particles of a certain aerodynamic diameter, d, that are inspired through the nose or mouth to the number concentration of the same dpresent in the inspired volume of ambient air. In humans, inhalability can exceed 15 µm d, whereas inhalability dramatically decreases for particles above 4 µm din small laboratory animals.
