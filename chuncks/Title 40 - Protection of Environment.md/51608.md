means fluorinated GHGs that are composed of a formate group -OCH(O) (carbonyl group with a single-bonded oxygen, and with a hydrogen atom) that is linked on the single-bonded oxygen atom to a hydrocarbon group in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon group is replaced by fluorine atoms; the typical formula for fluorinated formates is FROCH(O).
