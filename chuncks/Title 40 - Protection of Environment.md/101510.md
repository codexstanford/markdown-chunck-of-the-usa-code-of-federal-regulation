####### Fuel line

means hose, tubing, and primer bulbs containing or exposed to liquid fuel, including hose or tubing that delivers fuel to or from the engine, as follows:

(1) This includes flexible molded sections for transporting liquid fuel to or from the engine, but does not include inflexible components for connecting hose or tubing.

(2) This includes hose or tubing for the vent line or filler neck if fuel systems are designed such that any portion of the vent-line or filler-neck material continues to be exposed to liquid fuel after completion of a refueling event in which an operator fills the fuel tank using typical methods. For example, we would not consider a filler neck to be a fuel line if an operator stops refueling after an initial automatic shutoff that signals the fuel tank is full, where any liquid fuel in the filler neck during the refueling procedure drains into the fuel tank.

(3) This does not include primer bulbs that contain liquid fuel only for priming the engine before starting.
