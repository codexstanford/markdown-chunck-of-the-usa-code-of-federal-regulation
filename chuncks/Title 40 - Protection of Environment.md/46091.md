####### Engine misfire malfunction criteria.

(ii)(A) The OBD system must be capable of detecting misfire occurring in one or more cylinders. To the extent possible without adding hardware for this specific purpose, the OBD system must also identify the specific misfiring cylinder. If more than one cylinder is misfiring continuously, or if more than one but less than half of the cylinders are misfiring continuously (if the manufacturer can demonstrate the robustness of their monitor to the approval of the Administrator), a separate DTC must be stored indicating that multiple cylinders are misfiring. When identifying multiple cylinder misfire, the OBD system is not required to identify individually through separate DTCs each of the continuously misfiring cylinders.
