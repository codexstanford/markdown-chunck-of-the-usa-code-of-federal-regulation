####### Treatment process

means a process in which an off-site material stream is physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy, degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the off-site material. A treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A treatment process can be used to treat one or more off-site material streams at the same time.
