####### VOC content of the coating applied

(19)means the product of Method 24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if the data are demonstrated to be equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to the coating applicator. This quantity is intended to include all VOC that actually are emitted from the coating operation in the gaseous phase. Thus, for purposes of the liquid-liquid VOC material balance in ยง 60.713(b)(1), any VOC (including dilution solvent) added to the coatings must be accounted for, and any VOC contained in waste coatings or retained in the final product may be measured and subtracted from the total. (These adjustments are not necessary for the gaseous emission test compliance provisions of ยง 60.713(b).)
