###### Requests for designation.

(b)(1) The chief executive officer of the air pollution control agency of an area that believes it has more stringent air pollution control requirements than the NOA for a proposed OCS source, may submit a request to be designated as the COA to the Administrator and at the same time shall send copies of the request to the chief executive officer of the NOA and to the proposed source. The request must be received by the Administrator within 60 days of the receipt of the NOI. If no requests are received by the Administrator within 60 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will become the designated COA without further action.

(2) No later than 90 days after the receipt of the NOI, a demonstration must be received by the Administrator showing that:

(i) The area has more stringent requirements with respect to the control and abatement of air pollution than the NOA;

(ii) The emissions from the source are or would be transported to the requesting area; and

(iii) The transported emissions would affect the requesting area's efforts to attain or maintain a Federal or State ambient air quality standard or to comply with the requirements of part C of title I of the Act, taking into account the effect of air pollution control requirements that would be imposed if the NOA were designated as the COA.
