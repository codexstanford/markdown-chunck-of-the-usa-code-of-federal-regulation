###### Requirements for Showing Compliance
####### ยง 63.5170 How do I demonstrate compliance with the standards?
######## Oxidizer using performance tests and continuous monitoring of operating parameters compliance demonstration.

(3)For each oxidizer used to control emissions from one or more work stations for which you choose to demonstrate compliance through performance tests of capture efficiency, control device efficiency, and continuous monitoring of capture system and control device operating parameters, each month of the 12-month compliance period you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (g)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section:

(i) Monitor an operating parameter established in ยง 63.5150(a)(3) to ensure that control device destruction or removal efficiency is maintained; and

(ii) For each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer, monitor an operating parameter established in ยง 63.5150(a)(4) to ensure capture efficiency; and

(iii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those work stations served by each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer according to either paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section:

(A) In accordance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (v) and (ix) of this section if the work stations served by that capture system are only always-controlled work stations; or

(B) In accordance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (v), (ix), and (h) of this section if the work stations served by that capture system include one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controllable work stations.
