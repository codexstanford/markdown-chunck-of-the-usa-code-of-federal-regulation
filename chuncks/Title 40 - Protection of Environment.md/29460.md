####### Storage vessel degassing.,i.e.,

(10)Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), for each storage vessel subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of Table 7 to § 63.1103(e), the owner or operator must comply with paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section during storage vessel shutdown operations (emptying and degassing of a storage vessel) until the vapor space concentration in the storage vessel is less than 10 percent of the LEL.

(B) Reduce emissions of total organic HAP by 98 weight-percent by venting emissions through a closed vent system to any combination of non-flare control devices and meet the requirements specified in § 63.982(c)(1) and paragraph (e)(9) of this section.

(C) Reduce emissions of total organic HAP by 98 weight-percent by routing emissions to a fuel gas system or process and meet the requirements specified in § 63.982(d) and paragraph (e)(9) of this section.

(iii) Maintain records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in § 63.1108(a)(4)(ii) including, if appropriate, records of existing standard site procedures used to empty and degas (deinventory) equipment for safety purposes.
