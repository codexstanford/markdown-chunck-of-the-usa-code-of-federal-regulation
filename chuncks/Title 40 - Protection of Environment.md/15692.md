##### Subpart C - Procedures for Determining Comparability Between Candidate Methods and Reference Methods
###### ยง 53.33 Test Procedure for Methods for Lead (Pb).
####### Method Detection Limit (MDL).
######## Acceptability of measurement sets.

(h)Each measurement set is acceptable and valid only if the three reference method measurements and the three candidate method measurements are obtained and are valid, Rfalls within the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart, and either Por RPis within the corresponding limit for reference method precision specified in table C-4 of this subpart. For each site, table C-4 of this subpart specifies the minimum number of measurement sets required having Rabove and below specified concentrations for 24- or 48-hour samples. Additional measurement sets shall be obtained, as necessary, to provide the minimum number of acceptable measurement sets for each category and the minimum total number of acceptable measurement sets for each test site. If more than the minimum number of measurement sets are collected that meet the acceptability criteria, all such measurement sets shall be used to demonstrate comparability.
