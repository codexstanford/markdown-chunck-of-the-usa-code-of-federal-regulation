##### ยง 1027.115 What special provisions apply for certification related to nonroad and stationary engines?
###### see

(g) For marine compression-ignition engines, if you apply for a Federal certificate and an EIAPP certificate for the same engine family, a single fee applies for the engine family (40 CFR parts 94, 1042, and 1043).

(h) If you produce engines for multiple categories in a single engine family, a single fee applies for the engine family. For example, 40 CFR 60.4210 allows you to produce stationary and nonroad compression-ignition engines in a single engine family. If the certification fee for the different types of engines is different, the fee that applies for these engines is based on the emission standards to which you certify the engine family. For example, if you certify marine diesel engines to the standards that apply to land-based nonroad diesel engines under 40 CFR 94.912, the certification fee is based on the rate that applies for land-based nonroad diesel engines.
