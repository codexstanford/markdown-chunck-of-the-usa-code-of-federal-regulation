######### Units incorrectly allocated CSAPR NO,Annual allowances.

(c)(1) For each control period in 2015 and thereafter, if the Administrator determines that CSAPR NOAnnual allowances were allocated under paragraph (a) of this section, or under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(3), (4), or (5) of this chapter, where such control period and the recipient are covered by the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or were allocated under § 97.412(a)(2) through (7), (9), and (12) and (b)(2) through (7), (9), and (12), or under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(4) or (5) of this chapter, where such control period and the recipient are covered by the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will notify the designated representative of the recipient and will act in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section:

(i)(A) The recipient is not actually a CSAPR NOAnnual unit under § 97.404 as of January 1, 2015 and is allocated CSAPR NOAnnual allowances for such control period or, in the case of an allocation under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(3), (4), or (5) of this chapter, the recipient is not actually a CSAPR NOAnnual unit as of January 1, 2015 and is allocated CSAPR NOAnnual allowances for such control period that the SIP revision provides should be allocated only to recipients that are CSAPR NOAnnual units as of January 1, 2015; or

(B) The recipient is not located as of January 1 of the control period in the State from whose NOAnnual trading budget the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances allocated under paragraph (a) of this section, or under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(3), (4), or (5) of this chapter, were allocated for such control period.

(ii) The recipient is not actually a CSAPR NOAnnual unit under § 97.404 as of January 1 of such control period and is allocated CSAPR NOAnnual allowances for such control period or, in the case of an allocation under a provision of a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(4) or (5) of this chapter, the recipient is not actually a CSAPR NOAnnual unit as of January 1 of such control period and is allocated CSAPR NOAnnual allowances for such control period that the SIP revision provides should be allocated only to recipients that are CSAPR NOAnnual units as of January 1 of such control period.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, the Administrator will not record such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances under § 97.421.

(3) If the Administrator already recorded such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances under § 97.421 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section before making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.424(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances were recorded an amount of CSAPR NOAnnual allowances allocated for the same or a prior control period equal to the amount of such already recorded CSAPR NOAnnual allowances. The authorized account representative shall ensure that there are sufficient CSAPR NOAnnual allowances in such account for completion of the deduction.

(4) If the Administrator already recorded such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances under § 97.421 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section after making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.424(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will not make any deduction to take account of such already recorded CSAPR NOAnnual allowances.

(5)(i) With regard to the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted as an incorrect allocation, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for a recipient under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator will:

(A) Transfer such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances to the new unit set-aside for such control period (or a subsequent control period) for the State from whose NOAnnual trading budget the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances were allocated; or

(B) If the State has a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(4) or (5) of this chapter covering such control period, include such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances in the portion of the State NOAnnual trading budget that may be allocated for such control period (or a subsequent control period) in accordance with such SIP revision.

(ii) With regard to the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances that were not allocated from the Indian country new unit set-aside for such control period and that are not recorded, or that are deducted as an incorrect allocation, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for a recipient under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will:

(A) Transfer such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances to the new unit set-aside for such control period (or a subsequent control period); or

(B) If the State has a SIP revision approved under § 52.38(a)(4) or (5) of this chapter covering such control period, include such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances in the portion of the State NOAnnual trading budget that may be allocated for such control period (or a subsequent control period) in accordance with such SIP revision.

(iii) With regard to the CSAPR NOAnnual allowances that were allocated from the Indian country new unit set-aside for such control period and that are not recorded, or that are deducted as an incorrect allocation, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for a recipient under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Administrator will transfer such CSAPR NOAnnual allowances to the Indian country new unit set-aside for such control period (or a subsequent control period).
