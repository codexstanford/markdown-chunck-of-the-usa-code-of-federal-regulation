####### Periods of startup.

(b)If you own or operate a new or existing primary aluminum reduction affected source, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) and (b)(1) through (4) of this section during periods of startup for each affected potline.

(1) Develop a potline startup schedule before starting up the potline.

(2) Keep records of the number of pots started each day.

(3) Inspect potlines daily and adjust pot parameters to their optimum levels, as specified in the operating plan described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, including, but not limited to: alumina addition rate, exhaust air flow rate, cell voltage, feeding level, anode current and liquid and solid bath levels.

(4) Prepare a written operating plan to minimize emissions during startup to include, but not limited to, the requirements in (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The operating plan must include a specified high temperature limit for pots that will trigger corrective action.
