####### Tank permeation.

(b)Fuel tanks must meet the permeation requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.103. Portable marine fuel tanks must meet permeation standards starting January 1, 2011. Fuel tanks for personal watercraft must meet permeation standards starting in the 2011 model year. Other installed fuel tanks must meet permeation standards starting in the 2012 model year. Vessel manufacturers may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with the requirements of this paragraph under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program, as described in subpart H of this part. Starting in the 2014 model year for personal watercraft and in the 2015 model year for other installed fuel tanks, family emission limits may not exceed 5.0 g/m/day if testing occurs at a nominal temperature of 28 &#xB0;C, or 8.3 g/m/day if testing occurs at a nominal temperature of 40 &#xB0;C. These FEL caps do not apply to fuel caps that are certified separately to meet permeation standards. Portable marine fuel tank manufacturers may not generate or use emission credits under subpart H of this part.
