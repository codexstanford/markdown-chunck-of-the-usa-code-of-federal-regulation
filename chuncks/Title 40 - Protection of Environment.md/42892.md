#### PART 75 - CONTINUOUS EMISSION MONITORING
##### Appendix A to Part 75 - Specifications and Test Procedures
###### e.g.,

(a) Automated data acquisition and handling systems shall read and record the entire range of pollutant concentrations and volumetric flow from zero through full-scale and provide a continuous, permanent record of all measurements and required information in an electronic format. These systems also shall have the capability of interpreting and converting the individual output signals from an SOpollutant concentration monitor, a flow monitor, a COmonitor, an Omonitor, a NOpollutant concentration monitor, a NO-diluent CEMS, and a moisture monitoring system to produce a continuous readout of pollutant emission rates or pollutant mass emissions (as applicable) in the appropriate units (lb/hr, lb/mmBtu, tons/hr).

(b) Data acquisition and handling systems shall also compute and record: Monitor calibration error; any bias adjustments to SO, NO, flow rate, or NOemission rate data; and all missing data procedure statistics specified in subpart D of this part.

(c) For an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E of this part, data acquisition and handling systems shall:

(1) Read and record the full range of fuel flowrate through the upper range value;

(2) Calculate and record intermediate values necessary to obtain emissions, such as mass fuel flowrate and heat input rate;

(3) Calculate and record emissions in the appropriate units (e.g., lb/hr of SO, lb/mmBtu of NO);

(4) Predict and record NOemission rate using the heat input rate and the NO/heat input correlation developed under appendix E of this part;

(5) Calculate and record all missing data substitution values specified in appendix D or E of this part; and

(6) Provide a continuous, permanent record of all measurements and required information in an electronic format.

For the purposes of part 75, calibration gases include the following:
