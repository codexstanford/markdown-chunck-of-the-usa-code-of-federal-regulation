###### Calibration Error.

6.2.2Using the data from section 5.1 of this appendix, subtract the measured SOvalue determined under section 5.1.1 (Figure D-1) from the value shown by the measurement system for each of the 5 readings at each concentration measured under section 5.1.2 (Figure D-2). Calculate the mean of these difference values and the 95 percent confidence intervals according to equations D-1 and D-2. The calibration error is reported as the sum of absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval as a percentage of each respective calibration gas concentration. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-2.
