####### State approval of waiver application.

(3)The State shall notify the system of its waiver determination, in writing, setting forth the basis of its decision and any condition of the waiver. As a condition of the waiver, the State may require the system to perform specific activities (e.g., limited monitoring, periodic outreach to customers to remind them to avoid installation of materials that might void the waiver) to avoid the risk of lead or copper concentration of concern in tap water. The small system must continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap as required by paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section, as appropriate, until it receives written notification from the State that the waiver has been approved.
