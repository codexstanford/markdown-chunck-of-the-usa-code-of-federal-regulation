###### Zero Drift,2-hour,consecutive

6.2.3(). Using the zero concentration values measured each two hours during the field test, calculate the differences betweentwo-hour readings expressed in ppm. Calculate the mean difference and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean value and the confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
