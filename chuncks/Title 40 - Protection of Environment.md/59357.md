####### What standards for marking do my refillable containers have to meet?

(d)Each refillable container must be marked in a durable and clearly visible manner with a serial number or other identifying code that will distinguish the individual container from all other containers. Durable marking includes, but is not limited to, etching, embossing, ink jetting, stamping, heat stamping, mechanically attaching a plate, molding, and marking with durable ink. The serial number or other identifying code must be located on the outside part of the container except on a closure. Placement on the label or labeling is not sufficient unless the label is an integral, permanent part of or permanently stamped on the container.
