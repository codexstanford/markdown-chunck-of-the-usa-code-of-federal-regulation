###### Sampler shelter.

7.3

7.3.1 The sampler shelter shall:

a. Maintain the filter in a horizontal position at least 1 m above the sampler supporting surface so that sample air is drawn downward through the filter.

b. Be rectangular in shape with a gabled roof, similar to the design shown in Figure 1.

c. Cover and protect the filter and sampler from precipitation and other weather.

d. Discharge exhaust air at least 40 cm from the sample air inlet.

e. Be designed to minimize the collection of dust from the supporting surface by incorporating a baffle between the exhaust outlet and the supporting surface.

7.3.2 The sampler cover or roof shall overhang the sampler housing somewhat, as shown in Figure 1, and shall be mounted so as to form an air inlet gap between the cover and the sampler housing walls.This sample air inlet should be approximately uniform on all sides of the sampler.The area of the sample air inlet must be sized to provide an effective particle capture air velocity of between 20 and 35 cm/sec at the recommended operational flow rate. The capture velocity is the sample air flow rate divided by the inlet area measured in a horizontal plane at the lower edge of the cover.Ideally, the inlet area and operational flow rate should be selected to obtain a capture air velocity of 25 +/-2 cm/sec.
