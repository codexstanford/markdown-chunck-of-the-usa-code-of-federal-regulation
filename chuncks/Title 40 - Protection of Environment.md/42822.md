######### Reporting data prior to initial certification.

(g)If the owner or operator of an affected unit has not successfully completed all certification tests required by the State or federal NOmass emission reduction program that adopts the requirements of this subpart by the applicable date required by that program, he or she shall determine, record and report hourly data prior to initial certification using one of the following procedures, consistent with the monitoring equipment to be certified:

(1) For units that the owner or operator intends to monitor for NOmass emissions using NOemission rate and heat input rate, the maximum potential NOemission rate and the maximum potential hourly heat input of the unit, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.

(2) For units that the owner or operator intends to monitor for NOmass emissions using a NOconcentration monitoring system and a flow monitoring system, the maximum potential concentration of NOand the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part;

(3) For any unit, the reference methods under § 75.22 of this part.

(4) For any unit using the low mass emission excepted monitoring methodology under § 75.19, the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) or (2) of this section.

(5) Any unit using the procedures in paragraph (g)(2) of this section that is required to report heat input for purposes of allocating allowances shall also report the maximum potential hourly heat input of the unit, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.

(6) For any unit using continuous emissions monitors, the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix).
