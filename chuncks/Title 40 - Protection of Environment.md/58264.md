(ii) When used according to label directions, application results, immediately after application, in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products, in the diet of exposed birds at levels that equal or exceed one-fifth of the avian subacute dietary LC;

(iii) When used according to label directions, application results in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products, in water that equal or exceed one-tenth of the acute LCfor non-target aquatic organisms likely to be exposed; or

(iv) Under conditions of label use or widespread and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause discernible adverse effects on non-target organisms, such as significant mortality or effects on the physiology, growth, population levels or reproduction rates of such organisms, resulting from direct or indirect exposure to the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products.
