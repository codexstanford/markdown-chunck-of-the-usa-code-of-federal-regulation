###### ยง 61.343 Standards: Tanks.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and in ยง 61.351, the owner or operator must meet the standards in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section for each tank in which the waste stream is placed in accordance with ยง 61.342 (c)(1)(ii). The standards in this section apply to the treatment and storage of the waste stream in a tank, including dewatering.

(1) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a fixed-roof and closed-vent system that routes all organic vapors vented from the tank to a control device.

(i) The fixed-roof shall meet the following requirements:

(A) The cover and all openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells) shall be designed to operate with no detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppmv above background, as determined initially and thereafter at least once per year by the methods specified in ยง 61.355(h) of this subpart.

(B) Each opening shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a lid that is gasketed and latched) at all times that waste is in the tank except when it is necessary to use the opening for waste sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

(C) If the cover and closed-vent system operate such that the tank is maintained at a pressure less than atmospheric pressure, then paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section does not apply to any opening that meets all of thefollowing conditions:
