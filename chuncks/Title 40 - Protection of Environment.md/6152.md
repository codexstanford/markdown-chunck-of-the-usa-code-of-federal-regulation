###### ยง 51.905 How do areas transition from the 1-hour NAAQS to the 1997 8-hour NAAQS and what are the anti-backsliding provisions?
####### Does attainment of the ozone NAAQS affect the obligations under paragraph (a) of this section?

(b)A State remains subject to the obligations under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section until the area attains the 8-hour NAAQS. After the area attains the 8-hour NAAQS, the State may request such obligations be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP. Once an area attains the 1-hour NAAQS, the section 172 and 182 contingency measures under the 1-hour NAAQS can be shifted to contingency measures for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and must remain in the SIP until the area is redesignated to attainment for the 1997 8-hour NAAQS.
