######## Leak test procedure.

(d)Test a vehicle's fuel storage system for leaks as follows:

(1) Refuel vehicle to 40% of its nominal fuel tank capacity.

(2) Soak the vehicle for 6 to 24 hours at a temperature between (20 and 30) &#xB0;C; record this setpoint temperature and maintain temperatures throughout the leak test at this setpoint temperature within a tolerance +/-2 &#xB0;C.

(3) Before performing the test, purge the fuel storage system of any residual pressure, bringing the system into equilibrium with ambient pressure.

(4) Seal the evaporative canister's vent to atmosphere and ensure that the vehicle's purge valve is closed.

(5) Attach the leak test equipment to the vehicle.

(6) Pressurize the fuel storage system with Nor another inert gas 9392..........................to at least 2.4 kPa. Use good engineering judgment to avoid overpressurizing the system.

(7) Maintain gas flow through the system for at least 180 seconds, ensuring that the flow reading is stable for an effective leak diameter of +/-0.002 inches.
