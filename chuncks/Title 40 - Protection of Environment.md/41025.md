###### ยง 65.160 Performance test and TRE index value determination records.
####### Recovery device monitoring records during the TRE index value determination.

(c)For Group 2A process vents, the following records, as applicable, shall be maintained and reported as specified in ยง 65.164(a)(3):

(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the exit specific gravity and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or

(2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or

(3) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total regeneration stream mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time during each carbon-bed regeneration cycle during the period of the TRE index value determination, and temperature of the carbon-bed after each regeneration during the period of the TRE index value determination (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle or cycles); or

(4) As an alternative to paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, the concentration level or reading indicated by an organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period as the TRE index value determination while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted; and

(5) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream as specified in ยง 65.64(h).
