###### Transfer of organisms.

3.4.6Organisms should be handled as little as possible in order to minimize stress. Transfer Menidia and Mysidopsis from the acclimatization aquaria to the test chambers with a pipette or a wide-bore, smooth glass tube (4 to 8 mm internal diameter) fitted with a rubber bulb. Dip nets should be avoided when handling larval fish and mysids. Do not hold fish out of the water longer than necessary and discard any specimen accidentally dropped or otherwise mishandled during transfer.
