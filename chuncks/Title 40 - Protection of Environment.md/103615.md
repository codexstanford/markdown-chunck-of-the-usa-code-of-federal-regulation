######## Emission testing at intermediate and final test points.

(f)Conduct emission testing at the end of aging and at any intermediate emission test points as described in the standard setting part. Following installation of the aged aftertreatment system on the emission-data engine at intermediate or final test points, prior to the start of emission testing, use good engineering judgment to operate the engine and aftertreatment system for a number of hours to stabilize emission controls and to allow any adaptive controls to update. Declare the number of stabilization hours prior to the start of the accelerated aging program.
