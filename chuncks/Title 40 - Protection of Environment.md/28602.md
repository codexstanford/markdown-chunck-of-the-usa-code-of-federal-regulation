####### Drain control requirements.

(2)Each drain shall be equipped with either a water seal or a closure device in accordance with the following requirements:

(i) When a water seal is used, the water seal shall be designed such that either:

(A) The outlet to the pipe discharging the regulated-material extends below the liquid surface in the water seal of the drain; or

(B) A flexible shield or other device is installed which restricts wind motion across the open space between the outlet of the pipe discharging the regulated material and the drain.

(ii) When a closure device is used (e.g., securing a cap or plug on a drain that is not receiving regulated-material), the closure device shall be designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the drain opening and the closure device.
