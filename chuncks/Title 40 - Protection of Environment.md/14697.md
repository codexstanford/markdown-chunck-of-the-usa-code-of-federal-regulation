####### Determination of attainment

(q)-In accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, EPA has determined that Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard and that certain requirements of section 172(c) of the Clean Air Act are suspended as long as the nonattainment area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination is based upon complete, quality assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data that show the area has monitored attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the 2007 to 2009 monitoring period. Complete, quality-assured air monitoring data for 2010 are consistent with continued attainment. This determination suspends the obligation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to submit an attainment demonstration and associated reasonably available control measures (RACM), a reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, contingency measures, and other planning requirements related to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Pittsburgh Area for as long as the area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. If a violation of the1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
