####### Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.
######## Release to water.

(ii)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 90 ppb for PMNs P-92-31 and P-92-32, and N = 30 ppb for P-92-33). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง 721.90(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substance will be treated before release, then the amount of the substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 25 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.
