(a) Owners or operators of existing affected BLR sources shall operate sources such that the rate of emissions of hazardous air pollutants from all process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems combined shall not exceed 130 pounds per 1 million pounds of BLR produced.

(b) Owners or operators of new or reconstructed affected BLR sources shall reduce uncontrolled emissions from the sum of uncontrolled process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater systems by 98 percent, or limit the total emissions from these emission points to 5,000 pounds per year.

(1) For process vents, uncontrolled emissions are defined as gaseous emission streams past the last recovery device.

(2) For storage tanks, uncontrolled emissions are defined as emissions calculated according to the methodology specified in ยง 63.150(g)(3).
