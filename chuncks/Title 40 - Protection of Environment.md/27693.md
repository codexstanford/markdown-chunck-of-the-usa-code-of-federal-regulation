####### Establishing a limit under § 63.703(i) and operating parameter values.

(b)The owner or operator of an affected source subject to § 63.703 except § 63.703(b) and (h), shall establish the operating parameter value to be monitored for compliance as required by paragraph (c) of this section, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11) of this section. An owner or operator subject to § 63.703(i) shall establish a limit as required in paragraph (b)(11)(ii) of this section.

(1) Except as allowed by paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (9) of this section, for each add-on air pollution control device used to control solvent HAP emissions, the owner or operator shall fulfill the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating parameter the outlet total HAP or VOC concentration that demonstrates compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(4), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i), or (i) as appropriate; or

(ii) The owner or operator shall establish as the site-specific operating parameter the control device efficiency that demonstrates compliance with § 63.703(c)(1), (c)(4), (e)(1)(i), and (f)(1)(i).

(iii) When a nonregenerative carbon adsorber is used to comply with § 63.703(c)(1), the site-specific operating parameter value may be established as part of the design evaluation used to demonstrate initial compliance (§ 63.705(c)(6)). Otherwise, the site-specific operating parameter value shall be established during the initial performance test conducted according to the procedures of § 63.705(c)(1), (2), (3), or (4).

(2) For each condenser used as the add-on air pollution control device to comply with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i) or (i), in lieu of meeting the requirements of § 63.704(b)(1), during the initial performance test conducted according to the procedures of § 63.705(c)(1), (2), or (4), the owner or operator may establish as a site-specific operating parameter the maximum temperature of the condenser vapor exhaust stream and shall set the operating parameter value that demonstrates compliance with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i) or (i) as appropriate;

(3) For each thermal incinerator, in lieu of meeting the requirements of § 63.704(b)(1), during the initial performance test conducted according to the procedures of § 63.705(c)(1), (2), or (4), the owner or operator may establish as a site-specific operating parameter the minimum combustion temperature and set the operating parameter value that demonstrates compliance with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), or (f)(1)(i), as appropriate.

(4) For each catalytic incinerator, in lieu of meeting the requirements of § 63.704(b)(1), during the initial performance test conducted according to the procedures of § 63.705(c)(1), (2), or (4), the owner or operator may establish as site-specific operating parameters the minimum gas temperature upstream of the catalyst bed and the minimum gas temperature difference across the catalyst bed, and set the operating parameter values that demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), or (f)(1)(i), as appropriate.

(5) For each nonregenerative carbon adsorber, in lieu of meeting the requirements of § 63.704(b)(1), the owner or operator may establish as the site-specific operating parameter the carbon replacement time interval, as determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system. The carbon replacement time interval shall be established either as part of the design evaluation to demonstrate initial compliance (§ 63.705(c)(6)), or during the initial performance test conducted according to the procedures of § 63.705(c)(1), (2), (3), or (4).

(6) Each owner or operator venting solvent HAP emissions from a source through a room, enclosure, or hood, to a control device to comply with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i), or (i) shall:

(i) Submit to the Administrator with the compliance status report required by § 63.9(h) of the General Provisions a plan that:

(A) Identifies the operating parameter to be monitored to ensure that the capture efficiency measured during the initial compliance test is maintained;

(B) Discusses why this parameter is appropriate for demonstrating ongoing compliance; and

(C) Identifies the specific monitoring procedures;

(ii) Set the operating parameter value, or range of values, that demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(c), (e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(i), or (i), as appropriate; and

(iii) Conduct monitoring in accordance with the plan submitted to the Administrator unless comments received from the Administrator require an alternate monitoring scheme.

(7) For each baghouse or fabric filter used to control particulate HAP emissions in accordance with § 63.703(d)(2), the owner or operator shall establish as the site-specific operating parameter the minimum ventilation air flow rate through the inlet duct to the baghouse or fabric filter that ensures that particulate HAP are being captured and delivered to the control device. The minimum ventilation air flow rate is to be supported by the engineering calculations that are considered part of the initial performance test, as required by § 63.705(g)(2).

(8) Owners or operators subject to § 63.704(b)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) shall calculate the site-specific operating parameter value, or range of values, as the arithmetic average of the maximum and/or minimum operating parameter values, as appropriate, that demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(c), (d), (e), (f) or (i) during the multiple test runs required by § 63.705(b)(2) and (b)(1), or during the multiple runs of other tests conducted as allowed by paragraph § 63.704(b)(11).

(9) For each solvent recovery device used to comply with § 63.703(c), in lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the results of the material balance calculation conducted in accordance with § 63.705(c)(1) may serve as the site-specific operating parameter that demonstrates compliance with § 63.703(c).

(10) Owners or operators complying with the provisions of § 63.703(g) shall establish the site-specific operating parameter according to paragraph (b)(10)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) Owners or operators using a steam stripper shall establish the steam-to-feed ratio as the site-specific operating parameter, except as allowed in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section, according to the following criteria:

(A) The minimum operating parameter value shall correspond to at least the fraction removed specified in § 63.703(g)(1)(i) and be submitted to the permitting authority for approval with the design specifications required by § 63.705(h)(1); or

(B) The minimum operating parameter value shall be that value that corresponds to a total VOHAP outlet concentration in the wastewater of less than 50 ppmw as determined through tests conducted in accordance with § 63.705(b)(9) and (h)(2); or

(C) The minimum operating parameter value shall be the value that corresponds to at least the fraction removed specified in § 63.705(g)(1)(i), as demonstrated through tests conducted in accordance with § 63.705(b)(9) and (h)(3).

(ii) Owners or operators complying with § 63.703(g) through the use of a steam stripper or any other control technique may establish as a site-specific operating parameter the outlet total VOHAP concentration according to the following criteria:

(A) The minimum operating parameter value shall correspond to at least the fraction removed specified in § 63.703(g)(1)(i) and be submitted to the permitting authority for approval with the design specifications required by § 63.705(h)(1); or

(B) The minimum operating parameter value shall be a total VOHAP outlet concentration in the wastewater of less than 50 ppmw, as required by § 63.703(g)(1)(ii), and as determined through tests conducted in accordance with § 63.705 (b)(9) and (h)(2); or

(C) The minimum operating parameter value shall be the value that corresponds to at least the fraction removed specified in § 63.705(g)(1)(i), as demonstrated through tests conducted in accordance with § 63.705 (b)(9) and (h)(3).
