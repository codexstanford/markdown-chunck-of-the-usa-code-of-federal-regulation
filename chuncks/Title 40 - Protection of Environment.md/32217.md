() Develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate (kilogram/unit time) for each period of emissions to be addressed by the performance test. The emission profile shall be based on either process knowledge or test data. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the emission profile provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in the site-specific test plan required by ยง 63.1417(h)(2).
