######## Static charge.

(3)The following procedure is suggested for minimizing charge effects. Place six or more Polonium static control devices (PSCD) inside the microbalance weighing chamber, (MWC). Two of them must be placed horizontally on the floor of the MWC and the remainder placed vertically on the back wall of the MWC. Taping two PSCD's together or using double-sided tape will help to keep them from falling. Place the filter that is to be weighed on the horizontal PSCDs facing aerosol coated surface up. Close the MWC and wait 1 minute. Open the MWC and place the filter on the balance dish. Wait 1 minute. If the charges have been neutralized the weight will stabilize within 30-60 seconds. Repeat the procedure of neutralizing charges and weighing as prescribed above several times (typically 2-4 times) until consecutive weights will differ by no more than 3 micrograms. Record the last measured weight and use this value for all subsequent calculations.
