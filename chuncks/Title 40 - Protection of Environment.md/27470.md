####### Flare vent gas composition monitoring.

(j)The owner or operator shall determine the concentration of individual components in the flare vent gas using either the methods provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, to assess compliance with the operating limits in paragraph (e) of this section and, if applicable, paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to directly monitor the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(3) of this section and, if desired, may directly measure the hydrogen concentration in the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator may elect to use different monitoring methods for different gaseous streams that make up the flare vent gas using different methods provided the composition or net heating value of all gas streams that contribute to the flare vent gas are determined.
