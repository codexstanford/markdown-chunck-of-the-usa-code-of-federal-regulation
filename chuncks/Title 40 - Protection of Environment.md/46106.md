####### Turbo boost control system malfunction criteria,Turbo underboost.

(ii)-(A)The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the boost pressure control system prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's commanded boost pressure, or expected boost pressure on engines not equipped with a boost pressure control system, that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the boost pressure control system that causes a decrease in boost could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot increase boost to achieve the commanded boost pressure.
