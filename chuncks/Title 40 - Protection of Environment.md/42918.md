###### i.e.,

(a) Except as otherwise specified in § 75.21(a)(6) or (a)(7) or in section 2.3.1.2 of this appendix, perform relative accuracy test audits semiannually,once every two successive QA operating quarters (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) for each primary and redundant backup SOpollutant concentration monitor, flow monitor, COemissions concentration monitor (including Omonitors used to determine COemissions), COor Odiluent monitor used to determine heat input, moisture monitoring system, NOconcentration monitoring system, or NO-diluent CEMS. A calendar quarter that does not qualify as a QA operating quarter shall be excluded in determining the deadline for the next RATA. No more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse after the quarter in which a RATA was last performed without a subsequent RATA having been conducted. If a RATA has not been completed by the end of the eighth calendar quarter since the quarter of the last RATA, then the RATA must be completed within a 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period (as provided in section 2.3.3 of this appendix) following the end of the eighth successive elapsed calendar quarter, or data from the CEMS will become invalid.

(b) The relative accuracy test audit frequency of a CEMS may be reduced, as specified in section 2.3.1.2 of this appendix, for primary or redundant backup monitoring systems which qualify for less frequent testing. Perform all required RATAs in accordance with the applicable procedures and provisions in sections 6.5 through 6.5.2.2 of appendix A to this part and sections 2.3.1.3 and 2.3.1.4 of this appendix.

Relative accuracy test audits of primary and redundant backup SOpollutant concentration monitors, COpollutant concentration monitors (including Omonitors used to determine COemissions), COor Odiluent monitors used to determine heat input, moisture monitoring systems, NOconcentration monitoring systems, flow monitors, NO-diluent monitoring systems or SO-diluent monitoring systems may be performed annually (i.e., once every four successive QA operating quarters, rather than once every two successive QA operating quarters) if any of the following conditions are met for the specific monitoring system involved:

(a) The relative accuracy during the audit of an SOor COpollutant concentration monitor (including an Opollutant monitor used to measure COusing the procedures in appendix F to this part), or of a COor Odiluent monitor used to determine heat input, or of a NOconcentration monitoring system, or of a NO-diluent monitoring system, or of an SO-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system is &#x2264;7.5 percent;

(b) [Reserved]

(c) The relative accuracy during the audit of a flow monitor is &#x2264;7.5 percent at each operating level tested;

(d) For low flow (&#x2264;10.0 fps, as measured by the reference method during the RATA) stacks/ducts, when the flow monitor fails to achieve a relative accuracy &#x2264;7.5 percent during the audit, but the monitor mean value, calculated using Equation A-7 in appendix A to this part and converted back to an equivalent velocity in standard feet per second (fps), is within +/-1.5 fps of the reference method mean value, converted to an equivalent velocity in fps;

(e) For low SOor NOemitting units (average SOor NOreference method concentrations &#x2264;250 ppm) during the RATA, when an SOpollutant concentration monitor or NOconcentration monitoring system fails to achieve a relative accuracy &#x2264;7.5 percent during the audit, but the monitor mean value from the RATA is within +/-12 ppm of the reference method mean value;

(f) For units with low NOemission rates (average NOemission rate measured by the reference method during the RATA &#x2264;0.200 lb/mmBtu), when a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system fails to achieve a relative accuracy &#x2264;7.5 percent, but the monitoring system mean value from the RATA, calculated using Equation A-7 in appendix A to this part, is within +/-0.015 lb/mmBtu of the reference method mean value;

(g) [Reserved]

(h) For a COor Omonitor, when the mean difference between the reference method values from the RATA and the corresponding monitor values is within +/-0.7 percent COor O; and

(i) When the relative accuracy of a continuous moisture monitoring system is &#x2264;7.5 percent or when the mean difference between the reference method values from the RATA and the corresponding monitoring system values is within +/-1.0 percent HO.

(a) For SOpollutant concentration monitors, COemissions concentration monitors (including Omonitors used to determine COemissions), COor Odiluent monitors used to determine heat input, NOconcentration monitoring systems, and NO-diluent monitoring systems, the required semiannual or annual RATA tests shall be done at the load level (or operating level) designated as normal under section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part. If two load levels (or operating levels) are designated as normal, the required RATA(s) may be done at either load level (or operating level).

(b) For flow monitors installed on peaking units and bypass stacks, and for flow monitors that qualify to perform only single-level RATAs under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part, all required semiannual or annual relative accuracy test audits shall be single-load (or single-level) audits at the normal load (or operating level), as defined in section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part.

(c) For all other flow monitors, the RATAs shall be performed as follows:

(1) An annual 2-load (or 2-level) flow RATA shall be done at the two most frequently used load levels (or operating levels), as determined under section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part, or (if applicable) at the operating levels determined under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part. Alternatively, a 3-load (or 3-level) flow RATA at the low, mid, and high load levels (or operating levels), as defined under section 6.5.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part, may be performed in lieu of the 2-load (or 2-level) annual RATA.

(2) If the flow monitor is on a semiannual RATA frequency, 2-load (or 2-level) flow RATAs and single-load (or single-level) flow RATAs at the normal load level (or normal operating level) may be performed alternately.

(3) A single-load (or single-level) annual flow RATA may be performed in lieu of the 2-load (or 2-level) RATA if the results of an historical load data analysis show that in the time period extending from the ending date of the last annual flow RATA to a date that is no more than 21 days prior to the date of the current annual flow RATA, the unit (or combination of units, for a common stack) has operated at a single load level (or operating level) (low, mid, or high), for ≥85.0 percent of the time. Alternatively, a flow monitor may qualify for a single-load (or single-level) RATA if the 85.0 percent criterion is met in the time period extending from the beginning of the quarter in which the last annual flow RATA was performed through the end of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter of current annual flow RATA.

(4) A 3-load (or 3-level) RATA, at the low-, mid-, and high-load levels (or operating levels), as determined under section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, shall be performed at least once every twenty consecutive calendar quarters, except for flow monitors that are exempted from 3-load (or 3-level) RATA testing under section 6.5.2(b) or 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part.
