() Calculations which demonstrate that total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM from all heatset-web-offset lithographic printing lines at the facility never exceed 90.7 Mg (100 tons) per calendar year before the application of air pollution control equipment. Total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM for a heatset-web-offset lithographic printing facility is the sum of maximum theoretical emissions of VOM from each heatset-web-offset lithographic printing line at the facility. The following equation shall be used to calculate total maximum theoretical emissions of VOM per calendar year in the absence of air pollution control equipment for each heatset-web-offset lithographic printing line at the facility.
