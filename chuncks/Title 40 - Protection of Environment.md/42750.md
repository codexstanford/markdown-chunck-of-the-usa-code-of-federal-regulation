(E) Run end date and hour;

(F) The data in paragraphs (a)(7)(iv)(B) through (I) and (L) through (O); and (G) Stack gas density adjustment factor (if applicable).

(iii) For each hour of each reference method test run using Method 6C, 7E, or 3A in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine SO, NO, CO, or Oconcentration:

(A) Unit or stack identification number;

(B) The reference method system and component identification numbers;

(C) Run number;

(D) Run date and hour;

(E) Pollutant or diluent gas being measured;

(F) Unadjusted (raw) average pollutant or diluent gas concentration for the hour; and
