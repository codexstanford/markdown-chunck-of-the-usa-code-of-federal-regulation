####### 8.3 EC Cell Rate.

Maintain the EC cell sample flow rate so that it does not vary by more than +/-10 percent throughout the pre-sampling calibration, stack gas sampling and post-sampling calibration check. Alternatively, the EC cell sample flow rate can be maintained within a tolerance range that does not affect the gas concentration readings by more than +/-3 percent, as instructed by the EC cell manufacturer.
