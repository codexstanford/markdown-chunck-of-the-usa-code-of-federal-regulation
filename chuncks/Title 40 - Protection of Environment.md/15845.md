######## Solid particle generation.

(2)(i) Solid particle tests performed in this subpart shall be conducted using particles composed of ammonium fluorescein. For use in the VOAG, liquid solutions of known volumetric concentration can be prepared by diluting fluorescein powder (C0HO, FW = 332.31, CAS 2321-07-5) with aqueous ammonia. Guidelines for preparation of fluorescein solutions of the desired volume concentration (C) are presented by Vanderpool and Rubow (1988) (Reference 2 in appendix A of this subpart). For purposes of converting particle physical diameter to aerodynamic diameter, an ammonium fluorescein density of 1.35 g/cmshall be used.

(ii) Mass deposits of ammonium fluorescein shall be extracted and analyzed using solutions of 0.01 N ammonium hydroxide.
