####### ΔC,A

(1) If we approve it in advance, you may instead use one of the alternate methods specified in §§ 1037.528 through 1037.532, consistent with good engineering judgment, which may require that you adjust your test results from the alternate test method to correlate with the primary method. If you request our approval to determineusing an alternate method, you must submit additional information as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) The principles of 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(1) apply for aerodynamic test methods. Specifically, we may require that you use coastdown measurements if we determine that certain technologies are not suited to evaluation with wind-tunnel testing or CFD, such as nonrigid materials whose physical characteristics change in scaled-model testing. You may similarly reference 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(1) in your request to use coastdown testing as an alternate method.

(c) The following provisions apply for combining multiple devices under this section for the purpose of certifying trailers:
