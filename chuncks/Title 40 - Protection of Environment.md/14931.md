(D) Revision to General Rules, as adopted by Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) on August 16, 1993, Repeal Section 101.1 definition ofimpact.

(E) Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Commission Order Docket Number 95-0276-RUL, as adopted by Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) on March 1, 1995.

(F) Revision to Regulation VI-Control of Air Pollution by Permits for New Construction or Modification, revised 30 TAC Section 116.160(a), as adopted by Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) on March 1, 1995.

(103) Revisions to the Texas SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative Declarations. A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. This submittal satisfies section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular CTG/ACT source categories for the Texas ozone nonattainment areas stated in this paragraph (c)(103).

(i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated January 10, 1996, from the Governor of Texas to the Regional Administrator, submitting the Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan as a revision to the SIP, which included VOC RACT negative declarations.

(ii) Additional material. Pages 53, 55 through 59, 61, 63, and 64 of the Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan, adopted by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission on December 13, 1995.

(104) Revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan, submitted to the EPA in letters dated November 13, 1993, May 9, 1994, August 3, 1994, and November 14, 1994. These control measures can be found in the 15 Percent Plans for the Beaumont/Port Arthur, Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso and Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment areas. These control measures are being approved for the purpose of strengthening of the SIP.
