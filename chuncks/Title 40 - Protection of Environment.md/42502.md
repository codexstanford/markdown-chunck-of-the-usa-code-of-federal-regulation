######## Unit utilizing common stack with nonaffected unit(s).

(2)When one or more Phase I or Phase II affected units utilizes a common stack with one or more nonaffected units, the owner or operator shall either:

(i) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each Phase I and Phase II unit; or

(ii) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in the common stack; and

(A) Designate the nonaffected units as opt-in units in accordance with part 74 of this chapter and combine emissions for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; or

(B) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SOcontinuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in the duct from each nonaffected unit; determine SOmass emissions from the affected units as the difference between SOmass emissions measured in the common stack and SOmass emissions measured in the ducts of the nonaffected units, not to be reported as an hourly average value less than zero; combine emissions for the Phase I and Phase II affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; and calculate and report SOmass emissions from the Phase I and Phase II affected units, pursuant to an approach approved by the Administrator, such that these emissions are not underestimated; or

(C) Record the combined emissions from all units as the combined SOmass emissions for the Phase I and Phase II affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; or

(D) Petition through the designated representative and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning SOmass emissions measured in the common stack to each of the units using the common stack and on reporting the SOmass emissions. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning and reporting SOmass emissions measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures that there is a complete and accurate accounting of all emissions regulated under this part and, in particular, that the emissions from any affected unit are not underestimated.
