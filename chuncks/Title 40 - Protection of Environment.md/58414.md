####### Front panel statement of restricted use classification.

(i)(A) At the top of the front panel of the label, set in type of the same minimum sizes as required for human hazard signal words (see table in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section), and appearing with sufficient prominence relative to other text and graphic material on the front panel to make it unlikely to be overlooked under customary conditions of purchase and use, the statement "Restricted Use Pesticide" shall appear.

(B) Directly below this statement on the front panel, a summary statement of the terms of restriction imposed as a precondition to registration shall appear. If use is restricted to certified applicators, the following statement is required: "For retail sale to and use only by Certified Applicators or persons under their direct supervision and only for those uses covered by the Certified Applicator's certification." If, however, other regulatory restrictions are imposed, the Administrator will define the appropriate wording for the terms of restriction by regulation.
