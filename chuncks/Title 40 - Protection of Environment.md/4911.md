(nn) Intermittent control system (ICS) means a dispersion technique which varies the rate at which pollutants are emitted to the atmosphere according to meteorological conditions and/or ambient concentrations of the pollutant, in order to prevent ground-level concentrations in excess of applicable ambient air quality standards. Such a dispersion technique is an ICS whether used alone, used with other dispersion techniques, or used as a supplement to continuous emission controls (, used as a supplemental control system).
