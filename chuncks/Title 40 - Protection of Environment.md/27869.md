####### Chemical milling maskant application operation.

(e)Each owner or operator of a chemical milling maskant application operation subject to this subpart shall submit semiannual reports occurring every 6 months from the date of the notification of compliance status that identify:

(1) For chemical milling maskants where compliance is not being achieved through the use of averaging or a control device, the HAP or VOC content in manufacturer's supplied data as recorded under § 63.752(f), or each value of Hand G, as recorded under § 63.752(f)(1)(i), that exceeds the applicable organic HAP or VOC content limit specified in § 63.747(c);

(2) For chemical milling maskants where compliance is being achieved through the use of averaging, each value of Hand G, as recorded under § 63.752(f)(2)(i), that exceeds the applicable organic HAP or VOC content limit specified in § 63.747(c);

(3) Where a control device is used,

(i) If incinerators are used to comply with the standards, all periods when the 3-hour average combustion temperature(s) is (are) less than the average combustion temperature(s) established under § 63.751(b) (11) or (12) during the most recent performance test during which compliance was demonstrated;

(ii) If a carbon adsorber is used,

(A) Each rolling period when the overall control efficiency of the control system is calculated to be less than 81%, the initial material balance calculation, and any exceedances as demonstrated through the calculation; or,

(B) For nonregenerative carbon adsorbers, submit the design evaluation, the continuous monitoring system performance report, and any excess emissions as demonstrated through deviations of monitored values.

(iii) For control devices other than an incinerator or carbon adsorber, each exceedance of the operating parameter(s) established for the control device under the initial performance test during which compliance was demonstrated;

(4) All chemical milling maskants currently in use that were not listed in the notification of compliance status or any other subsequent semiannual report;

(5) Descriptions of any control devices currently in use that were not listed in the notification of compliance status or any subsequent report; and

(6) If the operations have been in compliance for the semiannual period, a statement that the chemical milling maskant application operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards.

(f) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests following the procedure specified in either paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section.
