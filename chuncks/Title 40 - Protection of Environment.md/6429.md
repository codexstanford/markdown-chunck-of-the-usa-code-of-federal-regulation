###### Preliminary traverse.

8.3.4.1You must use an S-type pitot tube with a conventional thermocouple to conduct the traverse. Conduct the preliminary traverse as close as possible to the anticipated testing time on sources that are subject to hour-by-hour gas flow rate variations of approximately +/- 20 percent and/or gas temperature variations of approximately +/- 28 &#xB0;C (+/- 50 &#xB0;F). (Note: You should be aware that these variations can cause errors in the cyclone cut diameters and the isokinetic sampling velocities.)
