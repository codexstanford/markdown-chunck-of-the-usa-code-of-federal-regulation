####### ยง 63.3167 How do I establish the add-on control device operating limits during performance tests?
######## Catalytic oxidizers.

(b)If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) or paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section.

(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.

(2) Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. The minimum 3-hour average operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer are the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production, the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. A low production period is when production is less than 80 percent of production rate during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer.

(3) As an alternative, if the latest operating permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limits for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. If you do not have an operating permit for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility and the latest construction permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limits for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. A low production period is when production is less than 80 percent of production rate during the performance test. If you use 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test as the minimum operating limits for a catalytic oxidizer, then you must keep the set point for the temperature just before the catalyst bed on that catalytic oxidizer no lower than 14 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer.

(4) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.

(5) If the latest operating permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer. If you do not have an operating permit for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility and the latest construction permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer. If you use 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test as the minimum operating limit for a catalytic oxidizer, then you must keep the set point for the temperature just before the catalyst bed on that catalytic oxidizer no lower than 14 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer.

(6) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
