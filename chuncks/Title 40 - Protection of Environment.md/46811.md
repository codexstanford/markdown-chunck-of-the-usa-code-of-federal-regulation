####### CVS System Verification.

(c)The following "gravimetric" technique can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. If the CVS and analytical system will be used only in the testing of petroleum-fueled engines, the system verification may be performed using either propane or carbon monoxide. If the CVS and analytical system will be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as well as petroleum-fueled vehicles, system verification performance check must include a methanol check in addition to either the propane or carbon monoxide check. (Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using critical flow orifice devices.)

(1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION-carbon monoxide is poisonous).

(2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.

(3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of pure propane or carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes).

(4) Following completion of step (3) in this paragraph (c) (if methanol injection is required), continue to operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a known quantity of pure methanol (in gaseous form) into the system during the sampling period (approximately five minutes). This step does not need to be performed with each verification, provided that it is performed at least twice annually.

(5) The calculations of ยง 86.144 are performed in the normal way, except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/ft/carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m/carbon atom)) is used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the density of 32.97 g/ft(1.164 kg/m) is used. In the case of methanol, the density of 37.71 g/ft(1.332 kg/m) is used.

(6) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent accuracy of the system.

(7) The cause for any discrepancy greater than +/-2 percent must be found and corrected. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, discrepancies greater than +/-2 percent are allowed for the methanol test, provided that they do not exceed +/-8 percent for 1991 testing or +/-6 percent for 1992-1995 testing.)
