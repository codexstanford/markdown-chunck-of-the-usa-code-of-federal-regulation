####### § 97.54 Compliance.
######## Deductions for compliance.

(b)(1) Following the recordation, in accordance with § 97.61, of NOallowance transfers submitted for recordation in the unit's compliance account or the overdraft account of the source where the unit is located by the NOallowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will deduct NOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section to cover the unit's NOemissions (as determined in accordance with subpart H of this part), or to account for actual heat input under § 97.42(e), for the control period:

(i) From the compliance account; and

(ii) Only if no more NOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section remain in the compliance account, from the overdraft account. In deducting allowances for units at the source from the overdraft account, the Administrator will begin with the unit having the compliance account with the lowest account number and end with the unit having the compliance account with the highest account number (with account numbers sorted beginning with the left-most character and ending with the right-most character and the letter characters assigned values in alphabetical order and less than all numeric characters).

(2) The Administrator will deduct NOallowances first under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and then under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

(i) Until the number of NOallowances deducted for the control period equals the number of tons of NOemissions, determined in accordance with subpart H of this part, from the unit for the control period for which compliance is being determined, plus the number of NOallowances required for deduction to account for actual heat input under § 97.42(e) for the control period; or

(ii) Until no more NOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section remain in the respective account.
