####### ยง 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## Criteria for determining whether the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate may be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride.

(3)An hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride is waived if you determine considering the criteria listed below that the long-term feedrate limit (and averaging period) established under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section will also ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate will not exceed the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit you calculate for each combustor.

(i) The ratio of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate based on the total chlorine emission rate you select for each hazardous waste combustor to the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for the combustor; and

(ii) The potential for the source to vary total chlorine and chloride feedrates substantially over the averaging period for the feedrate limit established under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
