###### § 60.49b Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
####### i.e.,i.e.,i.e.

(1) Identify the specific operating conditions to be monitored and the relationship between these operating conditions and NOemission rates (, ng/J or lbs/MMBtu heat input). Steam generating unit operating conditions include, but are not limited to, the degree of staged combustion (, the ratio of primary air to secondary and/or tertiary air) and the level of excess air (, flue gas Olevel);

(2) Include the data and information that the owner or operator used to identify the relationship between NOemission rates and these operating conditions; and

(3) Identify how these operating conditions, including steam generating unit load, will be monitored under § 60.48b(g) on an hourly basis by the owner or operator during the period of operation of the affected facility; the quality assurance procedures or practices that will be employed to ensure that the data generated by monitoring these operating conditions will be representative and accurate; and the type and format of the records of these operating conditions, including steam generating unit load, that will be maintained by the owner or operator under § 60.49b(g).

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall record and maintain records as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall record and maintain records of the amounts of each fuel combusted during each day and calculate the annual capacity factor individually for coal, distillate oil, residual oil, natural gas, wood, and municipal-type solid waste for the reporting period. The annual capacity factor is determined on a 12-month rolling average basis with a new annual capacity factor calculated at the end of each calendar month.

(2) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject to a federally enforceable permit restricting fuel use to a single fuel such that the facility is not required to continuously monitor any emissions (excluding opacity) or parameters indicative of emissions may elect to record and maintain records of the amount of each fuel combusted during each calendar month.

(e) For an affected facility that combusts residual oil and meets the criteria under § 60.46b(e)(4), § 60.44b(j), or (k), the owner or operator shall maintain records of the nitrogen content of the residual oil combusted in the affected facility and calculate the average fuel nitrogen content for the reporting period. The nitrogen content shall be determined using ASTM Method D4629 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or fuel suppliers. If residual oil blends are being combusted, fuel nitrogen specifications may be prorated based on the ratio of residual oils of different nitrogen content in the fuel blend.

(f) For an affected facility subject to the opacity standard in § 60.43b, the owner or operator shall maintain records of opacity. In addition, an owner or operator that elects to monitor emissions according to the requirements in § 60.48b(a) shall maintain records according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable to the visible emissions monitoring method used.

(1) For each performance test conducted using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part, the owner or operator shall keep the records including the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Dates and time intervals of all opacity observation periods;

(ii) Name, affiliation, and copy of current visible emission reading certification for each visible emission observer participating in the performance test; and

(iii) Copies of all visible emission observer opacity field data sheets;

(ii) Name and affiliation for each visible emission observer participating in the performance test;

(iii) Copies of all visible emission observer opacity field data sheets; and

(iv) Documentation of any adjustments made and the time the adjustments were completed to the affected facility operation by the owner or operator to demonstrate compliance with the applicable monitoring requirements.

(3) For each digital opacity compliance system, the owner or operator shall maintain records and submit reports according to the requirements specified in the site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator.

(g) Except as provided under paragraph (p) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the NOstandards under § 60.44b shall maintain records of the following information for each steam generating unit operating day:

(1) Calendar date;

(2) The average hourly NOemission rates (expressed as NO) (ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input) measured or predicted;

(3) The 30-day average NOemission rates (ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input) calculated at the end of each steam generating unit operating day from the measured or predicted hourly nitrogen oxide emission rates for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days;

(4) Identification of the steam generating unit operating days when the calculated 30-day average NOemission rates are in excess of the NOemissions standards under § 60.44b, with the reasons for such excess emissions as well as a description of corrective actions taken;

(5) Identification of the steam generating unit operating days for which pollutant data have not been obtained, including reasons for not obtaining sufficient data and a description of corrective actions taken;

(6) Identification of the times when emission data have been excluded from the calculation of average emission rates and the reasons for excluding data;
