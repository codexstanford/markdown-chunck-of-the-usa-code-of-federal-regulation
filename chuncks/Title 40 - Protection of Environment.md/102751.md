(7) Incrementally close the restrictor valve to decrease the absolute pressure at the inlet to the PDP,.

(8) Repeat the steps in paragraphs (e)(6) and (7) of this section to record data at a minimum of six restrictor positions ranging from the wide open restrictor position to the minimum expected pressure at the PDP inlet or the maximum expected differential (outlet minus inlet) pressure across the PDP during testing.

(9) Calibrate the PDP by using the collected data and the equations in ยง 1065.640.

(10) Repeat the steps in paragraphs (e)(6) through (9) of this section for each speed at which you operate the PDP.

(11) Use the equations in ยง 1065.642 to determine the PDP flow equation for emission testing.
