######## Purpose.,n

(b)(1)(i) The measurement and estimation of the-octanol/water partition coefficient (K), has become the cornerstone of a myriad of structure-activity relationships (SAR) property. The coefficient has been used extensively for correlating structural changes in drugs with changes observed in biological, biochemical, or toxic effects. These correlations are then used to predict the effect of a new drug for which a Kcould be measured.

(ii) In the study of the environmental fate of organic chemicals, the Khas become a key parameter. Kis correlated to water solubility, soil/sediment sorption coefficient, and bioconcentration and is important to SAR.

(iii) Of the three properties that can be estimated from K, water solubility is the most important because it affects both the fate and transport of chemicals. For example, highly soluble chemicals become quickly distributed by the hydrologic cycle, have low-sorption coefficients for soils and sediments, and tend to be more easily degraded by microorganisms. In addition, chemical transformation processes such as hydrolysis, direct photolysis, and indirect photolysis (oxidation) tend to occur more readily if a compound is soluble.
