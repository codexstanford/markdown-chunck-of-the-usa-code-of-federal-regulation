####### CFV calibration.,C,A,d,d,D,C

(e)Some CFV flow meters consist of a single venturi and some consist of multiple venturis, where different combinations of venturis are used to meter different flow rates. For CFV flow meters that consist of multiple venturis, either calibrate each venturi independently to determine a separate discharge coefficient,, for each venturi, or calibrate each combination of venturis as one venturi. In the case where you calibrate a combination of venturis, use the sum of the active venturi throat areas as, the square root of the sum of the squares of the active venturi throat diameters as, and the ratio of the venturi throat to inlet diameters as the ratio of the square root of the sum of the active venturi throat diameters () to the diameter of the common entrance to all the venturis. (). To determine thefor a single venturi or a single combination of venturis, perform the following steps:
