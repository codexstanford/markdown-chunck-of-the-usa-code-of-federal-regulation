###### ยง 146.65 Construction requirements.
####### Tubing and packer.

(d)(1) All Class I hazardous waste injection wells shall inject fluids through tubing with a packer set at a point specified by the Director.

(2) In determining and specifying requirements for tubing and packer, the following factors shall be considered:

(i) Depth of setting;

(ii) Characteristics of injection fluid (chemical content, corrosiveness, temperature and density);

(iii) Injection pressure;

(iv) Annular pressure;

(v) Rate (intermittent or continuous), temperature and volume of injected fluid;

(vi) Size of casing; and

(vii) Tubing tensile, burst, and collapse strengths.

(3) The Director may approve the use of a fluid seal if he determines that the following conditions are met:

(i) The operator demonstrates that the seal will provide a level of protection comparable to a packer;

(ii) The operator demonstrates that the staff is, and will remain, adequately trained to operate and maintain the well and to identify and interpret variations in parameters of concern;

(iii) The permit contains specific limitations on variations in annular pressure and loss of annular fluid;

(iv) The design and construction of the well allows continuous monitoring of the annular pressure and mass balance of annular fluid; and

(v) A secondary system is used to monitor the interface between the annulus fluid and the injection fluid and the permit contains requirements for testing the system every three months and recording the results.
