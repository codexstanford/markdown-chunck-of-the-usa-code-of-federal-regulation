###### Breakthrough volume and associated relation to passive sampling.,i.e.,i.e.

3.2Breakthrough volumes, as applied to active sorbent tube sampling, equate to the volume of air containing a constant concentration of analyte that may be passed through a sorbent tube at a given temperature before a detectable level (5 percent) of the input analyte concentration elutes from the tube. Although breakthrough volumes are directly related to active rather than passive sampling, they provide a measure of the strength of the sorbent-sorbate interaction and therefore also relate to the efficiency of the passive sampling process. The best direct measure of passive sampling efficiency is the stability of the uptake rate. Quantitative passive sampling is compromised when the sorbent no longer acts as a perfect sink-, when the concentration of a target analyte immediately above the sorbent sampling surface no longer approximates to zero. This causes a reduction in the uptake rate over time. If the uptake rate for a given analyte on a given sorbent tube remains relatively constant -, if the uptake rate determined for 48 hours is similar to that determined for 7 or 14 days-the user can be confident that passive sampling is occurring at a constant rate. As a general rule of thumb, such ideal passive sampling conditions typically exist for analyte:sorbent combinations where the breakthrough volume exceeds 100 L (Reference 4).
