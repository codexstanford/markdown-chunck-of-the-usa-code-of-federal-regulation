####### Methods of release detection for field-constructed tanks.

(1)Owners and operators of field-constructed tanks with a capacity less than or equal to 50,000 gallons must meet the release detection requirements in subpart D of this part. Owners and operators of field-constructed tanks with a capacity greater than 50,000 gallons must meet either the requirements in subpart D (except ยง 280.43(e) and (f) must be combined with inventory control as stated below) or use one or a combination of the following alternative methods of release detection:

(i) Conduct an annual tank tightness test that can detect a 0.5 gallon per hour leak rate;

(ii) Use an automatic tank gauging system to perform release detection at least every 30 days that can detect a leak rate less than or equal to one gallon per hour. This method must be combined with a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate performed at least every three years;

(iii) Use an automatic tank gauging system to perform release detection at least every 30 days that can detect a leak rate less than or equal to two gallons per hour. This method must be combined with a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate performed at least every two years;

(iv) Perform vapor monitoring (conducted in accordance with ยง 280.43(e) for a tracer compound placed in the tank system) capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years;

(v) Perform inventory control (conducted in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 4140.25; ATA Airport Fuel Facility Operations and Maintenance Guidance Manual; or equivalent procedures) at least every 30 days that can detect a leak equal to or less than 0.5 percent of flow-through; and

(A) Perform a tank tightness test that can detect a 0.5 gallon per hour leak rate at least every two years; or

(B) Perform vapor monitoring or groundwater monitoring (conducted in accordance with ยง 280.43(e) or (f), respectively, for the stored regulated substance) at least every 30 days; or

(vi) Another method approved by the implementing agency if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. In comparing methods, the implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability of detection.
