####### Lean-on-cruise" calibration strategies.

(4) "Manufacturers may use "lean-on-cruise" strategies subject to the following specifications:

(i) A "lean-on-cruise" strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio significantly leaner than stoichiometry during non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph.

(ii) You must not employ "lean-on-cruise" strategies during vehicle operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of the following conditions is met:

(A) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP, US06, or SC03 duty cycle.

(B) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce vehicle emission control effectiveness over the operating conditions in which they are employed.

(C) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware.

(iii) If you propose to use a "lean-on-cruise" strategy, you must describe in the application for certification the circumstances under which such a calibration would be used and the reasons for using it.
