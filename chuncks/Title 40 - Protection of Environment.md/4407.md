9.1 Calibration of the high volume sampler's flow indicating or control device is necessary to establish traceability of the field measurement to a primary standard via a flow rate transfer standard. Figure 3a illustrates the certification of the flow rate transfer standard and Figure 3b illustrates its use in calibrating a sampler flow indicator. Determination of the corrected flow rate from the sampler flow indicator, illustrated in Figure 3c, is addressed in Section 10.1
