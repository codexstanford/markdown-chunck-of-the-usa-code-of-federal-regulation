####### ยง 1065.298 Correcting real-time PM measurement based on gravimetric PM filter measurement for field-testing analysis.
######## Correction.

(e)Develop a multiplicative correction factor to ensure that total PM measured by photoacoustic or electrical aerosol instruments equate to the gravimetric filter-based total PM measurement. Calculate the correction factor by dividing the mass of PM captured on the gravimetric filter by the quantity represented by the total concentration of PM measured by the instrument multiplied by the time over the test interval multiplied by the gravimetric filter sample flow rate.
