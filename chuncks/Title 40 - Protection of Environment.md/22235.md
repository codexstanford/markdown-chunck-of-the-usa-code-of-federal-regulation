###### e.g.,

6.1.1.1 Probe Nozzle. Borosilicate or quartz glass with a sharp, tapered leading edge and coupled to the probe liner using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or glass-lined union (fused silica, Slico, or equivalent). When the stack temperature exceeds 210 &#xB0;C (410 &#xB0;F), a leak-free ground glass fitting or other leak free, non-contaminating fitting must be used to couple the nozzle to the probe liner. It is also acceptable to use a one-piece glass nozzle/liner assembly. The angle of the taper shall be &#x2264;30&#xB0;, and the taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (toin) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (in). Larger nozzles sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains are used.

6.1.1.2 Probe Liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass, with a heating system to prevent visible condensation during sampling. Do not use metal probe liners.
