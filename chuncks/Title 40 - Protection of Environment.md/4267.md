() The optical density of this species is determined spectrophotometrically at 548 nm and is directly related to the amount of SOcollected. The total volume of air sampled, corrected to EPA reference conditions (25 &#xB0;C, 760 mm Hg [101 kPa]), is determined from the measured flow rate and the sampling time. The concentration of SOin the ambient air is computed and expressed in micrograms per standard cubic meter (Âµg/std m).
