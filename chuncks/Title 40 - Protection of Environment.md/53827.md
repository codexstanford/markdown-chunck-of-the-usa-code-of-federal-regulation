####### Technical feasibility.

(i)An evaluation of the technical feasibility of closed-cycle recirculating systems as defined at 40 CFR 125.92(c), fine mesh screens with a mesh size of 2 millimeters or smaller, and water reuse or alternate sources of cooling water. In addition, this study must include:

(A) A description of all technologies and operational measures considered (including alternative designs of closed-cycle recirculating systems such as natural draft cooling towers, mechanical draft cooling towers, hybrid designs, and compact or multi-cell arrangements);

(B) A discussion of land availability, including an evaluation of adjacent land and acres potentially available due to generating unit retirements, production unit retirements, other buildings and equipment retirements, and potential for repurposing of areas devoted to ponds, coal piles, rail yards, transmission yards, and parking lots;

(C) A discussion of available sources of process water, grey water, waste water, reclaimed water, or other waters of appropriate quantity and quality for use as some or all of the cooling water needs of the facility; and

(D) Documentation of factors other than cost that may make a candidate technology impractical or infeasible for further evaluation.
