Method 3A is a procedure for measuring oxygen (O) and carbon dioxide (CO) in stationary source emissions using a continuous instrumental analyzer. Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect data of known quality. You must document your adherence to these specific requirements for equipment, supplies, sample collection and analysis, calculations, and data analysis.

This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling and analytical procedures you will need but refers to other methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional test methods which are found in appendix A to this part:

(a) Method 1-Sample and Velocity Traverses for Stationary Sources.

(b) Method 3-Gas Analysis for the Determination of Molecular Weight.

(c) Method 4-Determination of Moisture Content in Stack Gases.

(d) Method 7E-Determination of Nitrogen Oxides Emissions from Stationary Sources (Instrumental Analyzer Procedure).
