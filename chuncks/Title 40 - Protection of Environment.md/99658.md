####### Default deterioration factors for greenhouse gas standards.

(g)You may use default deterioration factors (DFs) without performing your own durability emission tests or engineering analysis as follows:

(1) You may use a default additive DF of 0.0 g/hp&#xB7;hr for COemissions from engines that do not use advanced or off-cycle technologies. If we determine it to be consistent with good engineering judgment, we may allow you to use a default additive DF of 0.0 g/hp&#xB7;hr for COemissions from your engines with advanced or off-cycle technologies.

(2) You may use a default additive DF of 0.010 g/hp&#xB7;hr for NO emissions from any engine through model year 2021, and 0.020 g/hp&#xB7;hr for later model years.

(3) You may use a default additive DF of 0.020 g/hp&#xB7;hr for CHemissions from any engine.
