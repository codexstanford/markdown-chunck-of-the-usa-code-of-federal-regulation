###### Interferant.

3.6A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared spectrum overlaps at least part of an analyte spectrum complicating the analyte measurement. The interferant may not prevent the analyte measurement, but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured concentration. Reference spectra of interferants are used to distinguish the interferant bands from the analyte bands. An interferant for one analyte may not be an interferant for other analytes.
