###### ยง 796.3500 Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25 &#xB0;C.
####### Effect of acidic and basic groups.

(viii)Complications can arise upon measuring the rate of hydrolysis of chemicals that reversibly ionize or are protonated in the pH range 3.00 to 11.00. Therefore, for these chemicals, it is recommended that these hydrolysis tests be performed at pH 5.00, 7.00, and 900 +/-0.05 using the appropriate buffers described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. If a test chemical reversibly ionizes or protonates in the pH range 5.00 to 9.00, then it is recommended that additional hydrolysis tests should be carried out at pH 6.00 and 8.00 +/-0.05 using the buffers described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
