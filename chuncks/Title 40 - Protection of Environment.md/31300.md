####### Halogenated emissions.

(c)Halogenated Group 1 batch process vents, halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, and halogenated continuous process vents that are combusted as part of complying with paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, as appropriate, shall be controlled according to either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.

(1) If a combustion device is used to comply with paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section for a halogenated batch process vent, halogenated aggregate batch vent stream, or halogenated continuous process vent, said emissions exiting the combustion device shall be ducted to a halogen reduction device that reduces overall emissions of hydrogen halides and halogens by at least 99 percent before discharge to the atmosphere.

(2) A halogen reduction device may be used to reduce the halogen atom mass emission rate of said emissions to less than 3,750 kg/yr for batch process vents or aggregate batch vent streams and to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour for continuous process vents prior to venting to any combustion control device, and thus make the batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, or continuous process vent nonhalogenated. The nonhalogenated batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, or continuous process vent shall then comply with the requirements of either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.

(d) If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, the batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, or continuous process vent shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.
