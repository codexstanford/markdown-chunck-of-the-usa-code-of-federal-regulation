###### § 63.703 Standards.

(a) Each owner or operator of any affected source that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of this subpart on and after the compliance dates specified in § 63.701.

(b)(1) The owner or operator subject to § 63.701(a)(2) shall determine limits on the amount of HAP utilized (see definition) in the magnetic tape manufacturing operation as the values for the potential to emit HAP from the magnetic tape manufacturing operation.

(2) The limits on the amount of HAP utilized in the magnetic tape manufacturing operations shall be determined in the following manner.

(i) The potential to emit each HAP from each emission point at the stationary source, other than those from magnetic tape manufacturing operations, shall be calculated and converted to the units of Mg/yr (or tons/yr).

(ii) The limits on the HAP utilized in the magnetic tape manufacturing operation shall be determined as the values that, when summed with the values in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, are less than 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tons/yr) for each individual HAP and 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) for the combination of HAP.

(3) The limits on the HAP utilized determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be in terms of Mg/yr (or tons/yr), calculated monthly on a rolling 12-month average. The owner or operator shall not exceed these limits.

(4) An owner or operator subject to paragraph (b) of this section shall meet the requirements in paragraph (h) of this section.

(5) A magnetic tape manufacturing operation that is subject to paragraph (b) of this section and is located at an area source is not subject to paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

(c) Except as provided by § 63.703(b), each owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart shall limit gaseous HAP emitted from each solvent storage tank, piece of mix preparation equipment, coating operation, waste handling device, and condenser vent in solvent recovery as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section:

(1) Except as otherwise allowed in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, each owner or operator shall limit gaseous HAP emitted from each solvent storage tank, piece of mix preparation equipment, coating operation, waste handling device, and condenser vent in solvent recovery by an overall HAP control efficiency of at least 95 percent.

(2) An owner or operator that uses an incinerator to control emission points listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may choose to meet the overall HAP control efficiency requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or may operate the incinerator such that an outlet HAP concentration of no greater than 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) by compound on a dry basis is achieved, as long as the efficiency of the capture system is 100 percent.

(3) An owner or operator may choose to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section by venting the room, building, or enclosure in which the HAP emission point is located to an add-on air pollution control device, as long as the required overall HAP control efficiency of this method is sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

(4) In lieu of controlling HAP emissions from each solvent storage tank and piece of mix preparation equipment to the level required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an owner or operator of an affected source may elect to comply with one of the options set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section.
