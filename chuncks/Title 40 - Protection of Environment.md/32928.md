######## Combustion zone

means the space in an enclosed combustion device (e.g., vapor incinerator, boiler, furnace, or process heater) occupied by the organic HAP and any supplemental fuel while burning. The combustion zone includes any flame that is visible or luminous as well as that space outside the flame envelope in which the organic HAP continues to be oxidized to form the combustion products.
