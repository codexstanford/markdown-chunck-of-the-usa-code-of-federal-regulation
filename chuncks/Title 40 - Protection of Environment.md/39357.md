######## Tier 3 requirements for opacities exceeding 20 percent.

(7)For each visual determination of emissions opacity performed in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of this section for which the average of the six-minute average opacities recorded exceeds 20 percent, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(7)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) You must submit a report of exceedence of 20 percent opacity, along with your annual certification and compliance report, as specified in § 63.11519(b)(8), "Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements," and according to the requirements of § 63.11519(b)(1), "Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements."
