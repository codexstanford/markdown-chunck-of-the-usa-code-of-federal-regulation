Where a vehicle other than water is used to generate an appropriate concentration of the test substance in the atmosphere and historical data are not available or adequate to determine the acute toxicity of the vehicle, a vehicle control group must be used.

Except for treatment with the test substance, animals in the vehicle control group must be handled in a manner identical to the test-group animals.
