####### Manure composting

means the biological oxidation of a solid waste including manure usually with bedding or another organic carbon source typically at thermophilic temperatures produced by microbial heat production. There are four types of composting employed for manure management: Static, in vessel, intensive windrow and passive windrow. Static composting typically occurs in an enclosed channel, with forced aeration and continuous mixing. In vessel composting occurs in piles with forced aeration but no mixing. Intensive windrow composting occurs in windrows with regular turning for mixing and aeration. Passive windrow composting occurs in windrows with infrequent turning for mixing and aeration.
