###### ยง 1036.125 Maintenance instructions and allowable maintenance.

Maintenance includes any inspection, adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of components and is classified as either emission-related or not emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance. Give the ultimate purchaser of each new engine written instructions for maintaining and using the engine. As described in paragraph (h) of this section, these instructions must identify how owners properly maintain and use engines to clarify responsibilities for regulatory requirements such as emission-related warranty and defect reporting.
