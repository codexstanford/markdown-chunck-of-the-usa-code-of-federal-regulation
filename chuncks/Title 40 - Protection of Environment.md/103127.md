####### Venturi governing equations and permissible assumptions.,r,i.e., r,r,Z,C,C,C,&#x3B3;

(c)This section describes the governing equations and permissible assumptions for calibrating a venturi and calculating flow using a venturi. Because a subsonic venturi (SSV) and a critical-flow venturi (CFV) both operate similarly, their governing equations are nearly the same, except for the equation describing their pressure ratio,(versus). These governing equations assume one-dimensional isentropic inviscid flow of an ideal gas. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section describes other assumptions that may apply. If good engineering judgment dictates that you account for gas compressibility, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values ofas a function of measured pressure and temperature, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment. Note that the equation for the flow coefficient,, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent,, is equal to the ratio of specific heats,/If good engineering judgment dictates using a real gas isentropic exponent, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values ofas a function of measured pressures and temperatures, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment.
