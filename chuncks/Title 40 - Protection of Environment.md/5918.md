####### Leak check.

(c)A system leak check shall be performed within twenty-four hours before the test in low volume stations (those performing less than the 4,000 inspections per year) and within four hours in high-volume stations (4,000 or more inspections per year) and may be performed in conjunction with the gas calibration described in paragraph (I)(d)(1) of this appendix. If a leak check is not performed within the preceding twenty-four hours in low volume stations and within four hours in high-volume stations or if the analyzer fails the leak check, the analyzer shall lock out from testing. The leak check shall be a procedure demonstrated to effectively check the sample hose and probe for leaks and shall be performed in accordance with good engineering practices. An error of more than +/-2% of the reading using low range span gas shall cause the analyzer to lock out from testing and shall require repair of leaks.
