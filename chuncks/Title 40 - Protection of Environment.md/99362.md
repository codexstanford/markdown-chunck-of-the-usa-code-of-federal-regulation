(4) Identify the value ofin each application for the certification for which it applies.

(5) Apply the provisions for ramped-modal testing based on measurements for each test interval rather than the whole ramped-modal test.

(b) You may ask us to approve an alternate methodology to account for regeneration events. We will generally limit approval to cases where your engines use aftertreatment technology with extremely infrequent regeneration and you are unable to apply the provisions of this section.

(c) You may choose to make no adjustments to measured emission results if you determine that regeneration does not significantly affect emission levels for an engine family (or configuration) or if it is not practical to identify when regeneration occurs. If you choose not to make adjustments under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, your locomotives must meet emission standards for all testing, without regard to regeneration.
