####### Toxicological studies.

(a)(1) The results of a study of the toxicity of a pesticide to humans or other non-target domestic organisms if, relative to all previously submitted studies, they show an adverse effect under any of the following conditions:

(i) That is in a different organ or tissue of the test organism.

(ii) At a lower dosage, or after a shorter exposure period, or after a shorter latency period.

(iii) At a higher incidence or frequency.

(iv) In a different species, strain, sex, or generation of test organism.

(v) By a different route of exposure.

(2) Acute oral, acute dermal, acute inhalation or skin and eye irritation studies in which the only change in toxicity is a numerical decrease in the median lethal dose (LD), median lethal concentration (LC) or irritation indices, are not reportable under this part unless the results indicate a more restrictive toxicity category for labeling under the criteria of 40 CFR 156.62.
