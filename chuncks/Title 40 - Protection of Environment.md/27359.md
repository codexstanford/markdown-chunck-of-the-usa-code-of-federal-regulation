() Procedures for calculating the percentage of reduction of pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(3) Emissions from storage vessels shall be calculated as specified in ยง 63.150(g)(3) of subpart G.

(4) Emissions from gasoline loading racks shall be calculated as follows:

(i) The following equation shall be used for each gasoline loading rack i to calculate EGLR:

(ii) The following equation shall be used for each gasoline loading rack i to calculate the weighted average rack partial pressure:

(iii) The following equation shall be used for each gasoline loading rack i to calculate the weighted average rack molecular weight:

(iv) The following equation shall be used for each gasoline loading rack i to calculate the monthly weighted rack bulk liquid loading temperature:

(v) The following equation shall be used to calculate EGLR:

(vi) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate EGLR:

(A) If the gasoline loading rack is not controlled, EGLR= EGLR, where EGLRis calculated using the equations specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (g)(4)(iv) of this section.

(B) If the gasoline loading rack is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure not achieving the requirement of less than 10 milligrams of TOC per liter of gasoline loaded,
