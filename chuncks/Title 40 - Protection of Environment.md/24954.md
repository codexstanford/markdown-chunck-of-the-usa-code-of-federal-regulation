###### § 62.16714 Standards for municipal solid waste landfill emissions.
####### Emissions.

(e)The owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must either install a collection and control system as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or calculate an initial NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 62.16718(a). The NMOC emission rate must be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 62.16724(c)(3).

(1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must:

(i) Submit an annual NMOC emission rate report according to § 62.16724(c), except as provided in § 62.16724(c)(3); and

(ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in § 62.16724(a) until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.

(A) If the calculated NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual recalculation required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either: Comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in § 62.16718; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 62.16718(a)(6).

(B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided in § 62.16724(f), except for exemption allowed under § 62.16711(g)(4).

(2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either: Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year as specified in § 62.16724(d), except for exemptions allowed under § 62.16711(g)(3); calculate NMOC emissions using a higher tier in § 62.16718; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 62.16718(a)(6).

(3) For the closed landfill subcategory, if the calculated NMOC emission rate submitted under previously applicable regulations 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either: submit a collection and control system design plan as specified in § 62.16724(d), except for exemptions allowed under § 62.16711(g)(3); or calculate NMOC emissions using a higher tier in § 62.16718.
