12.4.2 Average Pollutant Rates from Other than Hourly Averages. When pollutant rates are determined from measured values representing longer than 1-hour periods (daily fuel sampling and analyses or Method 6B values), or when pollutant rates are determined from combinations of 1-hour and longer than 1-hour periods (CEMS and Method 6B values), compute the average pollutant rate (E) for the performance test period (30 days) specified in the applicable regulation using the following equation:

12.4.3 Daily Geometric Average Pollutant Rates from Hourly Values. The geometric average pollutant rate (E) is computed using the following equation:

12.5 Determination of Overall Reduction in Potential Sulfur Dioxide Emission.

12.5.1 Overall Percent Reduction. Compute the overall percent SOreduction (%R) using the following equation:
