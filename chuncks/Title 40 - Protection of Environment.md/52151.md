####### Destruction device performance testing.

(g)If you vent or otherwise feed fluorinated GHGs into a destruction device and apply the destruction efficiency of the device to one or more fluorinated GHGs in ยง 98.123, you must conduct emissions testing to determine the destruction efficiency for each fluorinated GHG to which you apply the destruction efficiency. You must either determine the destruction efficiency for the most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG fed into the device (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy) and apply that destruction efficiency to all the fluorinated GHGs fed into the device or alternatively determine different destruction efficiencies for different groups of fluorinated GHGs using the most-difficult-to-destroy fluorinated GHG of each group (or a surrogate that is still more difficult to destroy).
