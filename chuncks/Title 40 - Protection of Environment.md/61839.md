(a)Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide spinetoram, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of XDE-175-J: 1--indaceno[3,2-d]oxacyclododecin-7,15-dione,2-[(6deoxy-3-O-ethyl-2,4-di--methyl-&#x3B1;--mannopyranosyl)oxy]-13-[[(256)-5(dimethylamino)tetrahydro-6-methyl-2-pyran-2-yl]oxy]-9-ethyl-2,3,3a,4,5,5a,5b,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,16a,16b-hexadecahydro-14-methyl-,(23a5a5b9131416a16b); XDE-175-L: 1-indaceno[3,2-d]oxacyclododecin-7,15-dione,2-[(6deoxy-3--ethyl-2,4-di--methyl-&#x3B1;--mannopyranosyl)oxy]-13-[[(256)-5(dimethylamino)tetrahydro-6-methyl-2-pyran-2-yl]oxy]-9-ethyl-2,3,3a,5a,5b,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,16a,16b-tetradecahydro-4,14-dimethyl-,(23a5a5b9131416a16b); ND-J: (23a5a5b9131416a16b)-9-ethyl-14-methyl-13[[(256R)-6-methyl-5-(methylamino)tetrahydro-2-pyran-2-yl]oxy]-7,15-dioxo2,3,3a,4,5,5a,5b,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16a,16b-octadecahydro-1-indaceno[3,2d]oxacyclododecin-2-yl-6-deoxy-3--ethyl-2,4-di--methyl-&#x3B1;--mannopyranoside; and NF-J: (236)-6-([(23a5a5b9131416a16b)-2-[(6-deoxy-3--ethyl-2,4-di--methyl-&#x3B1;--mannopyranosyl)oxy]-9-ethyl-14-methyl-7,15-dioxo-2,3,3a,4,5,5a,5b,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16a,16b-octadecahydro-1-indaceno[3,2d]oxacyclododecin-13-yl]oxy)-2-methyltetrahydro-2-pyran-3-yl(methyl)formamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spinetoram.
