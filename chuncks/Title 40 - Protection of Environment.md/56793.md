####### Timing.

(4)States shall report quarterly, in a format and on a schedule prescribed by the Administrator, the following information related to each system's compliance with the treatment techniques for lead and copper under 40 CFR part 141, subpart I, during the preceding calendar quarter. Specifically, States shall report as follows:

(i) States shall report the name and PWS identification number:

(A) Each public water system which exceeded the lead and copper action levels and the date upon which the exceedance occurred;

(B) Each public water system required to complete the corrosion control evaluation specified in § 141.82(c) and the date the State received the results of the evaluations from each system;

(C) Each public water system for which the State has designated optimal corrosion control treatment under § 141.82(d), the date of the determination, and each system that completed installation of treatment as certified under § 141.90(c)(3);

(D) Each public water system for which the State has designated optimal water quality parameters under § 141.82(f) and the date of the determination;

(E) Each public water system which the State has required to install source water treatment under § 141.83(b)(2), the date of the determination, and each system that completed installation of treatment as certified under § 141.90(d)(2);

(F) Each public water system for which the State has specified maximum permissible source water levels under § 141.83(b)(4); and

(G) Each public water system required to begin replacing lead service lines as specified in § 141.84, each public water system for which the State has established a replacement schedule under § 141.84(f), and each system reporting compliance with its replacement schedule under § 141.90(e)(2).

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) States shall report the PWS identification number of each public water system identified in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section.

(A) For each public water system, regardless of size, all 90th percentile lead levels calculated during each tap sampling period specified in § 141.86 of this chapter, and the first and last days of the tap sampling period for which the 90th percentile lead level was calculated;

(B) For each public water system (regardless of size), the 90th percentile copper level calculated during each monitoring period in which the system exceeds the copper action level, and the first and last days of each monitoring period in which an exceedance occurred;

(C) For each public water system for which the State has designated optimal water quality parameters under § 141.82(f) of this chapter, or which the State has deemed to have optimized corrosion control under § 141.81(b)(1) or (3) of this chapter, the date of the determination and the paragraph(s) under which the State made its determination, the corrosion control treatment status of the water system, and the water system's optimal water quality parameters;

(D) For each public water system, the number of lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and lead status unknown service lines in its distribution system, reported separately;

(E) For each public water system required to begin replacing lead service lines after a lead trigger level or action level exceedance, as specified in § 141.84 of this chapter, the goal or mandatory replacement rate, and the date each system must begin replacement;

(F) For each public water system that has implemented optimal corrosion control, completed applicable source water treatment requirements pursuant to § 141.83 of this chapter and/or completed lead service line replacement requirements pursuant to § 141.84 of this chapter, and the date of the State's determination that these requirements have been met. The date reported shall be the latest of the following events:
