(2)The following requirements apply for fuel-line fittings that will be used with fuel lines that must meet permeation emission standards:

(i) Use good engineering judgment to ensure that all fuel-line fittings will remain securely connected to prevent fuel leakage throughout the useful life of the equipment.
