() If the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the NOallowances allocated to the NOBudget unit (as a NOBudget opt-in source) under § 96.88 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.

(B) The NOauthorized account representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the unit is located, includes the NOallowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NOallowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOallowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOallowances are recorded in either account.

(iii)(A) For every control period during which the NOBudget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is effective, the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be treated, solely for purposes of NOallowance allocations under § 96.42, as a unit that commenced operation on the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated NOallowances under § 96.42.

(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the effective date of the NOBudget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the following number of NOallowances will be allocated to the NOBudget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section under § 96.42 for the control period: the number of NOallowances otherwise allocated to the NOBudget unit under § 96.42 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.

(2)(i) When the NOauthorized account representative of a NOBudget opt-in source does not renew its NOBudget opt-in permit under § 96.83(b), the Administrator will deduct from the NOBudget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the NOBudget opt-in source is located, NOallowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any NOallowances allocated to the NOBudget opt-in source under § 96.88 for any control period after the last control period for which the NOBudget opt-in permit is effective. The NOauthorized account representative shall ensure that the NOBudget opt-in source's compliance account or the overdraft account of the NOBudget source where the NOBudget opt-in source is located includes the NOallowances necessary for completion of such deduction. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NOallowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOallowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOallowances are recorded in either account.

(ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is completed, the Administrator will close the NOBudget opt-in source's compliance account. If any NOallowances remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and any deduction under § 96.54, the Administrator will close the NOBudget opt-in source's compliance account and will establish, and transfer any remaining allowances to, a new general account for the owners and operators of the NOBudget opt-in source. The NOauthorized account representative for the NOBudget opt-in source shall become the NOauthorized account representative for the general account.
