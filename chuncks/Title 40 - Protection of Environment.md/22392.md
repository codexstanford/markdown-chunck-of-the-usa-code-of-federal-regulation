###### 13.7 Tune.

The groups of monitored ions are listed in Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method, as applicable for the target compound class. Tune the instrument to meet the required resolving power in Section 10.2.1 for the desired target compound class. Assess the resolution at three exact m/z's representing the low-, mid-, and high-m/z range of the masses used to measure the target compound class. You may use peak matching and the chosen PFK (or FC43) reference peak to verify that the exact mass is within 5 ppm of the required value.
