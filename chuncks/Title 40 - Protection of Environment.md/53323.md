####### et seq.

(1) For the owner or operator of a facility in operation on or before February 18, 1993 who is required to prepare and submit a response plan under 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-380, 33 U.S.C. 2701) requires the submission of a response plan that satisfies the requirements of 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5) no later than February 18, 1993.

(i) The owner or operator of an existing facility that was in operation on or before February 18, 1993 who submitted a response plan by February 18, 1993 shall revise the response plan to satisfy the requirements of this section and resubmit the response plan or updated portions of the response plan to the Regional Administrator by February 18, 1995.

(ii) The owner or operator of an existing facility in operation on or before February 18, 1993 who failed to submit a response plan by February 18, 1993 shall prepare and submit a response plan that satisfies the requirements of this section to the Regional Administrator before August 30, 1994.

(2) The owner or operator of a facility in operation on or after August 30, 1994 that satisfies the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or that is notified by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall prepare and submit a facility response plan that satisfies the requirements of this section to the Regional Administrator.

(i) For a facility that commenced operations after February 18, 1993 but prior to August 30, 1994, and is required to prepare and submit a response plan based on the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the response plan or updated portions of the response plan, along with a completed version of the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part, to the Regional Administrator prior to August 30, 1994.

(ii) For a newly constructed facility that commences operation after August 30, 1994, and is required to prepare and submit a response plan based on the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the response plan, along with a completed version of the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part, to the Regional Administrator prior to the start of operations (adjustments to the response plan to reflect changes that occur at the facility during the start-up phase of operations must be submitted to the Regional Administrator after an operational trial period of 60 days).

(iii) For a facility required to prepare and submit a response plan after August 30, 1994, as a result of a planned change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance that renders the facility subject to the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the response plan, along with a completed version of the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part, to the Regional Administrator before the portion of the facility undergoing change commences operations (adjustments to the response plan to reflect changes that occur at the facility during the start-up phase of operations must be submitted to the Regional Administrator after an operational trial period of 60 days).

(iv) For a facility required to prepare and submit a response plan after August 30, 1994, as a result of an unplanned event or change in facility characteristics that renders the facility subject to the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the response plan, along with a completed version of the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part, to the Regional Administrator within six months of the unplanned event or change.

(3) In the event the owner or operator of a facility that is required to prepare and submit a response plan uses an alternative formula that is comparable to one contained in appendix C to this part to evaluate the criterion in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the owner or operator shall attach documentation to the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part that demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness of the alternative formula.
