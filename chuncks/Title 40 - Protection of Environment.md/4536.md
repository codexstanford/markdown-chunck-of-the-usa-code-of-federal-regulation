1.1 This method provides for the measurement of the mass concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM) in ambient air over a 24-hour period for purposes of determining attainment and maintenance of the primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter specified in ยง 50.6 of this chapter. The measurement process is nondestructive, and the PMsample can be subjected to subsequent physical or chemical analyses. Quality assurance procedures and guidance are provided in part 58, appendices A and B, of this chapter and in References 1 and 2.
