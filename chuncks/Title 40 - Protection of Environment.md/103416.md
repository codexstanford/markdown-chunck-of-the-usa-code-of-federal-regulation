####### Linearity,a,a,r,SEE,

means the degree to which measured values agree with respective reference values. Linearity is quantified using a linear regression of pairs of measured values and reference values over a range of values expected or observed during testing. Perfect linearity would result in an intercept,equal to zero, a slope,of one, a coefficient of determination,, of one, and a standard error of the estimate,of zero. The term "linearity" is not used in this part to refer to the shape of a measurement instrument's unprocessed response curve, such as a curve relating emission concentration to voltage output. A properly performing instrument with a nonlinear response curve will meet linearity specifications.
