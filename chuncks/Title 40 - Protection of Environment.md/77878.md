##### Subpart F - Procedures for Determining Manufacturer's Average Fuel Economy and Manufacturer's Average Carbon-Related Exhaust Emissions
###### § 600.510-12 Calculation of average fuel economy and average carbon-related exhaust emissions.

(a)(1) Average fuel economy will be calculated to the nearest 0.1 mpg for the categories of automobiles identified in this section, and the results of such calculations will be reported to the Secretary of Transportation for use in determining compliance with the applicable fuel economy standards.

(i) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of passenger automobiles as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. For example, categories may include, but are not limited to domestically manufactured and/or non-domestically manufactured passenger automobiles as determined by the Secretary of Transportation.

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of trucks as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. For example, categories may include, but are not limited to domestically manufactured trucks, non-domestically manufactured trucks, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles, and/or heavy-duty trucks as determined by the Secretary of Transportation.

(iv) [Reserved]

(2) Average carbon-related exhaust emissions will be calculated to the nearest one gram per mile for the categories of automobiles identified in this section, and the results of such calculations will be reported to the Administrator for use in determining compliance with the applicable COemission standards.

(i) An average carbon-related exhaust emissions calculation will be made for passenger automobiles.

(ii) An average carbon-related exhaust emissions calculation will be made for light trucks.

(b) For the purpose of calculating average fuel economy under paragraph (c) of this section and for the purpose of calculating average carbon-related exhaust emissions under paragraph (j) of this section:

(1) All fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emissions data submitted in accordance with § 600.006(e) or § 600.512(c) shall be used.

(2) The combined city/highway fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values will be calculated for each model type in accordance with § 600.208 except that:

(i) Separate fuel economy values will be calculated for model types and base levels associated with car lines for each category of passenger automobiles and light trucks as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) Total model year production data, as required by this subpart, will be used instead of sales projections;

(iii) [Reserved]

(iv) The fuel economy value will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg;

(v) The carbon-related exhaust emission value will be rounded to the nearest gram per mile; and

(vi) At the manufacturer's option, those vehicle configurations that are self-compensating to altitude changes may be separated by sales into high-altitude sales categories and low-altitude sales categories. These separate sales categories may then be treated (only for the purpose of this section) as separate configurations in accordance with the procedure of § 600.208-12(a)(4)(ii).

(3) The fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values for each vehicle configuration are the combined fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emissions calculated according to § 600.206-12(a)(3) except that:

(i) Separate fuel economy values will be calculated for vehicle configurations associated with car lines for each category of passenger automobiles and light trucks as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) Total model year production data, as required by this subpart will be used instead of sales projections; and

(iii) [Reserved]

(4) Emergency vehicles may be excluded from the fleet average carbon-related exhaust emission calculations described in paragraph (j) of this section. The manufacturer should notify the Administrator that they are making such an election in the model year reports required under § 600.512 of this chapter. Such vehicles should be excluded from both the calculation of the fleet average standard for a manufacturer under 40 CFR 86.1818-12(c)(4) and from the calculation of the fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions in paragraph (j) of this section.

(c)(1) Average fuel economy shall be calculated as follows:

(i) Except as allowed in paragraph (d) of this section, the average fuel economy for the model years before 2017 will be calculated individually for each category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

(ii) Except as permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, the average fuel economy for the 2017 and later model years will be calculated individually for each category identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the following equation:

(2) Divide the total production volume of that category of automobiles by a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a model type within that category of automobiles and is a fraction determined by dividing the number of automobiles of that model type produced by the manufacturer in the model year by:

(i) For gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled model types, the fuel economy calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

(ii) For alcohol-fueled model types, the fuel economy value calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section divided by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg; or

(iii) For natural gas-fueled model types, the fuel economy value calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section divided by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg; or

(iv) For alcohol dual fuel model types, for model years 1993 through 2019, the harmonic average of the following two terms; the result rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg:

(A) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on gasoline or diesel fuel as determined in § 600.208-12(b)(5)(i); and

(B) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on alcohol fuel as determined in § 600.208-12(b)(5)(ii) divided by 0.15 provided the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section are met; or

(v) For alcohol dual fuel model types, for model years after 2019, the combined model type fuel economy determined according to the following equation and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg:

(vi) For natural gas dual fuel model types, for model years 1993 through 2016, and optionally for 2021 and later model years, the harmonic average of the following two terms; the result rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg:

(A) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on gasoline or diesel as determined in § 600.208-12(b)(5)(i); and

(B) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on natural gas as determined in § 600.208-12(b)(5)(ii) divided by 0.15 provided the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section are met; or

(vii) This paragraph (c)(2)(vii) applies to model year 2017 through 2020 natural gas dual fuel model types. Model year 2021 and later natural gas dual fuel model types may use the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section or this paragraph (c)(2)(vii).

(A) For natural gas dual fuel model types, for model years after 2016, the combined model type fuel economy determined according to the following formula and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg:

(B) Model year 2017 through 2020 natural gas dual fuel model types must meet the following criteria to qualify for use of a Utility Factor greater than 0.5:
