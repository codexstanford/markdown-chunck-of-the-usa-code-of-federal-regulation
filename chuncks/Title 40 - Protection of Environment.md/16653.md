The plan shall provide for these required monitors to be operational by January 1, 2015.

(6) A plan for establishing SOmonitoring sites in accordance with the requirements of appendix D to this part shall be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator by July 1, 2011 as part of the annual network plan required in paragraph (a) (1). The plan shall provide for all required SOmonitoring sites to be operational by January 1, 2013.

(7) A plan for establishing CO monitoring sites in accordance with the requirements of appendix D to this part shall be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator. Plans for required CO monitors shall be submitted at least six months prior to the date such monitors must be established as required by section 58.13.

(8)(i) A plan for establishing near-road PMmonitoring sites in CBSAs having 2.5 million or more persons, in accordance with the requirements of appendix D to this part, shall be submitted as part of the annual monitoring network plan to the EPA Regional Administrator by July 1, 2014. The plan shall provide for these required monitoring stations to be operational by January 1, 2015.

(ii) A plan for establishing near-road PMmonitoring sites in CBSAs having 1 million or more persons, but less than 2.5 million persons, in accordance with the requirements of appendix D to this part, shall be submitted as part of the annual monitoring network plan to the EPA Regional Administrator by July 1, 2016. The plan shall provide for these required monitoring stations to be operational by January 1, 2017.

(9) The annual monitoring network plan shall provide for the required Osites to be operating on the first day of the applicable required Omonitoring season in effect on January 1, 2017 as listed in Table D-3 of appendix D of this part.

(10) A plan for making Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) measurements, if applicable, in accordance with the requirements of appendix D paragraph 5(a) of this part shall be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator no later than July 1, 2018.

(12) The identification of required NOmonitors as near-road, area-wide, or vulnerable and susceptible population monitors in accordance with Appendix D, section 4.3 of this part.

(13) The identification of any PMFEMs and/or ARMs used in the monitoring agency's network where the data are not of sufficient quality such that data are not to be compared to the NAAQS. For required SLAMS where the agency identifies that the PMClass III FEM or ARM does not produce data of sufficient quality for comparison to the NAAQS, the monitoring agency must ensure that an operating FRM or filter-based FEM meeting the sample frequency requirements described in ยง 58.12 or other Class III PMFEM or ARM with data of sufficient quality is operating and reporting data to meet the network design criteria described in appendix D to this part.

(c) The annual monitoring network plan must document how state and local agencies provide for the review of changes to a PMmonitoring network that impact the location of a violating PMmonitor. The affected state or local agency must document the process for obtaining public comment and include any comments received through the public notification process within their submitted plan.

(d) The state, or where applicable local, agency shall perform and submit to the EPA Regional Administrator an assessment of the air quality surveillance system every 5 years to determine, at a minimum, if the network meets the monitoring objectives defined in appendix D to this part, whether new sites are needed, whether existing sites are no longer needed and can be terminated, and whether new technologies are appropriate for incorporation into the ambient air monitoring network. The network assessment must consider the ability of existing and proposed sites to support air quality characterization for areas with relatively high populations of susceptible individuals (e.g., children with asthma), and, for any sites that are being proposed for discontinuance, the effect on data users other than the agency itself, such as nearby states and tribes or health effects studies. The state, or where applicable local, agency must submit a copy of this 5-year assessment, along with a revised annual network plan, to the Regional Administrator. The assessments are due every five years beginning July 1, 2010.

(e) All proposed additions and discontinuations of SLAMS monitors in annual monitoring network plans and periodic network assessments are subject to approval according to ยง 58.14.
