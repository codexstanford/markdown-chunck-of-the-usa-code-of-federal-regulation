###### ยง 430.03 Best management practices (BMPs) for spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine management, spill prevention, and control.
####### Amendment of BMP Plan.

(e)(1) Each mill subject to this section must amend its BMP Plan whenever there is a change in mill design, construction, operation, or maintenance that materially affects the potential for leaks or spills of spent pulping liquor, turpentine, or soap from the immediate process areas.

(2) Each mill subject to this section must complete a review and evaluation of the BMP Plan five years after the first BMP Plan is prepared and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, once every five years thereafter. As a result of this review and evaluation, the mill must amend the BMP Plan within three months of the review if the mill determines that any new or modified management practices and engineered controls are necessary to reduce significantly the likelihood of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine leaks, spills, or intentional diversions from the immediate process areas, including a schedule for implementation of such practices and controls.
