####### ยง 1090.1310 Testing to demonstrate compliance with standards.
######## i.e.,

(e) For gasoline produced at a fuel blending facility or a transmix processing facility, a gasoline manufacturer must measure such gasoline for oxygenate and for distillation parameters (T10, T50, T90, final boiling point, and percent residue). However, a fuel manufacturer or transmix processor does not need to measure the oxygenate content of gasoline if PCG, transmix, TGP, and blendstocks used to produce the batch did not contain any oxygenates, based on the following documentation:

(1) For PCG, documentation consists of oxygenate content identified on PTDs.

(2) For transmix, TGP, and blendstocks, documentation consists of affidavits or oxygenate test results from the person providing the transmix or blendstock stating that these products do not contain oxygenate.
