####### Opening of equipment.

(6)Vinyl chloride emissions from opening of equipment (excluding crude, intermediate, and final EDC storage tanks, but including prepolymerization reactors used in the manufacture of bulk resins and loading or unloading lines that are not opened to the atmosphere after each loading or unloading operation) are to be minimized follows:

(i) Before opening any equipment for any reason, the quantity of vinyl chloride which is contained therein is to be reduced to an amount which occupies a volume of no more than 2.0 percent of the equipment's containment volume or 0.0950 cubic meters (25 gallons), whichever is larger, at standard temperature and pressure.

(ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the equipment in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in ยง 61.66.
