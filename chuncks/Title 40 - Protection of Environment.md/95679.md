###### ยง 796.3500 Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25 &#xB0;C.
####### Adjustment of buffer concentrations.,1

(C)() The concentrations of all the above buffer solutions are the maximum concentration to be employed in carrying out hydrolysis measurements. If the initial concentration of the test chemical is less than 10M, the buffer concentration shall be lowered by a corresponding amount; e.g., if the initial test chemical concentration is 10M, the concentration of the above buffers shall be reduced by a factor of 10. In addition, for those reactions in which an acid or base is not a reaction product, the minimum buffer concentration necessary for maintaining the pH within + 0.05 units shall be employed.
