###### 8.4.1 Continuous Sampling.

You must follow the procedures of section 8.4 of Method 7E.

8.4.2 Integrated Sampling. Evacuate the flexible bag or sample tank. Set up the equipment as shown in Figure 10-1 with the bag disconnected. Place the probe in the stack and purge the sampling line. Connect the bag, making sure that all connections are leak-free. Sample at a rate proportional to the stack velocity. If needed, the COcontent of the gas may be determined by using the Method 3 integrated sample procedures, or by weighing an ascarite COremoval tube used and computing COconcentration from the gas volume sampled and the weight gain of the tube. Data may be recorded on a form similar to Table 10-1. If a sample tank is used for sample collection, follow procedures similar to those in sections 8.1.2, 8.2.3, 8.3, and 12.4 of Method 25 as appropriate to prepare the tank, conduct the sampling, and correct the measured sample concentration.
