###### ยง 796.3500 Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25 &#xB0;C.
####### Test data report.

(3)(i) For Procedures 1 and 2, report k, the hydrolysis half-life (t), and the coefficient of determination (R) for each pH employed in the rate measurements. In addition, report the individual values, the mean value, and the standard deviation for each set of replicate concentration measurements. Finally, report k, k, and k.

(ii) For Procedure 3, report kand the half-life for each pH employed in the rate measurements. In addition, report the individual values, the mean value, and the standard deviation for each set of replicate concentration measurements. Finally, report k, k, and k.

(iii) If, after 672 hours, the concentration (C) is the same as the initial concentration (C) within experimental error, then kcannot be calculated and the chemical can be reported as being persistent with respect to hydrolysis.
