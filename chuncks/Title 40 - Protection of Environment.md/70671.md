###### Actual contamination.,i.e.

6.3.4.1Determine those sensitive environments subject to actual contamination (, those located partially or wholly within a distance category subject to actual contamination). Assign value(s) from table 4-23 (section 4.1.4.3.1.1) to each sensitive environment subject to actual contamination.

For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 6-18. In assigning a value from table 6-18, include only those portions of wetlands located within distance categories subject to actual contamination. If a wetland is located partially in a distance category subject to actual contamination and partially in one subject to potential contamination, then solely for purposes of table 6-18, count the portion in the distance category subject to potential contamination under the potential contamination factor in section 6.3.4.2. Determine the total acreage of wetlands within those distance categories subject to actual contamination and assign a value from table 6-18 based on this total acreage.

Calculate the actual contamination factor value (EA) as follows:

Enter the value assigned in table 6-1.
