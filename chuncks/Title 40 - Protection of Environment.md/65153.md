####### § 257.90 Applicability.
######## Annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report.

(e)For existing CCR landfills and existing CCR surface impoundments, no later than January 31, 2018, and annually thereafter, the owner or operator must prepare an annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. For new CCR landfills, new CCR surface impoundments, and all lateral expansions of CCR units, the owner or operator must prepare the initial annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report no later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year a groundwater monitoring system has been established for such CCR unit as required by this subpart, and annually thereafter. For the preceding calendar year, the annual report must document the status of the groundwater monitoring and corrective action program for the CCR unit, summarize key actions completed, describe any problems encountered, discuss actions to resolve the problems, and project key activities for the upcoming year. For purposes of this section, the owner or operator has prepared the annual report when the report is placed in the facility's operating record as required by § 257.105(h)(1). At a minimum, the annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report must contain the following information, to the extent available:

(1) A map, aerial image, or diagram showing the CCR unit and all background (or upgradient) and downgradient monitoring wells, to include the well identification numbers, that are part of the groundwater monitoring program for the CCR unit;

(2) Identification of any monitoring wells that were installed or decommissioned during the preceding year, along with a narrative description of why those actions were taken;

(3) In addition to all the monitoring data obtained under §§ 257.90 through 257.98, a summary including the number of groundwater samples that were collected for analysis for each background and downgradient well, the dates the samples were collected, and whether the sample was required by the detection monitoring or assessment monitoring programs;

(4) A narrative discussion of any transition between monitoring programs (e.g., the date and circumstances for transitioning from detection monitoring to assessment monitoring in addition to identifying the constituent(s) detected at a statistically significant increase over background levels); and

(5) Other information required to be included in the annual report as specified in §§ 257.90 through 257.98.

(6) A section at the beginning of the annual report that provides an overview of the current status of groundwater monitoring and corrective action programs for the CCR unit. At a minimum, the summary must specify all of the following:

(i) At the start of the current annual reporting period, whether the CCR unit was operating under the detection monitoring program in § 257.94 or the assessment monitoring program in § 257.95;

(ii) At the end of the current annual reporting period, whether the CCR unit was operating under the detection monitoring program in § 257.94 or the assessment monitoring program in § 257.95;

(iii) If it was determined that there was a statistically significant increase over background for one or more constituents listed in appendix III to this part pursuant to § 257.94(e):

(A) Identify those constituents listed in appendix III to this part and the names of the monitoring wells associated with such an increase; and

(B) Provide the date when the assessment monitoring program was initiated for the CCR unit.

(iv) If it was determined that there was a statistically significant level above the groundwater protection standard for one or more constituents listed in appendix IV to this part pursuant to § 257.95(g) include all of the following:

(A) Identify those constituents listed in appendix IV to this part and the names of the monitoring wells associated with such an increase;

(B) Provide the date when the assessment of corrective measures was initiated for the CCR unit;

(C) Provide the date when the public meeting was held for the assessment of corrective measures for the CCR unit; and

(D) Provide the date when the assessment of corrective measures was completed for the CCR unit.

(v) Whether a remedy was selected pursuant to § 257.97 during the current annual reporting period, and if so, the date of remedy selection; and

(vi) Whether remedial activities were initiated or are ongoing pursuant to § 257.98 during the current annual reporting period.

(f) The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 257.105(h), the notification requirements specified in § 257.106(h), and the internet requirements specified in § 257.107(h).
