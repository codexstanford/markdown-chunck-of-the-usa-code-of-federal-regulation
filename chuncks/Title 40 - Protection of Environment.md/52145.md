####### Analytical methods.

(2)Use a quality-assured analytical measurement technology capable of detecting the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest and use a sampling and analytical procedure validated with the analyte of interest at the concentration of interest. Where calibration standards for the analyte are not available, a chemically similar surrogate may be used. Acceptable analytical measurement technologies include but are not limited to gas chromatography (GC) with an appropriate detector, infrared (IR), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Acceptable methods for determining fluorinated GHGs include EPA Method 18 in appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60, EPA Method 320 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 63, EPA 430-R-10-003 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7), ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7), or other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 301 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A or some other scientifically sound validation protocol. Acceptable methods for determining total fluorine concentrations for fluorine-containing compounds in streams under paragraph (b)(3) of this section include ASTM D7359-08 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7), or other analytical methods validated using EPA Method 301 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A or some other scientifically sound validation protocol. The validation protocol may include analytical technology manufacturer specifications or recommendations.
