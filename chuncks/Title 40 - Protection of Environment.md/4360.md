###### Air volume measurement.

6.2If the flow rate changes substantially or nonuniformly during the sampling period, appreciable error in the estimated air volume may result from using the average of the presampling and postsampling flow rates. Greater air volume measurement accuracy may be achieved by (1) equipping the sampler with a flow controlling mechanism that maintains constant air flow during the sampling period,* (2) using a calibrated, continuous flow rate recording device to record the actual flow rate during the samping period and integrating the flow rate over the period, or (3) any other means that will accurately measure the total air volume sampled during the sampling period. Use of a continuous flow recorder is recommended, particularly if the sampler is not equipped with a constant flow controller.
