####### § 63.1218 What are the standards for hydrochloric acid production furnaces that burn hazardous waste?
######## Emission limits for existing sources.

(a)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

(1) For dioxins and furans, either carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this section;

(2) For mercury, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

(3) For lead and cadmium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

(5) For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, either:

(i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by § 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

(ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane;

(6) For hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas, either:

(i) Emission in excess of 150 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as a chloride (Clequivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or

(ii) Emissions greater than the levels that would be emitted if the source is achieving a system removal efficiency (SRE) of less than 99.923 percent for total chlorine and chloride fed to the combustor. You must calculate SRE from the following equation:

(7) For particulate matter, except for an area source as defined under § 63.2, hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas emissions in excess of the levels provided by paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
