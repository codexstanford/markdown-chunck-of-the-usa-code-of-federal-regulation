######## High efficiency alternator.

(ix)The credit for a high efficiency alternator for passenger automobiles and light trucks shall be calculated using the following equation, and rounded to the nearest 0.1 grams/mile:

(2) The maximum allowable decrease in the manufacturer's combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet average COemissions attributable to use of the default credit values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is 15 g/mi for model years 2023 through 2026 and 10 g/mi in all other model years. If the total of the COg/mi credit values from paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not exceed 10 or 15 g/mi (as applicable) for any passenger automobile or light truck in a manufacturer's fleet, then the total off-cycle credits may be calculated according to paragraph (f) of this section. If the total of the COg/mi credit values from paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds 10 or 15 g/mi (as applicable) for any passenger automobile or light truck in a manufacturer's fleet, then the gram per mile decrease for the combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet must be determined according to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to determine whether the applicable limitation has been exceeded.

(i) Determine the gram per mile decrease for the combined passenger automobile and light truck fleet using the following formula:

(ii) If the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is greater than 10 or 15 grams per mile (as applicable), the total credits, in Megagrams, that may be accrued by a manufacturer using the default gram per mile values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be determined using the following formula:

(iii) If the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not greater than 10 or 15 grams per mile (as applicable), then the credits that may be accrued by a manufacturer using the default gram per mile values in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not exceed the allowable limit, and total credits may be determined for each category of vehicles according to paragraph (f) of this section.

(iv) If the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is greater than 10 or 15 grams per mile (as applicable), then the combined passenger automobile and light truck credits, in Megagrams, that may be accrued using the calculations in paragraph (f) of this section must not exceed the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This limitation should generally be done by reducing the amount of credits attributable to the vehicle category that caused the limit to be exceeded such that the total value does not exceed the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(3) In lieu of using the default gram per mile values specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for specific technologies, a manufacturer may determine an alternative value for any of the specified technologies. An alternative value must be determined using one of the methods specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

(4) Definitions for the purposes of this paragraph (b) are as follows:
