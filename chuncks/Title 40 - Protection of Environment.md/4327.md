###### Determination of flow rate at sampling site:

9.4.2For short-term samples, the standard flow rate is determined at the sampling site at the initiation and completion of sample collection with a calibrated flow measuring device connected to the inlet of the absorber. For 24-hour samples, the standard flow rate is determined at the time the absorber is placed in the sampling train and again when the absorber is removed from the train for shipment to the analytical laboratory with a calibrated flow measuring device connected to the inlet of the sampling train. The flow rate determination must be made with all components of the sampling system in operation (e.g., the absorber temperature controller and any sample box heaters must also be operating). Equation 6 may be used to determine the standard flow rate when a calibrated positive displacement meter is used as the flow measuring device. Other types of calibrated flow measuring devices may also be used to determine the flow rate at the sampling site provided that the user applies any appropriate corrections to devices for which output is dependent on temperature or pressure.

If a barometer is not available, the following equation may be used to determine the barometric pressure:

If the initial flow rate (Q) differs from the flow rate of the critical orifice or the flow rate indicated by the flowmeter in the sampling train (Q) by more than 5 percent as determined by equation (8), check for leaks and redetermine Q.

Invalidate the sample if the difference between the initial (Q) and final (Q) flow rates is more than 5 percent as determined by equation (9):
