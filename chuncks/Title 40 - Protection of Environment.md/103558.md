######## Copper-based zeolite SCR.

(1)Total ammonia storage capacity is a key aging metric for copper-zeolite SCR catalysts, and they typically contain multiple types of storage sites. It is typical to model these catalysts using two different storage sites, one of which is more active for NOreduction, as this has been shown to be an effective metric for tracking thermal aging. In this case, the recommended aging metric is the ratio between the storage capacity of the two sites, with more active site being in the denominator.
