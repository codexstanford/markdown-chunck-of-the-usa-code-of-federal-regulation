(d)EPA has determined that the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. This determination bears on the area's obligations with respect to implementation of two specific 1-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding requirements: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee programs.

(e) Approval-The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a revision to the Texas SIP on February 18, 2003, concerning the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance plan. This SIP revision was adopted by TCEQ on February 5, 2003. This SIP revision satisfies the Clean Air Act requirement, as amended in 1990, for the second 10-year update to the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance area.
