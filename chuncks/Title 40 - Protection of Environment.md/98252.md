(6)(i) At the time of termination or death during the study, all parental animals (P and F1) and when litter size permits at least three pups per sex per litter from the unselected F1 weanlings and the F2 weanlings shall be examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes. Special attention shall be paid to the organs of the reproductive system.

(ii) Dead pups or pups that are terminated in a moribund condition should be examined for possible defects and/or cause of death.

(iii) At the time of necropsy, a vaginal smear should be examined to determine the stage of the estrous cycle. The uteri of all cohabited females should be examined, in a manner which does not compromise histopathological evaluation, for the presence and number of implantation sites.
