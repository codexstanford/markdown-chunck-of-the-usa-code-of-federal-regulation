####### Special provisions for spark-ignition engines.

(j)The following provisions apply for spark-ignition engines that control air-fuel ratios at or near stoichiometry starting with model year 2027:

(1) Catalyst bed temperature during extended idle may not fall below 350 &#xB0;C, or a lower temperature that we approve. Describe how you designed your engine to meet this requirement in your application for certification. You may ask us to approve alternative strategies to prevent emissions from increasing during idle.

(2) In addition to the information requirements of ยง 1036.205(b), describe why you rely on any AECDs instead of other engine designs for thermal protection of catalyst or other emission-related components. Also describe the accuracy of any modeled or measured temperatures used to activate the AECD. We may ask you to submit a second-by-second comparison of any modeled and measured component temperatures as part of your application for certification.
