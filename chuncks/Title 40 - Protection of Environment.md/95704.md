() Add 0.5 ml of a 0.1 percent solution (weight/volume) of Evans blue stain to a 1 milliliter aliquot of algae from a control container and to a 1 milliliter aliquot of algae from the test container having the lowest concentration of test chemical which completely inhibited algal growth (if algal growth was not completely inhibited, select an aliquot of algae for staining from the test container having the highest concentration of test chemical which inhibited algal growth). Wait 10 to 30 minutes, examine microscopically, and determine the percent of the cells which stain blue (indicating cell mortality). A staining control shall be performed concurrently using heat-killed or formaldehyde-preserved algal cells; 100 percent of these cells shall stain blue.
