(2) Tolerances are established for residues of inpyrfluxam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 2 to this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 to this section is to be determined by measuring the free and conjugated forms of the sum of inpyrfluxam (3-(difluoromethyl)--[(3)-2,3-dihydro-1,1,3-trimethyl-1-inden-4-yl]-1-methyl-1-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, and its metabolites 3-(difluoromethyl)--[1&#x2032;-(hydroxymethyl)-(1&#x2032;3&#x2032;)-1&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dimethyl-2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dihydro-1&#x2032;-inden-4&#x2032;-yl]-1-methyl-1-pyrazole-4-carboxamide and 3-(difluoromethyl)--[1&#x2032;-(hydroxymethyl)-(1&#x2032;3&#x2032;)-1&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dimethyl-2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dihydro-1&#x2032;-inden-4&#x2032;-yl]-1-methyl-1-pyrazole-4-carboxamid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of inpyrfluxam, in or on the commodity:
