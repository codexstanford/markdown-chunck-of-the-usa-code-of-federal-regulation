####### ยง 60.5805a What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Useful thermal output,e.g.,,e.g.,

means the thermal energy made available for use in any heating application (steam delivered to an industrial process for a heating application, including thermal cooling applications) that is not used for electric generation, mechanical output at the designated facility, to directly enhance the performance of the designated facility (economizer output is not useful thermal output, but thermal energy used to reduce fuel moisture is considered useful thermal output), or to supply energy to a pollution control device at the designated facility. Useful thermal output for designated facility(s) with no condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the designated facility(s)) or where measuring the energy in the condensate (or other thermal energy input to the designated facility(s)) would not meaningfully impact the emission rate calculation is measured against the energy in the thermal output at SATP conditions. Designated facility(s) with meaningful energy in the condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the designated facility) must measure the energy in the condensate and subtract that energy relative to SATP conditions from the measured thermal output.
