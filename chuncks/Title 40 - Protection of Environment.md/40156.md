8.11

8.11.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected (assumed) gas matrix.

8.11.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture is much greater than anticipated, it may be necessary to use a shorter path length or dilute the sample.

8.11.3 Compare the pre- and post-test CTS spectra. The peak absorbance in pre- and post-test CTS must be +/-5 percent of the mean value. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.

Use analyte spiking (sections 8.6.2, 9.2 and 13.0 of this method) to verify that the sampling system can transport the analytes from the probe to the FTIR system.
