####### Post-reduction year

means the one year period beginning with the date early reductions have to be achieved to qualify for a compliance extension under subpart D of this part, unless a source has established with the permitting authority an earlier one year period as the post-reduction year. For most sources, the post-reduction year would begin with the date of proposal of the first section 112(d) standard applicable to the early reductions source; however, for sources that have made enforceable commitments, it would be the year from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994.
