####### Production weighted particulate average

means the manufacturer's production-weighted average particulate emission level, for certification purposes, of all of its diesel engine families included in the light-duty particulate averaging program. It is calculated at the end of the model year by multiplying each family particulate emission limit by its respective production, summing those terms, and dividing the sum by the total production of the effected families. Those vehicles produced for sale in California or at high altitude shall each be averaged separately from those produced for sale in any other area.
