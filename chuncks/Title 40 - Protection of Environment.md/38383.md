####### Stack Gas Volumetric Flow Rate Records.

7.1.5

7.1.5.1 Hourly measurements of stack gas volumetric flow rate during unit operation are required for routine operation of sorbent trap monitoring systems, to maintain the required ratio of stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate (see section 8.2.2 of Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter). Hourly stack gas flow rate data are also needed in order to demonstrate compliance with electrical output-based Hg emissions limits, as provided in section 6.2.2 of this appendix.

7.1.5.2 For each affected unit or common stack, if hourly measurements of stack gas flow rate are needed for sorbent trap monitoring system operation or to convert Hg concentrations to the units of the emission standard, use a flow rate monitor that meets the requirements of part 75 of this chapter to record the required data. You must keep hourly flow rate records, as specified in ยง 75.57(c)(2) of this chapter.
