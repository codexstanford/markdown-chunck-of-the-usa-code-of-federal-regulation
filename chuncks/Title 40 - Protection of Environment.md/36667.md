####### ยง 63.7322 What test methods and other procedures must I use to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter?
######## i.e.

(2) During each particulate matter test run, sample only during periods of actual pushing when the capture system fan and control device are engaged. Collect a minimum sample volume of 30 dry standard cubic feet of gas during each test run. Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test. Each run must start at the beginning of a push and finish at the end of a push (, sample for an integral number of pushes).

(3) Determine the total combined weight in tons of coke pushed during the duration of each test run according to the procedures in your source test plan for calculating coke yield from the quantity of coal charged to an individual oven.

(4) Compute the process-weighted mass emissions (E) for each test run using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
