(a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and disapproval of State plans and the Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion thereof is based upon a determination by the Administrator that such plan or portion meets the requirements of section 110 of the Act and the provisions of part 51 of this chapter.

(b) Any plan or portion thereof promulgated by the Administrator substitutes for a State plan or portion thereof disapproved by the Administrator or not submitted by a State, or supplements a State plan or portion thereof. The promulgated provisions, together with any portions of a State plan approved by the Administrator, constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the Act.

(c) Where nonregulatory provisions of a plan are disapproved, the disapproval is noted in this part and a detailed evaluation is provided to the State, but no substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
