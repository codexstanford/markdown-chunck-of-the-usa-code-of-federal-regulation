###### ยง 63.1426 Process vent requirements for determining organic HAP concentration, control efficiency, and aggregated organic HAP emission reduction for a PMPU.
####### Design evaluation.,3,i

(f)A design evaluation is required for those control techniques that receive less than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from one or more PMPU, if the owner or operator has chosen not to conduct a performance test for those control techniques in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The design evaluation shall include documentation demonstrating that the control technique being used achieves the required control efficiency under worst-case conditions, as determined from the emission profile described in ยง 63.1426(c)(3)(i)(B)()().

(1) Except for ECO whose design evaluation is presented in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to demonstrate that a control technique meets the required control efficiency, a design evaluation shall address the composition and organic HAP concentration of the vent stream, immediately preceding the use of the control technique. A design evaluation shall also address other vent stream characteristics and control technique operating parameters, as specified in any one of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, depending on the type of control technique that is used. If the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control technique, the owner or operator shall also account for all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received into the control technique from one or more PMPUs, for purposes of the efficiency determination.

(i) For an enclosed combustion technique used to comply with the provisions of ยง 63.1425(b)(1), (c)(1), or (d), with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 &#xB0;C, the design evaluation shall document that these conditions exist.

(ii) For a combustion control technique that does not satisfy the criteria in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation shall document the control efficiency and address the characteristics listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, depending on the type of control technique.

(A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, shall consider the vent stream flow rate, and shall establish the design minimum and average temperatures in the combustion zone and the combustion zone residence time.

(B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream flow rate and shall establish the design minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.

(C) For a boiler or process heater, in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream flow rate; shall establish the design minimum and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time; and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone.

(iii) For a condenser, in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design average temperature of the exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser shall be measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.

(iv) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite as part of the control technique (such as a fixed-bed adsorber), in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon beds, design total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of the carbon. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall also be included.

(v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite as part of the control technique (such as a carbon canister), in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream mass or volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control technique and source operating schedule.

(vi) For a scrubber, in the design evaluation the owner or operator shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and shall include the additional information in paragraphs (f)(1)(vi) (A) and (B) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.

(A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays.

(B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column and for individual packed sections, if the column contains more than one packed section.

(2) For ECO, the design evaluation shall establish the minimum duration (time) of the ECO, the maximum pressure at the end of the ECO, or the maximum epoxide concentration in the reactor liquid at the end of the ECO for each product class.
