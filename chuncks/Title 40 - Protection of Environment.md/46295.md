####### VVT system.

(H)The manufacturer must perform a test at each target error limit and slow response limit calibrated to the malfunction criteria specified in paragraphs (h)(9)(ii)(A) and (h)(9)(ii)(B) of this section. In conducting the VVT system demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the VVT system to operate at the malfunction limit. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.

(I) For each of the testing requirements of this paragraph (l)(3)(ii), if the manufacturer has established that only a functional check is required because no failure or deterioration of the specific tested system could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds, the manufacturer is not required to perform a demonstration test; however the manufacturer is required to provide the data and/or engineering analyses used to determine that only a functional test of the system(s) is required.
