####### Communications to a scan tool.

(3)For model years 2013 and later, all OBD control modules (e.g., engine, auxiliary emission control module) on a single vehicle must use the same protocol for communication of required emission-related messages from on-board to off-board network communications to a scan tool meeting SAE J1978 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) specifications or designed to communicate with an SAE J1939 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) network. Engine manufacturers shall not alter normal operation of the engine emission control system due to the presence of off-board test equipment accessing information required by this paragraph (k). The OBD system must use one of the following standardized protocols:

(i) ISO 15765-4:2005(E) (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section). All required emission-related messages using this protocol must use a 500 kbps baud rate.

(ii) SAE J1939 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section). This protocol may only be used on vehicles with diesel engines.
