####### Uninstalled APU tested separately.

(2)If you separately measure emission rates (g/hr) over an appropriate duty-cycle for each pollutant from the APU when it is not installed in the locomotive, you may use the measured emissions rates (g/hr) as the locomotive's idle emissions rates when the locomotive is shutdown and the APU is operating. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(2), an appropriate duty-cycle is one that approximates the APU engine's cycle-weighted power when operating in the locomotive. Apply appropriate deterioration factors to the measured emission rates. You may ask to carryover APU emission data for a previous test, or use data for the same APU installed on locomotives in another engine family.
