####### Ambient temperature for preconditioning.

(2)Instantaneous ambient temperature values may be above -4.0 &#xB0;C or below -9.0 &#xB0;C but not for more than 3 minutes at a time during the preconditioning period. At no time may the ambient temperatures be below -12.0 &#xB0;C or above -1.0 &#xB0;C. The average ambient temperature during preconditioning must be (-7.0 +/-2.8) &#xB0;C. You may precondition vehicles at temperatures above -7.0 &#xB0;C or with a temperature tolerance greater than that described in this section (or both) if you determine that this will not cause NMHC, CO, or COemissions to decrease; if you modify the temperature specifications for vehicle preconditioning, adjust the procedures described in this section appropriately for your testing.
