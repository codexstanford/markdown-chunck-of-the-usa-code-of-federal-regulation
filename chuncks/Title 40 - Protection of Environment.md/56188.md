###### ยง 141.132 Monitoring requirements.
####### Monitoring requirements for disinfection byproduct precursors (DBPP),Routine monitoring.

(d)-(1)Subpart H systems which use conventional filtration treatment (as defined in ยง 141.2) must monitor each treatment plant for TOC no later than the point of combined filter effluent turbidity monitoring and representative of the treated water. All systems required to monitor under this paragraph (d)(1) must also monitor for TOC in the source water prior to any treatment at the same time as monitoring for TOC in the treated water. These samples (source water and treated water) are referred to as paired samples. At the same time as the source water sample is taken, all systems must monitor for alkalinity in the source water prior to any treatment. Systems must take one paired sample and one source water alkalinity sample per month per plant at a time representative of normal operating conditions and influent water quality.
