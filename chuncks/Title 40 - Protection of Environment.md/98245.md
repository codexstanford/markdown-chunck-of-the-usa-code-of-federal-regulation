####### Standardization of litter sizes.

(v)(A) Animals should be allowed to litter normally and rear their offspring to weaning. Standardization of litter sizes is optional.

(B) If standardization is performed, the following procedure should be used. On day 4 after birth, the size of each litter may be adjusted by eliminating extra pups by random selection to yield, as nearly as possible, four males and four females per litter or five males and five females per litter. Selective elimination of pups, i.e. based upon body weight, is not appropriate. Whenever the number of male or female pups prevents having four (or five) of each sex per litter, partial adjustment (for example, five males and three females, or four males and six females) is acceptable. Adjustments are not appropriate for litters of eight pups or less.
