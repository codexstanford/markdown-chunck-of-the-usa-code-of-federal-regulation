####### Recordkeeping.

(d)(1) As required by ยง 63.10(b) of this part, the owner or operator shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by the general provisions and this subpart:

(i) The owner or operator must retain each record for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. The most recent 2 years of records must be retained at the facility. The remaining 3 years of records may be retained off site;

(ii) The owner or operator may retain records on microfilm, on a computer, on computer disks, on magnetic tape, or on microfiche; and

(iii) The owner or operator may report required information on paper or on a labeled computer disk using commonly available and EPA-compatible computer software.

(2) In addition to the general records required by ยง 63.10(b)(2) of this part, the owner or operator shall maintain records of the following information:

(i) Any bag leak detection system alarms, including the date and time of the alarm, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the alarm, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the alarm was corrected;

(ii) ESP parameter value(s) used to monitor ESP performance, including any period when the value(s) deviated from the established limit(s), the date and time of the deviation, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the deviation, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the deviation was corrected;

(iii) Air temperature above the molten glass in an uncontrolled cold top electric furnace, including any period when the temperature exceeded 120 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F) at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface, the date and time of the exceedance, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the exceedance, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the exceedance was corrected;

(iv) Uncontrolled glass-melting furnace (that is not a cold top electric furnace) parameter value(s) used to monitor furnace performance, including any period when the value(s) exceeded the established limit(s), the date and time of the exceedance, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the exceedance, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the exceedance was corrected;

(v) The formulation of each binder batch and the LOI and density for each product manufactured on a rotary spin manufacturing line or flame attenuation manufacturing line subject to the provisions of this subpart, and the free-formaldehyde and free-phenol contents of each resin shipment received and of each resin used in the binder formulation;

(vi) Process parameter level(s) for RS and FA manufacturing lines that use process modifications to comply with the emission limits, including any period when the parameter level(s) deviated from the established limit(s), the date and time of the deviation, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the deviation, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the deviation was corrected;

(vii) Scrubber pressure drop, scrubbing liquid flow rate, and any chemical additive (including chemical feed rate to the scrubber), including any period when a parameter level(s) deviated from the established limit(s), the date and time of the deviation, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the deviation, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the deviation was corrected;

(viii) Incinerator operating temperature and results of periodic inspection of incinerator components, including any period when the temperature fell below the established average or the inspection identified problems with the incinerator, the date and time of the problem, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the problem, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the problem was corrected;

(ix) Glass pull rate, including any period when the pull rate exceeded the average pull rate established during the performance test by more than 20 percent, the date and time of the exceedance, when corrective actions were initiated, the cause of the exceedance, an explanation of the corrective actions taken, and when the cause of the exceedance was corrected.

(x) Records of your cullet sampling or records of inspections from cullet providers.

(xi) For each gas-fired glass-melting furnace that uses cullet, records of the daily average cullet percentage, and the 30-day rolling average percent cullet in the materials mix charged to the furnace. The initial daily average should be recorded on the compliance date and the first 30-day rolling average should be calculated 30 days after the compliance date.
