###### Standards and Compliance Requirements
####### § 63.11516 What are my standards and management practices?
######## Standards for dry abrasive blasting of objects greater than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in any one dimension.

(3)If you own or operate a new or existing dry abrasive blasting affected source which consists of a dry abrasive blasting operation which is performed on objects greater than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in any one dimension, you may implement management practices to minimize emissions of MFHAP as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section instead of the practices required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. You must demonstrate that management practices are being implemented by complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

(i) Management practices for dry abrasive blasting of objects greater than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in any one dimension are specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.

(A) You must take measures necessary to minimize excess dust in the surrounding area to reduce MFHAP emissions, as practicable; and

(B) You must enclose abrasive material storage areas and holding bins, seal chutes and conveyors that transport abrasive material; and

(C) You must operate all equipment associated with dry abrasive blasting operations according to manufacturer's instructions; and

(D) You must not re-use dry abrasive blasting media unless contaminants (i.e., any material other than the base metal, such as paint residue) have been removed by filtration or screening, and the abrasive material conforms to its original size; and

(E) Whenever practicable, you must switch from high particulate matter (PM)-emitting blast media (e.g., sand) to low PM-emitting blast media (e.g., crushed glass, specular hematite, steel shot, aluminum oxide), where PM is a surrogate for MFHAP.

(ii) You must perform visual determinations of fugitive emissions, as specified in § 63.11517(b), "What are my monitoring requirements?", according to paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.

(A) For abrasive blasting of objects greater than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in any one dimension that is performed outdoors, you must perform visual determinations of fugitive emissions at the fenceline or property border nearest to the outdoor dry abrasive blasting operation.

(B) For abrasive blasting of objects greater than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in any one dimension that is performed indoors, you must perform visual determinations of fugitive emissions at the primary vent, stack, exit, or opening from the building containing the abrasive blasting operations.

(iii) You must keep a record of all visual determinations of fugitive emissions along with any corrective action taken in accordance with the requirements in § 63.11519(c)(2), "What are my notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements?"

(iv) If visible fugitive emissions are detected, you must perform corrective actions until the visible fugitive emissions are eliminated, at which time you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) You must perform a follow-up inspection for visible fugitive emissions in accordance with § 63.11517(a), "Monitoring Requirements."

(B) You must report all instances where visible emissions are detected, along with any corrective action taken and the results of subsequent follow-up inspections for visible emissions, with your annual certification and compliance report as required by § 63.11519(b)(5), "Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements."
