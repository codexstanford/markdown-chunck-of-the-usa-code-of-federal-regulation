###### Microbiological analysis.

4.5To monitor the viability of the microbial cultures being studied, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter MPN determination. This is used as an indicator of the relative change in biomass. This test design relies on using growth response as an indication of enhanced activity as compared to a "no addition" control.
