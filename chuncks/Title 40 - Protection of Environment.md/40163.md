###### FTIR Cell Volume.

10.5Evacuate the cell to &#x2264;5 mmHg. Measure the initial absolute temperature (T) and absolute pressure (P). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume (V), meter absolute temperature (T), and meter absolute pressure (P); and the cell final absolute temperature (T) and absolute pressure (P). Calculate the FTIR cell volume VSS, including that of the connecting tubing, as follows:

Analyte concentrations shall be measured using reference spectra from the EPA FTIR spectral library. When EPA library spectra are not available, the procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol shall be followed to prepare reference spectra of all the target analytes.
