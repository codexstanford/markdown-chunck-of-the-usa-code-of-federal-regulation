###### ยง 124.16 Stays of contested permit conditions.
####### Stays based on cross effects.

(b)(1) A stay may be granted based on the grounds that an appeal to the Administrator under ยง 124.19 of one permit may result in changes to another EPA-issued permit only when each of the permits involved has been appealed to the Administrator.

(2) No stay of an EPA-issued RCRA, UIC, or NPDES permit shall be granted based on the staying of any State-issued permit except at the discretion of the Regional Administrator and only upon written request from the State Director.

(c) Any facility or activity holding an existing permit must:

(1) Comply with the conditions of that permit during any modification or revocation and reissuance proceeding under ยง 124.5; and

(2) To the extent conditions of any new permit are stayed under this section, comply with the conditions of the existing permit which correspond to the stayed conditions, unless compliance with the existing conditions would be technologically incompatible with compliance with other conditions of the new permit which have not been stayed.
