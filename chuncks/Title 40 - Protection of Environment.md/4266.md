2.1 A measured volume of air is bubbled through a solution of 0.04 M potassium tetrachloromercurate (TCM). The SOpresent in the air stream reacts with the TCM solution to form a stable monochlorosulfonatomercurate() complex. Once formed, this complex resists air oxidation() and is stable in the presence of strong oxidants such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen. During subsequent analysis, the complex is reacted with acid-bleached pararosaniline dye and formaldehyde to form an intensely colored pararosaniline methyl sulfonic acid.
