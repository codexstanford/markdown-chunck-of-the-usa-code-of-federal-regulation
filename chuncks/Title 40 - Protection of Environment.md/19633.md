() Determine FV by the following equation:

(D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.

(ii) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (2) or Equations (4) and (5), as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b) through (g).

(iii) Compliance is demonstrated if the installation of a total enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation (2) (or the value of Hdetermined from Equations (4) and (5), as applicable) is equal to or greater than the required efficiency as specified below:

(A) For coating operations subject to the standards of § 60.712(a), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(3), 0.95 (95 percent); or

(B) For coating operations subject to the standards of § 60.712(b)(2)(i), the value of E determined from Equation (2) (or the value of Hdetermined from Equations (4) and (5), as applicable) pursuant to § 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or reconstruction or 0.95 (95 percent), whichever is lower.

(6) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(c) (standard for new mix equipment with concurrent construction of a control device), each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate upon inspection that:

(i) Covers satisfying the requirements of § 60.712(c)(1)-(5) have been installed and are being used properly;

(ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in § 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating mix preparation equipment is used;

(iii) The coating mix preparation equipment is vented to a control device; and

(iv) The control device efficiency (E or H, as applicable) determined using Equation (2) or Equations (4) and (5), respectively, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b)-(g) is equal to or greater than 0.95.

(7) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(d)(1) (standard for mix equipment), each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate upon inspection that:

(i) Covers satisfying the requirements of § 60.712(c)(1)-(5) have been installed and are being used properly;

(ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in § 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating mix preparation equipment is used; and

(iii) The coating mix preparation equipment is vented to a control device.

(8) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(d)(2) (standard for mix equipment), each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate upon inspection that both:

(i) Covers satisfying the requirements of § 60.712(c)(1)-(5) have been installed and are being used properly; and

(ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in § 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating mix preparation equipment is used.

(9) To determine compliance with § 60.712(e) (high-solids coatings alternative standard), each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine the weighted average mass of VOC contained in the coating per volume of coating solids applied for each and every nominal 1-month period according to the following procedures:

(i) Determine the weight fraction of VOC in each coating applied using Method 24 as specified in § 60.715(a);

(ii) Determine the volume of coating solids in each coating applied from the facility records; and

(iii) Compute the weighted average by the following equation:

(iv) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or equal to 0.20 kilogram of VOC per liter of coating solids applied, the facility is in compliance.

(c) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when determining if the standards for coating operations specified in § 60.712(a) and (b) are being attained.

(d) If a control device other than a carbon adsorber, condenser, or incinerator is used to control emissions from an affected facility, the necessary operating specifications for that device must be obtained from the Administrator. An example of such a device is a flare.
