####### § 1065.365 Nonmethane cutter penetration fractions.
######## PF

(10) Divide the mean CHconcentration measured through the nonmethane cutter by the mean CHconcentration measured after bypassing the nonmethane cutter. The result is the CHpenetration fraction,Use this penetration fraction according to § 1065.660(b)(2)(ii), § 1065.660(d)(1)(ii), or § 1065.665, as applicable.

(11) Repeat the steps in paragraphs (e)(6) through (e)(10) of this section, but with the CHanalytical gas mixture instead of CH. The result will be the CHpenetration fraction, PF. Use this penetration fraction according to § 1065.660(b)(2)(ii), § 1065.660(c)(1)(ii), or § 1065.665, as applicable.
