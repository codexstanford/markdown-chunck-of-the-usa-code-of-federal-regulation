####### Process vent

means a gaseous emission stream from a unit operation where the gaseous emission stream is discharged to the atmosphere either directly or after passing through one or more control, recovery, or recapture devices. Unit operations that may have process vents are condensers, distillation units, reactors, or other unit operations within the APPU. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 parts per million volume (ppmv) organic HAP, as determined through process knowledge that no organic HAP are present in the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in ยง 63.1414(d)(6); test data using the test methods specified in ยง 63.1414(a); or any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part are not considered process vents. Process vents exclude relief valve discharges, gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s), and leaks from equipment regulated under ยง 63.1410. Process vents that are serving as control devices are not subject to additional control requirements.
