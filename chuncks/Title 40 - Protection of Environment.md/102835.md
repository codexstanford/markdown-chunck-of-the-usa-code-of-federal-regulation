######## Procedure for a FID calibrated with CH,bypassing the NMC,RFPF,PF

(f),. If you use a FID with an NMC that is calibrated with CH, by bypassing the NMC, determine its combined ethane (CH) response factor and penetration fraction,, as well as its CHpenetration fraction,, as follows:

(1) Select CHand CHanalytical gas mixtures and ensure that both mixtures meet the specifications of § 1065.750. Select a CHconcentration that you would use for spanning the FID during emission testing and select a CHconcentration that is typical of the peak NMHC concentration expected at the hydrocarbon standard or equal to the THC analyzer's span value. For CHanalyzers with multiple ranges, perform this procedure on the highest range used for emission testing.

(2) Start and operate the nonmethane cutter according to the manufacturer's instructions, including any temperature optimization.

(3) Confirm that the FID analyzer meets all the specifications of § 1065.360.

(4) Start and operate the FID analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

(5) Zero and span the FID as you would during emission testing. Span the FID by bypassing the cutter and by using CHspan gas. Note that you must span the FID on a Cbasis. For example, if your span gas has a methane reference value of 100 µmol/mol, the correct FID response to that span gas is 100 µmol/mol because there is one carbon atom per CHmolecule.

(6) Introduce the CHanalytical gas mixture upstream of the nonmethane cutter. Use good engineering judgment to address the effect of hydrocarbon contamination if your point of introduction is vastly different from the point of zero/span gas introduction.

(7) Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization time may include time to purge the nonmethane cutter and to account for the analyzer's response.

(8) While the analyzer measures a stable concentration, record 30 seconds of sampled data. Calculate the arithmetic mean of these data points.
