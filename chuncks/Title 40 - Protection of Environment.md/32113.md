####### Process condenser

means a condenser functioning so as to recover material as an integral part of a unit operation(s). A process condenser shall support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of equipment operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers when the vacuum source is being operated. A condenser may be a process condenser for some batch emission episodes and, when meeting certain conditions, may be a control device for other batch emission episodes.
