###### Standards and Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.11516 What are my standards and management practices?
######## Standards for welding.

(f)If you own or operate a new or existing welding affected source, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section for each welding operation that uses materials that contain MFHAP, as defined in ยง 63.11522, "What definitions apply to this subpart?", or has the potential to emit MFHAP. If your welding affected source uses 2,000 pounds or more per year of welding rod containing one or more MFHAP (calculated on a rolling 12-month basis), you must demonstrate that management practices or fume control measures are being implemented by complying with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(3) through (8) of this section. The requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section do not apply when welding operations are being performed that do not use any materials containing MFHAP or do not have the potential to emit MFHAP.

(1) You must operate all equipment, capture, and control devices associated with welding operations according to manufacturer's instructions. You must demonstrate compliance with this requirement by maintaining a record of the manufacturer's specifications for the capture and control devices, as specified by the requirements in ยง 63.11519(c)(4), "Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements."

(2) You must implement one or more of the management practices specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (v) of this section to minimize emissions of MFHAP, as practicable, while maintaining the required welding quality through the application of sound engineering judgment.

(i) Use welding processes with reduced fume generation capabilities (e.g., gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-also called metal inert gas welding (MIG));

(ii) Use welding process variations (e.g., pulsed current GMAW), which can reduce fume generation rates;

(iii) Use welding filler metals, shielding gases, carrier gases, or other process materials which are capable of reduced welding fume generation;

(iv) Optimize welding process variables (e.g., electrode diameter, voltage, amperage, welding angle, shield gas flow rate, travel speed) to reduce the amount of welding fume generated; and

(v) Use a welding fume capture and control system, operated according to the manufacturer's specifications.
