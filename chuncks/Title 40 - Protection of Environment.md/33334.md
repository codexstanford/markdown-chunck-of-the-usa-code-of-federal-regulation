####### ยง 63.2262 How do I conduct performance tests and establish operating requirements?
######## Nondetect data.

(g)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, all nondetect data (ยง 63.2292) must be treated as one-half of the method detection limit when determining total HAP, formaldehyde, methanol, or total hydrocarbon (THC) emission rates.

(2) When showing compliance with the production-based compliance options in Table 1A to this subpart, you may treat emissions of an individual HAP as zero if all three of the performance test runs result in a nondetect measurement, and the method detection limit is less than or equal to 1 parts per million by volume, dry basis (ppmvd). Otherwise, nondetect data for individual HAP must be treated as one-half of the method detection limit.
