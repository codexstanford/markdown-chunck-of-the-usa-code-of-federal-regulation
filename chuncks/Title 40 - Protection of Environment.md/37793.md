####### ยง 63.9322 How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
######## Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.

(a)You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:

(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a potential to emit (PTE) and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.

(2) All engine test operations creating exhaust gases for which the test is applicable are conducted within the capture system.
