####### Preparation of test substance.

(7)(i) Liquid test substances are generally used undiluted, except as indicated in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.

(ii) Solids should be pulverized when possible. The substance should be moistened sufficiently with water or, when necessary, a suitable vehicle to ensure good contact with the skin. When a vehicle is used, the influence of the vehicle on toxicity of, and penetration of the skin by, the test substance should be taken into account.

(iii) The volume of application should be kept constant, e.g., less than 300 µL for the rat; different concentrations of test solution shall be prepared for different dose levels.
