(4)-(5) [Reserved]

(6) For each product (leaving the coal-to-liquid facility) listed in Table MM-1 of subpart MM of this part, report the total annual quantity in metric tons or barrels. For natural gas liquids, quantity shall reflect the individual components of the product. Those products that enter the facility, but are not reported in (a)(2), shall not be reported under this paragraph.

(7) For each product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that was produced by blending a fossil fuel-based product with a biomass-based product, report the percent of the volume reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that is fossil fuel-based (excluding any denaturant that may be present in any ethanol product).

(8) [Reserved]

(iii) The carbon share test results in percent mass.

(iv) The standard method used to test carbon share.

(v) The calculated COemissions factor in metric tons COper barrel or per metric ton of product.

(10) For every non-solid feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 in § 98.393(f)(2) was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(ii) The standard method used to test density.

(11) For every product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 in § 98.393(f)(2) was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The number of samples collected according to § 98.394(c).

(ii) The sampling standard method used.

(iii) The carbon share test results in percent mass.

(iv) The standard method used to test carbon share.

(v) The calculated COemissions factor in metric tons COper barrel or metric ton of product.

(12) For every non-solid product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for which Calculation Method 2 of subpart MM of this part was used to determine an emissions factor, report:

(i) The density test results in metric tons per barrel.

(ii) The standard method used to test density.

(13) [Reserved]

(14) For each specific type of biomass that enters the coal-to-liquid facility to be co-processed with fossil fuel-based feedstock to produce a product reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, report the annual quantity in metric tons or barrels.

(15) [Reserved]

(16) The COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each feedstock reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that were calculated according to § 98.393(b) or (h).

(17) The COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each product (leaving the coal-to-liquid facility) reported in paragraph (a)(6) of this section that were calculated according to § 98.393(a) or (h).

(18) Annual COemissions in metric tons that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of each type of biomass feedstock co-processed with fossil fuel-based feedstocks reported in paragraph (a)(14) of this section, calculated according to § 98.393(c).

(19) Annual COemissions that would result from the complete combustion or oxidation of all products, calculated according to § 98.393(d).

(20) Annual quantity of bulk NGLs in metric tons or barrels received for processing during the reporting year. Report only quantities of bulk NGLs not reported in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(b) In addition to the information required by § 98.3(c), each importer shall report all of the following information at the corporate level:

(1) [Reserved]

(2) For each product listed in Table MM-1 of subpart MM of this part, report the total annual quantity in metric tons or barrels. For natural gas liquids, quantity shall reflect the individual components of the product as listed in Table MM-1 of subpart MM of this part.
