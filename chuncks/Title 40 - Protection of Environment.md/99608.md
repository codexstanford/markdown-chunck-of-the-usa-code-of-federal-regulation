####### Deactivating derates.

(e)Program the engine to deactivate derates as follows:

(1) Evaluate whether the detected fault condition continues to apply. Deactivate derates if the engine confirms that the detected fault condition is resolved.

(2) Allow a generic scan tool to deactivate inducement-related fault codes while the vehicle is not in motion.

(3) Treat any detected fault condition that recurs within 40 hours of engine operation as the same detected fault condition, which would restart the derate at the same point in the derate schedule that the system last deactivated the derate.
