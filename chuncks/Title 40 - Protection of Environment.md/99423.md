####### Testing requirements.

(b)Annually test a sample of locomotives in your fleet. For purposes of this section, your fleet includes both the locomotives that you own and the locomotives that you are leasing. Use the test procedures in subpart F of this part, unless we approve different procedures.

(1) Except for the cases described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, test at least 0.075 percent of the average number of locomotives in your fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., determine the number to be tested by multiplying the number of locomotives in the fleet by 0.00075 and rounding up to the next whole number).

(2) We may allow you to test a smaller number of locomotives if we determine that the number of tests otherwise required by this section is not necessary.
