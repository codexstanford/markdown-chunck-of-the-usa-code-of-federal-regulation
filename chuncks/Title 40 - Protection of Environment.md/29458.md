####### Ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve inspections.

(8)Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in ยง 63.1102(c), the owner or operator must conduct ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve inspections as specified in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) Prior to decoking operation, inspect the applicable ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s) to confirm that the radiant tube(s) being decoked is completely isolated from the ethylene production process so that no emissions generated from decoking operations are sent to the ethylene production process. If poor isolation is identified, then the owner or operator must rectify the isolation issue prior to continuing decoking operations to prevent leaks into the ethylene production process.

(ii) Prior to returning the ethylene cracking furnace to normal operations after a decoking operation, inspect the applicable ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s) to confirm that the radiant tube(s) that was decoked is completely isolated from the decoking pot or furnace firebox such that no emissions are sent from the radiant tube(s) to the decoking pot or furnace firebox once the ethylene cracking furnace returns to normal operation. If poor isolation is identified, then the owner or operator must rectify the isolation issue prior to continuing normal operations to prevent product from escaping to the atmosphere through the decoking pot or furnace firebox.
