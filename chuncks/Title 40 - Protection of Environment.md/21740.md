###### ยง 60.5432a How do I determine whether a well is a low pressure well using the low pressure well equation?
####### p,psia,F

(3) Calculate the value of the applicable natural gas specific gravity that would result from a separator pressure of 100 psig, &#x3B3;, using the following equation with: Separator at standard conditions (pressure,= 14.7 (), temperature, T = 60 ()); the oil API gravity at the well site, &#x3B3;; and the gas specific gravity at the separator under standard conditions, &#x3B3;= 0.75:
