####### ยง 63.1571 How and when do I conduct a performance test or other initial compliance demonstration?
######## Can I change my operating limit?

(e)You may change the established operating limit by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) You may change your established operating limit for a continuous parameter monitoring system by doing an additional performance test, a performance test in conjunction with an engineering assessment, or an engineering assessment to verify that, at the new operating limit, you are in compliance with the applicable emission limitation.

(2) You must establish a revised operating limit for your continuous parameter monitoring system if you make any change in process or operating conditions that could affect control system performance or you change designated conditions after the last performance or compliance tests were done. You can establish the revised operating limit as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(3) You may change your site-specific opacity operating limit or Ni operating limit only by doing a new performance test.
