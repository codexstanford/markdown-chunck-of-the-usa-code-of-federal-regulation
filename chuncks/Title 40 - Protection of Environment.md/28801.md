() The running average reflects a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.

(C) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.

(D) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.
