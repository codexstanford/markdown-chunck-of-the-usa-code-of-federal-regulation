###### Analytical System Leak check.

8.2.2Leak check the FTIR cell under vacuum and under pressure (greater than ambient). Leak check connecting tubing and inlet manifold under pressure.

8.2.2.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute pressure P. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the change in pressure ΔPafter 2 minutes.

8.2.2.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure ΔPafter 2 minutes.

8.2.2.3 Measure the barometric pressure, Pin mmHg.
