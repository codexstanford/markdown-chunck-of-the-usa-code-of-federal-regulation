###### ยง 63.1426 Process vent requirements for determining organic HAP concentration, control efficiency, and aggregated organic HAP emission reduction for a PMPU.
####### 1,5

(B) Testing of process vents from batch unit operations shall be conducted at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)() through () of this section. Worst-case conditions are limited to the maximum production allowed in a State or Federal permit or regulation and the conditions specified in ยง 63.1437(a)(1). Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured at 15-minute intervals, or at least once during the emission episode. The organic HAP or TOC concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of the test, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (at approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate.
