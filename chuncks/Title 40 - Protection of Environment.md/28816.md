## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart SS - National Emission Standards for Closed Vent Systems, Control Devices, Recovery Devices and Routing to a Fuel Gas System or a Process
###### ยง 63.998 Recordkeeping requirements.
####### Regulated source and control equipment start-up, shutdown and malfunction records.

(3)(i) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment used to comply with this part during which excess emissions (as defined in a referencing subpart) occur.

(ii) For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions occur, records that the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing control device emissions to a backup control device (e.g., the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a "checklist," or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
