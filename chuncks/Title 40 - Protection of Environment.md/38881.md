######## Target HAP containing coating

means a spray-applied coating that contains any individual target HAP that is a carcinogen at a concentration greater than 0.1 percent by mass, or greater than 1.0 percent by mass for any other individual target HAP compound. For the target HAP, this corresponds to coatings that contain cadmium, chromium, lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by mass (of the metal), and materials that contain manganese in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by mass (of the metal). For the purpose of determining whether materials you use contain the target HAP compounds, you may rely on formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the material safety data sheet (MSDS), as long as it represents each target HAP compound in the material that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for carcinogens and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other target HAP compounds. The target HAP content of coatings is based on the HAP content of the coating as applied, not on the HAP content of the coating components as purchased from the coating supplier. However, coatings that do not contain the target HAP based on the HAP content as purchased will also meet the definition based on the HAP content as applied.
