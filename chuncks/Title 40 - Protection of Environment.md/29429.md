####### Polycarbonate production

means a process engaged in the production of a special class of polyester formed from any dihydroxy compound and any carbonate diester or by ester exchange. Polycarbonate may be produced by solution or emulsion polymerization, although other methods may be used. A typical method for the manufacture of polycarbonate includes the reaction of bisphenol-A with phosgene in the presence of pyridine or other catalyst to form polycarbonate. Methylene chloride or other solvents are used in this polymerization reaction.
