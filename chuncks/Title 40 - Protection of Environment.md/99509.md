means relating to a locomotive that is not covered by a certificate of conformity prior to importation or being offered for importation (or for which such coverage has not been adequately demonstrated to EPA); or a locomotive which was originally covered by a certificate of conformity, but which is not in a certified configuration, or otherwise does not comply with the conditions of that certificate of conformity. (Domestic locomotives and locomotive engines not covered by a certificate of conformity prior to their introduction into U.S. commerce are considered to be noncomplying locomotives and locomotive engines.)
