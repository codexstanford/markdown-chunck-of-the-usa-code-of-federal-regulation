####### Sample Application.

(vii)Samples can be spotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets free-hand or with the aid of a template. For free-hand application, draw a grid of squares approximately 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters (cm) on the nitrocellulose sheets using a soft pencil. Spot 5-10 µl portions to the center of each square for a total sample volume of 20 µl. For template aided sample application a washerless microliter capacity sample application manifold is used. Position the nitrocellulose sheet in the sample application device as recommended by the manufacturer and spot a 20 µl sample in one application. Do not wet the nitrocellulose or any support elements prior to sample application. Do not apply vacuum during or after sample application. After spotting samples (using either method), let the sheets air dry. The sheets can be stored at room temperature for several days after sample application.
