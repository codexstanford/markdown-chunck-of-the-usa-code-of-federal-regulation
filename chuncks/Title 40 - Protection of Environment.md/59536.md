###### ยง 168.75 Procedures for exporting unregistered pesticides - purchaser acknowledgement statements.
####### Products subject to the requirement.

(a)EPA will not consider an exporter of an unregistered pesticide to be in violation of FIFRA section 17(a)(2) if, prior to export of the pesticide, the exporter submits to EPA a statement signed by the foreign purchaser which affirms that the purchaser is aware that the pesticide is not registered for use in the United States and cannot be sold for use in the United States. The exporter must also include with the submission of the purchaser acknowledgement statement to EPA, a certification signed by the exporter affirming that the export did not occur until the statement signed by the foreign purchaser was obtained by the exporter. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all pesticide products produced for export which cannot be sold for use in the United States in the form that they are produced for export, are considered to be unregistered pesticides. This includes pesticides which are of a different formulation, including composition (except for variation within certified limits), or type of formulation, and pesticides which are packaged for use patterns for which they are not registered, which may be evidenced by package type or label use statements. This also includes unregistered products which are under development as pesticidal products and which are being exported for research testing.
