###### Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
####### ยง 63.10005 What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date must I conduct them?
######## Performance testing requirements.,e.g.,

(b)If you choose to use performance testing to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emissions limits in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart for your EGUs, you must conduct the tests according to 40 CFR 63.10007 and Table 5 to this subpart. Notwithstanding these requirements, when Table 5 specifies the use of isokinetic EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26A, or 29 for a stack test, if concurrent measurement of the stack gas flow rate or moisture content is needed to convert the pollutant concentrations to units of the standard, separate determination of these parameters using EPA test Method 2 or EPA test Method 4 is not necessary. Instead, the stack gas flow rate and moisture content can be determined from data that are collected during the EPA test Method 5, 5D, 6, 26A, or 29 test (pitot tube (delta P) readings, moisture collected in the impingers, etc.). For the purposes of the initial compliance demonstration, you may use test data and results from a performance test conducted prior to the date on which compliance is required as specified in 40 CFR 63.9984, provided that the following conditions are fully met:

(1) For a performance test based on stack test data, the test was conducted no more than 12 calendar months prior to the date on which compliance is required as specified in ยง 63.9984;

(2) For a performance test based on data from a certified CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system, the test consists of all valid CMS data recorded in the 30 boiler operating days immediately preceding that date;

(3) The performance test was conducted in accordance with all applicable requirements in ยง 63.10007 and Table 5 to this subpart;
