####### ยง 63.1220 What are the replacement standards for hazardous waste burning cement kilns?
######## Cement kilns with in-line kiln raw mills,General.

(d)-(1)(i) You must conduct performance testing when the raw mill is on-line and when the mill is off-line to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must establish separate operating parameter limits under ยง 63.1209 for each mode of operation, except as provided by paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) and (d)(1)(v) of this section.

(ii) You must document in the operating record each time you change from one mode of operation to the alternate mode and begin complying with the operating parameter limits for that alternate mode of operation.

(iii) You must calculate rolling averages for operating parameter limits as provided by ยง 63.1209(q)(2).

(iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the mill is on-line.

(v) In lieu of conducting a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standards for the mode of operation when the raw mill is on-line, you may specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the same operating parameter limits required under ยง 63.1209(k) for the mode of operation when the raw mill is on-line as you establish during performance testing for the mode of operation when the raw mill is off-line.
