######## Advance match.

(f)(1) A Cooperative Agreement for a site-specific response entered into after October 17, 1986, cannot authorize a State to contribute funds during remedial planning and then apply those contributions to the remedial action cost share (advance match).

(2) A State may seek reimbursement for costs incurred under Cooperative Agreements which authorize advance match.

(3) Reimbursements are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

(4) If the State does not seek reimbursement, EPA will apply the advance match to off-set the State's required cost share for remedial action at the site. The State may not use advance match for credit at any other site, nor may the State receive reimbursement until the conclusion of CERCLA-funded remedial response activities. Also, the State may not use advance match for credit against cost share obligations for Core Program Cooperative Agreements.

(5) Claims for advance match are subject to verification by audit.
