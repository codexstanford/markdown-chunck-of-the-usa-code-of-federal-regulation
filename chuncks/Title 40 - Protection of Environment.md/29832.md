###### Interim Emissions Standards and Operating Limits For Incinerators, Cement Kilns, and Lightweight Aggregate Kilns
####### ยง 63.1204 What are the standards for hazardous waste burning cement kilns that are effective until compliance with the standards under ยง 63.1220?
######## Cement kilns with in-line kiln raw mills,General.

(d)-(1)(i) You must conduct performance testing when the raw mill is on-line and when the mill is off-line to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must establish separate operating parameter limits under ยง 63.1209 for each mode of operation, except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

(ii) You must document in the operating record each time you change from one mode of operation to the alternate mode and begin complying with the operating parameter limits for that alternate mode of operation.

(iii) You must calculate rolling averages for operating parameter limits as provided by ยง 63.1209(q)(2).

(iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the mill is on-line.
