####### Draft permit

means a document prepared under ยง 124.6 indicating the Director's tentative decision to issue or deny, modify, revoke and reissue, terminate, or reissue a permit. A notice of intent to terminate a permit, and a notice of intent to deny a permit, as discussed in ยง 124.5, are types of draft permits. A denial of a request for modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, as discussed in ยง 124.5 is not a "draft permit." A proposed permit is not a draft permit.
