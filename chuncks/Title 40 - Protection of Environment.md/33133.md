####### Baghouses equipped with bag leak detection systems.

(2)The owner or operator demonstrates compliance with the bag leak detection system requirements by submitting reports as required by ยง 63.1659(b)(5) showing that the alarm on the system does not sound for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month period. Calculate the percentage of total operating time the alarm on the bag leak detection system sounds as follows:

(i) Do not include alarms that occur due solely to a malfunction of the bag leak detection system in the calculation.

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) Count 1 hour of alarm time for each alarm where the owner or operator initiates procedures to determine the cause within 1 hour of the alarm.

(iv) Count the actual time it takes the owner or operator to initiate procedures to determine the cause of the alarm for each alarm where the owner or operator does not initiate procedures to determine the cause within 1 hour of the alarm.

(v) Calculate the percentage of time the alarm on the bag leak detection system sounds as the ratio of the sum of alarm times to the total operating time multiplied by 100.
