(13) Calculate the percent difference betweenand its reference gas concentration. Calculate the percent difference betweenand its reference gas concentration. Calculate the percent difference betweenand its reference gas concentration. Determine the maximum percent difference of the three. This is the Ointerference.

(14) If the Ointerference is within +/-2%, the FID passes the Ointerference verification; otherwise perform one or more of the following to address the deficiency:

(i) Repeat the verification to determine if a mistake was made during the procedure.

(ii) Select zero and span gases for emission testing that contain higher or lower Oconcentrations and repeat the verification.
