(2) If a stationary boiler or stationary combustion turbine that, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is not a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit begins to combust fossil fuel or to serve a generator with nameplate capacity of more than 25 MWe producing electricity for sale, the unit shall become a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the first date on which it both combusts fossil fuel and serves such generator.

(b) Any unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) that otherwise is a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit under paragraph (a) of this section and that meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i) of this section shall not be a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit:

(ii) If, after qualifying under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as not being a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit, a unit subsequently no longer meets all the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the unit shall become a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit starting on the earlier of January 1 after the first calendar year during which the unit first no longer qualifies as a cogeneration unit or January 1 after the first calendar year during which the unit no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(B) With an average annual fuel consumption of fossil fuel for the first 3 consecutive calendar years of operation starting no earlier than 2005 of less than 20 percent (on a Btu basis) and an average annual fuel consumption of fossil fuel for any 3 consecutive calendar years thereafter of less than 20 percent (on a Btu basis).

(ii) If, after qualifying under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section as not being a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit, a unit subsequently no longer meets all the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the unit shall become a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit starting on the earlier of January 1 after the first calendar year during which the unit first no longer qualifies as a solid waste incineration unit or January 1 after the first 3 consecutive calendar years after 2005 for which the unit has an average annual fuel consumption of fossil fuel of 20 percent or more. The unit shall thereafter continue to be a CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 unit.
