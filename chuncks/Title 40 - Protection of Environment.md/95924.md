###### ยง 797.1950 Mysid shrimp chronic toxicity test.
####### Numerical.

(ii)(A) The number of dead mysids, cumulative young per female, and body lengths of male and female mysids shall be recorded during each definitive test. Appropriate statistical analyses shall provide a goodness-of-fit determination for the day 7, 14, 21 and 28 adult (Gl) death concentration-response curves.

(B) A 7-, 14-, 21- and 28-day LC, based on adult (Gl) death, and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals shall be calculated. Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., analysis of variance, mean separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical effects on chronic test criteria (cumulative mortality of adults, cumulative number of young per female and body lengths of adult male and females) on designated days. An MATC shall be calculated using these chronic tests criteria.
