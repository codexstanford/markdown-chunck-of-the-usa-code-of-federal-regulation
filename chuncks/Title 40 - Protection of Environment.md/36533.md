####### 10.1.3 Up-Scale Calibration.

Individually introduce each calibration gas to the measurement system (e.g., at the calibration assembly) and record the start time. Record all EC cell output responses and the flow rate during this "sample conditioning phase" once per minute until readings are constant for at least two minutes. Then begin the "measurement data phase" and record readings every 15 seconds for a total of two minutes, or as otherwise required. Finally, perform the "refresh phase" by introducing dry air, free from CO and other combustion gases, until readings are constant for at least two consecutive minutes. Then repeat the steps in this section at least once to verify the calibration for each component gas. Introduce all gases to flow through the entire sample handling system (i.e., at the exit end of the sampling probe or the calibration assembly).
