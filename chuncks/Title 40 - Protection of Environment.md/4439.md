###### Zero air.

4.4.1The zero air must be free of contaminants which would cause a detectable response from the Oanalyzer, and it must be free of NO, CH, and other species which react with O. A procedure for generating suitable zero air is given in Reference 13. As shown in Figure 2, the zero air supplied to the photometer cell for the Ireference measurement must be derived from the same source as the zero air used for generation of the Oconcentration to be assayed (I measurement). When using the photometer to certify a transfer standard having its own source of O, see Reference 12 for guidance on meeting this requirement.
