####### ยง 1065.345 Vacuum-side leak verification.
######## Low-flow leak test.

(c)Test a sampling system for low-flow leaks as follows:

(1) Seal the probe end of the system by taking one of the following steps:

(i) Cap or plug the end of the sample probe.

(ii) Disconnect the transfer line at the probe and cap or plug the transfer line.

(iii) Close a leak-tight valve located in the sample transfer line within 92 cm of the probe.

(2) Operate all vacuum pumps. After stabilizing, verify that the flow through the vacuum-side of the sampling system is less than 0.5% of the system's normal in-use flow rate. You may estimate typical analyzer and bypass flows as an approximation of the system's normal in-use flow rate.
