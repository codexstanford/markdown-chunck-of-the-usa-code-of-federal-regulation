###### Timing errors.

6.8Samplers are normally controlled by clock timers set to start and stop the sampler at midnight. Errors in the nominal 1,440-min sampling period may result from a power interruption during the sampling period or from a discrepancy between the start or stop time recorded on the filter information record and the actual start or stop time of the sampler. Such discrepancies may be caused by (1) poor resolution of the timer set-points, (2) timer error due to power interruption, (3) missetting of the timer, or (4) timer malfunction. In general, digital electronic timers have much better set-point resolution than mechanical timers, but require a battery backup system to maintain continuity of operation after a power interruption. A continuous flow recorder or elapsed time meter provides an indication of the sampler run-time, as well as indication of any power interruption during the sampling period and is therefore recommended.
