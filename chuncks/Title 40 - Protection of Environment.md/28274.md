####### Flexographic print station

means a print station on which a flexographic printing operation is conducted. A flexographic print station includes an anilox roller that transfers material to a raised image (type or art) on a plate cylinder. The material is then transferred from the image on the plate cylinder to the web or sheet to be printed. A flexographic print station may include a fountain roller to transfer material from the reservoir to the anilox roller, or material may be transferred directly from the reservoir to the anilox roller. The materials applied are of a fluid, rather than paste, consistency.
