###### Appendix A to Subpart UUUUU of Part 63 - Hg Monitoring Provisions
####### Electrical Output-Based Hg Emission Rates.

6.2.2Calculate electrical output-based Hg emission limits in units of lb/GWh, according to sections 6.2.2.1 through 6.2.2.3 of this appendix.

6.2.2.1 Calculate the Hg mass emissions for each operating hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters, using Equation A-2 of this section (for wet-basis measurements of Hg concentration) or Equation A-3 of this section (for dry-basis measurements), as applicable:

(Use unadjusted flow rate values; bias adjustment is not required)

6.2.2.2 Use Equation A-4 of this section to calculate the emission rate for each unit or stack operating hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters.

6.2.2.3 The applicable gross output-based Hg emission rate limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart must be met on a 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day rolling average basis, except as otherwise provided in ยง 63.10009(a)(2). Use Equation A-5 of this appendix to calculate the Hg emission rate for each averaging period.
