() For purposes of determining the most stringent emissions limitation, applicable emissions limitations shall be converted to lbs/mmBtu in accordance with appendix B of this part. If an applicable emissions limitation cannot be converted to a unit-specific limitation in lbs/mmBtu under appendix B of this part, then the limitation shall not be used in determining the most stringent emissions limitation. Where the power production facility is subject to different emissions limitations depending on the type of fuel it uses during the calendar year, the most stringent emissions limitation shall be determined separately with regard to each type of fuel and the resulting limitation with the highest amount of lbs/mmBtu shall be treated as the facility's most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable emissions limitation.
