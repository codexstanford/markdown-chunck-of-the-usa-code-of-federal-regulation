###### ยง 1036.535 Determining steady-state engine fuel maps and fuel consumption at idle.
####### Steady-state fuel mapping.

(b)Determine steady-state fuel-consumption rates for each engine configuration over a series of paired engine speed and torque setpoints as described in this paragraph (b). For example, if you test a high-output (parent) configuration and create a different (child) configuration that uses the same fueling strategy but limits the engine operation to be a subset of that from the high-output configuration, you may use the fuel-consumption rates for the reduced number of mapped points for the low-output configuration, as long as the narrower map includes at least 70 points. Perform fuel mapping as follows:

(1) Generate the fuel-mapping sequence of engine speed and torque setpoints as follows:
