####### Proposed disposal site determinations.

(f)(1) Each disposal site shall be specified through the application of these Guidelines. The mixing zone shall be confined to the smallest practicable zone within each specified disposal site that is consistent with the type of dispersion determined to be appropriate by the application of these Guidelines. In a few special cases under unique environmental conditions, where there is adequate justification to show that widespread dispersion by natural means will result in no significantly adverse environmental effects, the discharged material may be intended to be spread naturally in a very thin layer over a large area of the substrate rather than be contained within the disposal site.

(2) The permitting authority and the Regional Administrator shall consider the following factors in determining the acceptability of a proposed mixing zone:

(i) Depth of water at the disposal site;

(ii) Current velocity, direction, and variability at the disposal site;

(iii) Degree of turbulence;

(iv) Stratification attributable to causes such as obstructions, salinity or density profiles at the disposal site;

(v) Discharge vessel speed and direction, if appropriate;

(vi) Rate of discharge;

(vii) Ambient concentration of constituents of interest;

(viii) Dredged material characteristics, particularly concentrations of constituents, amount of material, type of material (sand, silt, clay, etc.) and settling velocities;

(ix) Number of discharge actions per unit of time;

(x) Other factors of the disposal site that affect the rates and patterns of mixing.
