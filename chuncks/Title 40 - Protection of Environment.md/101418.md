####### Fuels.

(c)Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, for all the testing we require in this part, except as specified in ยง 1045.515.

(1) Use gasoline meeting the specifications described in 40 CFR 1065.710(c) for general testing. For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use.

(2) You may alternatively use ethanol-blended fuel meeting the specifications described in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) for general testing without our advance approval. If you use the ethanol-blended fuel for certifying a given engine family, you may also use it for production-line testing or any other testing you perform for that engine family under this part. If you use the ethanol-blended fuel for certifying a given engine family, we may use the ethanol-blended fuel or the specified neat gasoline test fuel with that engine family.
