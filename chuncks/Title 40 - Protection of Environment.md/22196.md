###### 7.1 Calibration Gas.

What calibration gases do I need? Your calibration gas must be NO in Nand certified (or recertified) within an uncertainty of 2.0 percent in accordance with "EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards" September 1997, as amended August 25, 1999, EPA-600/R-97/121. Blended gases meeting the Traceability Protocol are allowed if the additional gas components are shown not to interfere with the analysis. If a zero gas is used for the low-level gas, it must meet the requirements under the definition for "zero air material" in 40 CFR 72.2. The calibration gas must not be used after its expiration date. Except for applications under part 75 of this chapter, it is acceptable to prepare calibration gas mixtures from EPA Traceability Protocol gases in accordance with Method 205 in appendix M to part 51 of this chapter. For part 75 applications, the use of Method 205 is subject to the approval of the Administrator. The goal and recommendation for selecting calibration gases is to bracket the sample concentrations. The following calibration gas concentrations are required:
