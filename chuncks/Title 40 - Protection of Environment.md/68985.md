####### Groundwater monitoring.

(f)Testing or monitoring for liquids on the groundwater must meet the following requirements:

(1) The regulated substance stored is immiscible in water and has a specific gravity of less than one;

(2) Groundwater is never more than 20 feet from the ground surface and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between the UST system and the monitoring wells or devices is not less than 0.01 cm/sec (e.g., the soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium sands, coarse silts or other permeable materials);

(3) The slotted portion of the monitoring well casing must be designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack into the well and to allow entry of regulated substance on the water table into the well under both high and low groundwater conditions;

(4) Monitoring wells shall be sealed from the ground surface to the top of the filter pack;

(5) Monitoring wells or devices intercept the excavation zone or are as close to it as is technically feasible;

(6) The continuous monitoring devices or manual methods used can detect the presence of at least one-eighth of an inch of free product on top of the groundwater in the monitoring wells;

(7) Within and immediately below the UST system excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will detect releases from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and

(8) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.
