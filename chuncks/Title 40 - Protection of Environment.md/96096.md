####### Physical measurements.

(8)For inhalation studies, measurements or monitoring should be made of the following:

(i) The rate of air flow shall be monitored continuously and recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.

(ii) During each exposure period the actual concentrations of the test substance shall be held as constant as practicable, monitored continuously and recorded at least three times during the test period: at the beginning, at an intermediate time and at the end of the period.

(iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analyses shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of particle size, distribution, and homogeneity of the exposure stream.

(iv) Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously, but shoud be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
