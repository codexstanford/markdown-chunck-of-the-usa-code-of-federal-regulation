####### Data in lieu of trial burn.

(6)The owner or operator may seek an exemption from the trial burn requirements to demonstrate conformance with §§ 266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and § 270.66 by providing the information required by § 270.66 from previous compliance testing of the device in conformance with § 266.103 of this chapter, or from compliance testing or trial or operational burns of similar boilers or industrial furnaces burning similar hazardous wastes under similar conditions. If data from a similar device is used to support a trial burn waiver, the design and operating information required by § 270.66 must be provided for both the similar device and the device to which the data is to be applied, and a comparison of the design and operating information must be provided. The Director shall approve a permit application without a trial burn if he finds that the hazardous wastes are sufficiently similar, the devices are sufficiently similar, the operating conditions are sufficiently similar, and the data from other compliance tests, trial burns, or operational burns are adequate to specify (under § 266.102 of this chapter) operating conditions that will ensure conformance with § 266.102(c) of this chapter. In addition, the following information shall be submitted:

(i) For a waiver from any trial burn:

(A) A description and analysis of the hazardous waste to be burned compared with the hazardous waste for which data from compliance testing, or operational or trial burns are provided to support the contention that a trial burn is not needed;

(B) The design and operating conditions of the boiler or industrial furnace to be used, compared with that for which comparative burn data are available; and

(C) Such supplemental information as the Director finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.

(ii) For a waiver of the DRE trial burn, the basis for selection of POHCs used in the other trial or operational burns which demonstrate compliance with the DRE performance standard in § 266.104(a) of this chapter. This analysis should specify the constituents in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, that the applicant has identified in the hazardous waste for which a permit is sought, and any differences from the POHCs in the hazardous waste for which burn data are provided.
