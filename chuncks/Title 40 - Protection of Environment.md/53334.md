####### Response planning levels.

(5)The response plan shall include discussion of specific planning scenarios for:

(i) A worst case discharge, as calculated using the appropriate worksheet in appendix D to this part. In cases where the Regional Administrator determines that the worst case discharge volume calculated by the facility is not appropriate, the Regional Administrator may specify the worst case discharge amount to be used for response planning at the facility. For complexes, the worst case planning quantity shall be the larger of the amounts calculated for each component of the facility;

(ii) A discharge of 2,100 gallons or less, provided that this amount is less than the worst case discharge amount. For complexes, this planning quantity shall be the larger of the amounts calculated for each component of the facility; and

(iii) A discharge greater than 2,100 gallons and less than or equal to 36,000 gallons or 10 percent of the capacity of the largest tank at the facility, whichever is less, provided that this amount is less than the worst case discharge amount. For complexes, this planning quantity shall be the larger of the amounts calculated for each component of the facility.
