() A satellite group to evaluate fertility shall be established. Control males shall be cohabited with control females, and males and females administered the high dose shall be cohabited. Endpoints to be evaluated shall include percent mated; percent pregnant; length of gestation; litter size; viability at birth, on Day 4, and weaning, on Day 21; sex of the offspring; and litter weights at birth and Days 4, 7, 14, and 21. Litters shall be standardized on day 4 in accordance with the reproductive and fertility effects guideline, ยง 798.4700(c)(6)(iv) of this chapter. Gross examinations shall be made at least once each day and physical or behavioral anomalies in the dam or offspring shall be recorded. At weaning, dams shall be sacrificed and examined for resorption sites indicative of post-implantation loss. An additional 20 males and 40 females will have to be added to the subchronic study for this test. If the animals in the high dose group exhibit marked toxicity (e.g. greater than 20 percent weight loss), then the fertility tests shall be conducted in the next highest dose group.
