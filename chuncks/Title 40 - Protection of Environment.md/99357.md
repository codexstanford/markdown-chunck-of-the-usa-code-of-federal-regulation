####### Multi-engine locomotives.

(f)This paragraph (f) applies for locomotives using multiple engines where all engines are identical in all material respects. In cases where we allow engine dynamometer testing, you may test a single engine consistent with good engineering judgment, as long as you test it at the operating points at which the engines will operate when installed in the locomotive (excluding stopping and starting). Weigh the results to reflect the power demand/power-sharing of the in-use configuration for each notch setting.
