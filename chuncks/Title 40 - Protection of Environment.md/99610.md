####### Crankcase emissions.

(a)Engines may not discharge crankcase emissions into the ambient atmosphere throughout the useful life, other than those that are routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all operation, except as follow:

(1) Engines equipped with turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers for air induction may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing.

(2) If you take advantage of this exception, you must manufacture the engines so that all crankcase emissions can be routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part 1065. You must also account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when determining exhaust deterioration factors as described in ยง 1036.240(c)(5).
