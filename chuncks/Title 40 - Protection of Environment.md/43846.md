###### ยง 80.1426 How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel?
####### de minimis

(ii) In choosing an appropriate D code, producers and importers may disregard any incidental,feedstock contaminants that are impractical to remove and are related to customary feedstock production and transport.

(iii) Tables 1 and 2 to this section do not apply to, and impose no requirements with respect to, volumes of fuel for which RINs are generated pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

(iv) Pathways in Table 1 to this section and advanced technologies in Table 2 to this section also apply in cases where the renewable fuel producer is using a biointermediate.

(v) For the purposes of identifying the appropriate pathway in Table 1 to this section, biointermediates used for the production of renewable fuel are considered to be equivalent to the renewable biomass from which they were derived, with the following exceptions:

(A) Oil that is physically separated from any woody or herbaceous biomass and used to produce renewable fuel shall not generate D-code 3 or 7 RINs.

(B) Sugar or starch that is physically separated from cellulosic biomass and used to produce renewable fuel shall not generate D-code 3 or 7 RINs.

(vi) If a renewable fuel producer uses a biointermediate for the production of renewable fuel, additional requirements apply to both the renewable fuel producer and the biointermediate producer as described in ยง 80.1476.
