###### § 86.007-30 Certification.
####### For light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines.

(e)(1) Notwithstanding the fact that any vehicle configuration or engine family may be covered by a valid outstanding certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend such outstanding certificate of conformity in whole or in part with respect to such vehicle or engine configuration or engine family if:

(i) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator pursuant to § 86.1003; or

(ii) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of § 86.1003; or

(iii) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided pursuant to the requirements of § 86.1009; or

(iv) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted pursuant to § 86.1009; or

(v) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in § 86.1006 of this part and in a warrant or court order presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question; or

(vi) EPA Enforcement Officers are unable to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in § 86.1006 of this part because a manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities; or

(vii) The manufacturer refuses to or in fact does not comply with the requirements of §§ 86.1004(a), 86.1005, 86.1007, 86.1008, 86.1010, 86.1011, or 86.1013.

(2) The sanction of suspending a certificate may not be imposed for the reasons in paragraph (e)(1) (i), (ii), or (vii) of this section where such refusal or denial is caused by conditions and circumstances outside the control of the manufacturer which renders it impossible to comply with those requirements. Such conditions and circumstances shall include, but are not limited to, any uncontrollable factors which result in the temporary unavailability of equipment and personnel needed to conduct the required tests, such as equipment breakdown or failure or illness of personnel, but shall not include failure of the manufacturers to adequately plan for and provide the equipment and personnel needed to conduct the tests. The manufacturer will bear the burden of establishing the presence of the conditions and circumstances required by this paragraph.

(3) The sanction of suspending a certificate may be imposed for the reasons outlined in paragraph (e)(1)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section only when the infraction is substantial.

(4) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submitted false or inaccurate information or knowingly rendered inaccurate any test data or committed any other fraudulent acts, and such acts contributed substantially to the Administrator's original decision not to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, the Administrator may deem such certificate void from the date of such fraudulent act.

(5) In any case in which certification of a light-duty truck or heavy-duty engine is proposed to be suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section and in which the Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of § 86.1006 in fact occurred, if the manufacturer wishes to contend that, although the violation occurred, the vehicle or engine configuration or engine family in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant suspension of certification under paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, he shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.

(6) Any suspension of certification under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall:

(i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014; and

(ii) Not apply to vehicles or engines no longer in the hands of the manufacturer.

(7) Any voiding of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (e)(4) of this section shall be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014.

(8) Any voiding of the certificate under paragraph (a) (10) or (11) of this section will be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 86.1014.
