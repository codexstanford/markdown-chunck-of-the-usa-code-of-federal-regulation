######## Review and approval of eligibility demonstrations,Content of the eligibility demonstration,General.

(e)-(1)-(i)The eligibility demonstration must include the following information, at a minimum:

(A) Identification of each hazardous waste combustor combustion gas emission point (e.g., generally, the flue gas stack);

(B) The maximum and average capacity at which each combustor will operate, and the maximum rated capacity for each combustor, using the metric of stack gas volume (under both actual and standard conditions) emitted per unit of time, as well as any other metric that is appropriate for the combustor (e.g., million Btu/hr heat input for boilers; tons of dry raw material feed/hour for cement kilns);

(C) Stack parameters for each combustor, including, but not limited to stack height, stack diameter, stack gas temperature, and stack gas exit velocity;

(D) Plot plan showing all stack emission points, nearby residences and property boundary line;

(E) Identification of any stack gas control devices used to reduce emissions from each combustor;

(F) Identification of the RfC values used to calculate annual average HCl-equivalent emission rates and the aREL values used to calculate 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rates;

(G) Calculations used to determine the annual average and 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rates and rate limits, including calculation of the Cl/HCl ratios as prescribed by paragraph (b)(6) of this section;
