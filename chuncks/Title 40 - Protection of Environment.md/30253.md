####### § 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## General,Overview.

(a)-(1)You may establish and comply with health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine under the procedures prescribed in this section for your hazardous waste combustors other than hydrochloric acid production furnaces. You may comply with these health-based compliance alternatives in lieu of the emission standards for total chlorine provided under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. To identify and comply with the limits, you must:

(i) Identify a total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv) expressed as chloride (Cl(-)) equivalent for each on site hazardous waste combustor. You may select total chlorine emission concentrations as you choose to demonstrate eligibility for the risk-based limits under this section, except as provided by paragraph (b)(7) of this section;

(ii) Apportion the total chlorine emission concentration between HCl and Claccording to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, and calculate HCl and Clemission rates (lb/hr) using the gas flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.

(iii) Calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(iv) Perform an eligibility demonstration to determine if your HCl-equivalent emission rate meets the national exposure standard and thus is below the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, as prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section;

(v) Submit your eligibility demonstration for review and approval, as prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, which must include information to ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is not exceeded, as prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section;

(vi) Demonstrate compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit during the comprehensive performance test, as prescribed by the testing and monitoring requirements under paragraph (e) of this section;

(vii) Comply with compliance monitoring requirements, including establishing feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride, and operating parameter limits on emission control equipment, as prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section; and

(viii) Comply with the requirements for changes, as prescribed by paragraph (h) of this section.
