a. Visibility in important natural areas (Federal Class I areas) is protected under a number of provisions of the CAA, including sections 169A and 169B (addressing impacts primarily from existing sources) and section 165 (new source review). Visibility impairment is caused by light scattering and light absorption associated with particles and gases in the atmosphere. In most areas of the country, light scattering by PMis the most significant component of visibility impairment. The key components of PMcontributing to visibility impairment include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and crustal material.
