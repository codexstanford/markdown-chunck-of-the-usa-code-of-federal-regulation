(B) Starting in model year 2023,means a system that uses waste heat from the vehicle's exhaust to warm the transmission fluid to an operating temperature range using a dedicated heat exchanger.may also include coolant systems that capture heat from a liquid-cooled exhaust manifold if the coolant loop to the transmission heat exchanger is not shared with other heat-extracting systems and it starts heat transfer to the transmission fluid immediately after engine starting, consistent with designs that exchange heat directly from exhaust gases to the transmission fluid.
