####### Nonacute violations.

(ii)Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under § 141.132(c)(2). If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceed the MRDL and all distribution system samples taken are below the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL at the point of sampling and will notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for nonacute violations under § 141.32(e)(78) in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
