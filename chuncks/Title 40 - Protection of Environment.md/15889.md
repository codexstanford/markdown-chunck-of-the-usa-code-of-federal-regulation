######## Number concentration measurement.

(ii)A number counting particle sizer may be used in conjunction with the divided flow test apparatus in lieu of fluorometric measurement. This device must have a minimum range of 1 to 10 µm, a resolution of 0.1 µm, and an accuracy of 0.15 µm such that primary particles may be distinguished from multiplets for all test aerosols. The measurement of number concentration shall be accomplished by integrating the primary particle peak.
