###### General.

The applicant should estimate and report, in Schedule C.2, yearly sustaining capital outlays for maintenance of the smelter's existing productive capability. These estimates should be forecast under the assumption that full compliance with SIP emission limitations for SOwill be achieved. Major elements of these outlays should be disclosed, as well as the total of such outlays. Estimates shall be restricted to those items that will be capitalized for tax purposes. These outlays shall primarily be for plant replacement, although outlays for improvements and expansion may be included to the extent that improvements and/or expansion, exclusive of required pollution control outlays, can be justified as economically feasible. Estimates of sustaining capital shall exclude any incremental investment for constant control requirements. Sustaining capital investments in facilities shared with other operating segments shall be allocated in accordance with the instructions given below.

Estimates of sustaining capital shall be compatible with productive capacity and pollution control requirements underlying the operating revenue and cost forecasts incorporated in Schedule C.1.
