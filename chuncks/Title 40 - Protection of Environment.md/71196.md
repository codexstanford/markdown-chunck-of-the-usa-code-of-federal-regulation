####### ยง 310.22 What records must I keep?

(a) If you receive reimbursement under the regulations in this part, for three years you must keep all cost documentation and any other records related to your application. You must also provide EPA access to those records if we need them.

(b) After three years from the date of your reimbursement, if we have NOT begun a cost recovery action against a potentially responsible party, you may dispose of the records. You must notify EPA of your intent to dispose of the records 60 days before you do so, and allow us to take possession of these records beforehand.
