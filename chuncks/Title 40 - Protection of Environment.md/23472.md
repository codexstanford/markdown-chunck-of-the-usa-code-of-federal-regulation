####### Fuel gas system

means the offsite and onsite piping and control system that gathers gaseous streams generated by facility operations, may blend them with sources of gas, if available, and transports the blended gaseous fuel at suitable pressures for use as fuel in heaters, furnaces, boilers, incinerators, gas turbines, and other combustion devices located within or outside the facility. The fuel is piped directly to each individual combustion device, and the system typically operates at pressures over atmospheric.
