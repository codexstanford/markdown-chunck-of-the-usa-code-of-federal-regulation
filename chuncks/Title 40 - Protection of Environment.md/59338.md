####### What standards for residue removal do my nonrefillable containers have to meet?

(f)Each nonrefillable container and pesticide formulation combination must meet the applicable residue removal standard of this section.

(1) If the nonrefillable container is rigid and has a capacity less than or equal to 5 gallons (18.9 liters) for liquid formulations or 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) for solid formulations and if the pesticide product's labeling allows or requires the pesticide product to be mixed with a liquid diluent prior to application (that is, if the pesticide is dilutable), each container/formulation combination must be capable of attaining at least 99.99 percent removal of each active ingredient when tested using the EPA test procedure "Rinsing Procedures for Dilutable Pesticide Products in Rigid Containers."

(2) The test must be conducted only if the pesticide product is a suspension concentrate or if EPA specifically requests the records on a case by case basis.

(3) For the rigid container/dilutable product standard in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, percent removal represents the percent of the original concentration of the active ingredient in the pesticide product when compared to the concentration of that active ingredient in the fourth rinse. Percent removal is calculated by the formula:
