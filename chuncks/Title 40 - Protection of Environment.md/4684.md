####### Lower concentration limit.

3.1The lower detection limit of the mass concentration measurement range is estimated to be approximately 3 Âµg/m, based on the observed precision of PMmeasurements in the national PMmonitoring network, the probable similar level of precision for the matched PMmeasurements, and the additional variability arising from the differential nature of the measurement process. This value is provided merely as a guide to the significance of low PMconcentration measurements.
