## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 22 - CONSOLIDATED RULES OF PRACTICE GOVERNING THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES AND THE REVOCATION/TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF PERMITS
##### Subpart E - Initial Decision, Motion To Reopen a Hearing, and Motion To Set Aside a Default Order
###### ยง 22.28 Motion to reopen a hearing or to set aside a default order.
####### Effect of motion to set aside default.

(2)The timely filing of a motion to set aside a default order automatically tolls the running of the time periods for an initial decision becoming final under ยง 22.27(c), for appeal under ยง 22.30(a), and for the Environmental Appeals Board to elect to review the initial decision on its own initiative pursuant to ยง 22.30(b). These time periods begin again in full when the Presiding Officer serves an order denying the motion to set aside or an amended decision. The Presiding Officer may summarily deny subsequent motions to set aside a default order filed by the same party if the Presiding Officer determines that the motion was filed to delay the finality of the decision.
