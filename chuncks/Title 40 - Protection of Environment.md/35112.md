####### ยง 63.4371 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Dyeing operation

means the collection of equipment used to dye a textile substrate and includes equipment used for dye application, dye fixation, and textile substrate rinsing and drying. A single dyeing operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a dyeing material is applied and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP emissions from that dyeing material occur. There may be multiple dyeing operations in an affected source. Dyeing material application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, brushes, or marking pens is not a dyeing operation for the purposes of this subpart.
