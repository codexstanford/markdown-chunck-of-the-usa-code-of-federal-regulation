###### 6.1 What do I need for the measurement system?

The components of the measurement system are described (as applicable) in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Method 7E, except that the analyzer described in section 6.2 of this method must be used instead of the analyzer described in Method 7E. You must follow the noted specifications in section 6.1 of Method 7E except that the requirements to use stainless steel, Teflon, or non-reactive glass filters do not apply. Also, a heated sample line is not required to transport dry gases or for systems that measure the Oor COconcentration on a dry basis, provided that the system is not also being used to concurrently measure SOand/or NO.
