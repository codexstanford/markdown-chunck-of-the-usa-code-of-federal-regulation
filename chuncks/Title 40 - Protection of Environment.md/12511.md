(i)(A) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides 81 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency, or

(B) The system used to control VOM from the coating line is demonstrated to have an overall efficiency sufficient to limit VOM emissions to no more than what is allowed under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Use of any control system other than an afterburner, carbon absorption, condensation, or absorption scrubber system can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Transfer efficiency credits can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Baseline transfer efficiencies and transfer efficiency test methods must be approved by the Administrator.

Such overall efficiency is to be determined as follows:
