######## Pathway 2.

(2)To earn credits under this pathway, manufacturers shall calculate an average carbon-related exhaust emission value to the nearest one gram per mile for the classes of motor vehicles identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the results of such calculations will be reported to the Administrator for use in determining compliance with the applicable COearly credit threshold values.

(i) Credits under this pathway shall be calculated according to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except credits may only be generated by vehicles sold in a model year in California and in states with a section 177 program in effect in that model year. For the purposes of this section, "section 177 program" means State regulations or other laws that apply to vehicle emissions from any of the following categories of motor vehicles: Passenger automobiles, light-duty trucks up through 6,000 pounds GVWR, and medium-duty vehicles from 6,001 to 14,000 pounds GVWR, as these categories of motor vehicles are defined in the California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Division 3, Chapter 1, Article 1, Section 1900.

(ii) A deficit in any averaging set for any of the 2009-2011 model years must be offset using credits accumulated by any averaging set in any of the 2009-2011 model years before determining the number of credits that may be carried forward to the 2012 model year. Deficit carry forward and credit banking provisions of ยง 86.1865-12 apply to early credits earned under this paragraph (a)(1), except that deficits may not be carried forward from any of the 2009-2011 model years into the 2012 model year, and credits earned in the 2009 model year may not be traded to other manufacturers.
