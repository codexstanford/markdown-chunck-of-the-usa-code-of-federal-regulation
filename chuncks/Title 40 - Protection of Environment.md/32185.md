####### Exceptions to performance test requirements in the General Provisions.

(ii)(A) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions achievable during either the 6-month period ending 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1417(e) is due, or during the 6-month period surrounding the date of the performance test (i.e., the period beginning 3 months prior to the performance test and ending 3 months after the performance test). In achieving maximum representative operating conditions, an owner or operator is not required to cause damage to equipment, make a product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer, or make a product in excess of demand.

(B) When § 63.7(g) references the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.9(h), the requirements in § 63.1417(e) shall apply for purposes of this subpart.

(C) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), rather than according to the time periods in § 63.7(a)(2).
