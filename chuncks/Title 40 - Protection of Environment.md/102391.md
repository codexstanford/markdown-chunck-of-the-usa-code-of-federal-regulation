###### ยง 1060.520 How do I test fuel tanks for permeation emissions?
####### Pressure cycling.

(1)Perform a pressure test by sealing the fuel tank and cycling it between +13.8 and -3.4 kPa (+2.0 and -0.5 psig) for 10,000 cycles at a rate of 60 seconds per cycle. The purpose of this test is to represent environmental wall stresses caused by pressure changes and other factors (such as vibration or thermal expansion). If your fuel tank cannot be tested using the pressure cycles specified by this paragraph (a)(1), you may ask to use special test procedures under ยง 1060.505.
