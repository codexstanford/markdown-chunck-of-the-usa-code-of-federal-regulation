###### ยง 1054.115 What other requirements apply?
####### Adjustable parameters.

(b)Engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the practically adjustable range. We may require that you set adjustable parameters to any specification within the practically adjustable range during any testing, including certification testing, production-line testing, or in-use testing. You may ask us to limit idle-speed or carburetor adjustments to a smaller range than the practically adjustable range if you show us that the engine will not be adjusted outside of this smaller range during in-use operation without significantly degrading engine performance. General provisions for adjustable parameters apply as specified in 40 CFR 1068.50.
