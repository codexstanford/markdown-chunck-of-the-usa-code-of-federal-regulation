####### ยง 1065.1133 Application selection, data gathering, and analysis.
######## Field data target selection.

(a)Use good engineering judgment to select one or more target applications for gathering of input field data for the accelerated aging cycle generation that represent a greater than average exposure to potential field aging factors. It should be noted that the same application may not necessarily represent the worst case for all aging factors. If sufficient data is not available to make this determination with multiple applications, you may select the application that is expected to have the highest sales volume for a given engine family.
