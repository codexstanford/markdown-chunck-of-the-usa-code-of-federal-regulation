(2) We may perform coastdown testing to verify your tractor drag area for any certified configuration. If you use an alternate method for determining aerodynamic drag area for tractors, we may perform testing to verifyas specified in subpart F of this part.

(3) We may test trailers (and devices receiving preliminary approval) using the wind-tunnel method described in ยง 1037.530. We may also test using an alternate method; however, we will determine how to appropriately correct or correlate those results to testing with the wind-tunnel method.

(h) You may ask us to use analytically derived GEM inputs for untested configurations (such as untested axle ratios within an axle family) as identified in subpart F of this part based on interpolation of all relevant measured values for related configurations, consistent with good engineering judgment. We may establish specific approval criteria based on prevailing industry practice. If we allow this, we may test any configuration. We may also require you to test any configuration as part of a selective enforcement audit.
