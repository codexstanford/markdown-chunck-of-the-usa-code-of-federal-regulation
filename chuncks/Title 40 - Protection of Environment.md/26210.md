####### Ongoing compliance status reports for major sources.

(g)(1) The owner or operator of an affected source that is located at a major source site shall submit a summary report to the Administrator to document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source. The report shall contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, and shall be submitted semiannually except when:

(i) The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source; or

(ii) The monitoring data collected by the owner or operator of the affected source in accordance with ยง 63.343(c) show that the emission limit has been exceeded, in which case quarterly reports shall be submitted. Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an exceedance, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is approved.
