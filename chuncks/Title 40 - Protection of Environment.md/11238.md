####### Determination of Attainment:

(d)Effective October 10, 2013, EPA has determined that, based on 2010 to 2012 ambient air quality data, the Chico PMnonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2006 24-hour PMNAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.

(e) By August 14, 2017, California must adopt and submit a Serious Area plan to provide for attainment of the 2006 PMNAAQS in the South Coast PMnonattainment area. The Serious Area plan must include emissions inventories, an attainment demonstration, best available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, quantitative milestones, contingency measures, and such other measures as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of the 2006 PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date, in accordance with the requirements of subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act.

(f) [Reserved]
