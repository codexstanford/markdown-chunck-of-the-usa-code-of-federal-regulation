####### ยง 53.62 Test procedure: Full wind tunnel test.
######## Alternative measure of wind tunnel total concentration.

(6)If a single isokinetic sampler is used to determine the mean aerosol concentration in the wind tunnel, install the sampler in the wind tunnel with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone (paragraph (c)(6) of this section).

(i) Collect particles on an appropriate filter over a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.

(ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the isokinetic sampler using a calibrated fluorometer.

(iii) Calculate and record the mass concentration as Cas in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.

(iv) Remove the isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.
