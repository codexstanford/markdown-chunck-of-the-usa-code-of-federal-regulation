6.3.1(). First, calculate the mean reference value (Equation E-1) of the 14 average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method. Second, from the 14 pairs of average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method and measurement system volumetric flow rate readings, calculate the mean value (Equation E-1) of the differences of the 14 paired readings. Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval (Equation E-2) using the differences of fourteen paired readings. To calculate the values in the second part of this section substituteforandforin Equations E-1 and E-2 whereequals the difference of each paired reading andequals the mean value of the fourteen paired differences. Third, report the sum of the absolute mean value of the differences of the fourteen paired readings and the 95 percent confidence interval of the differences of value calculated in the first part of the section. Divide this total by the mean reference value and report the result as a percentage. This percentage is the relative accuracy.
