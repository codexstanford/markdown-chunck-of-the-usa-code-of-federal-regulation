####### Compliance schedule.

(a)The owner or operator shall monitor all connectors in each process unit initially for leaks by the later of either 12 months after the compliance date as specified in a referencing subpart or 12 months after initial startup. If all connectors in each process unit have been monitored for leaks prior to the compliance date specified in the referencing subpart, no initial monitoring is required provided either no process changes have been made since the monitoring or the owner or operator can determine that the results of the monitoring, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. If required to monitor because of a process change, the owner or operator is required to monitor only those connectors involved in the process change.
