####### Pesticide compatible as applied to containers

means that the container construction materials will not chemically react with the formulation. A container is not compatible with the formulation if, for example, the formulation:

(1) Is corrosive to the container;

(2) Causes softening, premature aging, or embrittlement of the container;

(3) Otherwise causes the container to weaken or to create the risk of discharge;

(4) Reacts in a significant chemical, electrolytic, or galvanic manner with the container, or

(5) Interacts in a way, such as the active ingredient permeating the container wall, that would cause the formulation to differ from its composition as described in the statement required in connection with its registration under FIFRA section 3.
