###### ยง 1051.515 How do I test my fuel tank for permeation emissions?
####### Preconditioning fuel soak.

(a)To precondition your fuel tank, follow these five steps:

(1) Fill the tank with the fuel specified in ยง 1051.501(d)(2)(i), seal it, and allow it to soak at 28 +/-5 &#xB0;C for 20 weeks or at (43 +/-5) &#xB0;C for 10 weeks.

(2) Determine the fuel tank's internal surface area in square-meters accurate to at least three significant figures. You may use less accurate estimates of the surface area if you make sure not to overestimate the surface area.

(3) Fill the fuel tank with the test fuel specified in ยง 1051.501(d)(2)(ii) to its nominal capacity. If you fill the tank inside the temperature-controlled room or enclosure, do not spill any fuel.

(4) Allow the tank and its contents to equilibrate to 28 +/-2 &#xB0;C.

(5) Seal the fuel tank using fuel caps and other fittings (excluding petcocks) that can be used to seal openings in a production fuel tank. In cases where openings are not normally sealed on the fuel tank (such as hose-connection fittings and vents in fuel caps), these openings may be sealed using nonpermeable fittings such as metal or fluoropolymer plugs.
