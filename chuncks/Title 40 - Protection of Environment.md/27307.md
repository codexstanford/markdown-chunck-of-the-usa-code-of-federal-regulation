####### Process unit shutdown

means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit or part of a process unit consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be accomplished. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not considered a process unit shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit or part of the process unit of materials and start up the unit, or would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown is not considered a process unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not considered process unit shutdowns.
