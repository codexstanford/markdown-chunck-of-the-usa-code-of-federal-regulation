####### e.g.,

(4) The provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section apply to suppliers subject to subparts LL through QQ of this part by substituting the term "quantity of GHG supplied" for "emissions." For suppliers, the provisions of paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) apply individually to each importer and exporter and individually to each petroleum refinery, fractionator of natural gas liquids, local natural gas distribution company, and producer of CO, NO, or fluorinated greenhouse gases (a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases might qualify to discontinue reporting as an exporter of industrial greenhouse gases but still be required to report as an importer; or a company might qualify to discontinue reporting as a supplier of industrial greenhouse gases under subpart OO of this part but still be required to report as a supplier of carbon dioxide under subpart PP of this part).

(5) If the operations of a facility or supplier are changed such that a process or operation no longer meets the "Definition of Source Category" as specified in an applicable subpart, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with any such subpart for the reporting years following the year in which change occurs, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the cessation of reporting for the process or operation no later than March 31 following the first reporting year in which such changes persist for an entire reporting year. The owner or operator must resume complying with this part for the process or operation starting in any future calendar year during which the process or operation meets the "Definition of Source Category" as specified in an applicable subpart.

(6) If an entire facility or supplier is merged into another facility or supplier that is already reporting GHG data under this part, then the owner or operator may discontinue complying with this part for the facility or supplier, provided that the owner or operator submits a notification to the Administrator that announces the discontinuation of reporting and the e-GGRT identification number of the reconstituted facility no later than March 31 of the year following such changes.

(j) Table A-2 of this subpart provides a conversion table for some of the common units of measure used in part 98.
