####### Volatile organic compound (VOC)

means any compound defined as VOC in 40 CFR 51.100. This includes any organic compound other than those determined by the EPA to be an exempt solvent. For purposes of determining compliance with emission limits, VOC will be measured by the approved test methods. Where such a method also inadvertently measures compounds that are exempt solvent, an owner or operator may exclude these exempt solvents when determining compliance with an emission standard.
