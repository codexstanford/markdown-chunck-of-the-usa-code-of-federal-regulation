####### ยง 1065.1145 Execution of accelerated aging, cycle tracking, and cycle validation criteria.
######## Secondary oil consumption validation.

(ii)If your aftertreatment includes a diesel particulate filter, we recommend that you perform secondary validation of oil consumption by using clean (soot free) DPF weights to track ash loading and compare this mass of ash to the amount predicted using the measured oil consumption mass and the oil ash concentration. The mass of ash found by DPF weight should fall within a range of (55 to 70)% of the of mass predicted from oil consumption measurements. Perform this validation at the end of aging, at any intermediate emission test points, and at any point where you need to clean the DPF of accumulated ash in according with recommended maintenance.
