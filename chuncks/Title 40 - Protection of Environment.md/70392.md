###### Net precipitation.

3.1.2.2Assign a net precipitation factor value to the site. Figure 3-2 provides computed net precipitation factor values, based on site location. Where necessary, determine the net precipitation factor value as follows:

- Determine monthly precipitation and monthly evapotranspiration:

Select the latitude adjusting value for each month from table 3-3. For latitudes lower than 50&#xB0; North or 20&#xB0; South, determine the monthly latitude adjusting value by interpolation.

- Calculate monthly net precipitation by subtracting monthly evapotranspiration (or monthly potential evapotranspiration) from monthly precipitation. If evapotranspiration (or potential evapotranspiration) exceeds precipitation for a month, assign that month a net precipitation value of 0.

- Calculate the annual net precipitation by summing the monthly net precipitation values.

- Based on the annual net precipitation, assign a net precipitation factor value from table 3-4.

Enter the value assigned from Figure 3-2 or from table 3-4, as appropriate, in table 3-1.
