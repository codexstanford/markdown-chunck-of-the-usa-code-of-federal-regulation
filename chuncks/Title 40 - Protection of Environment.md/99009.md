####### Inhalation.

(2)A single (or more if needed) concentration of test substance must be used in this portion of the study. The concentration should be selected in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Inhalation treatments are to be conducted using a "nose-cone" or "head-only" apparatus to prevent absorption by alternate routes of exposure. If other inhalation exposure conditions are proposed for use in a chemical-specific test rule, justification for the modification must be documented. A single exposure over a defined period must be used for each group-a typical exposure is 4-6 hours.
