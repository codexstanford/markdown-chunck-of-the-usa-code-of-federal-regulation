######## Waste heat recovery

(vii)means a system that captures heat that would otherwise be lost through the engine, exhaust system, or the radiator or other sources and converting that heat to electrical energy that is used to meet the electrical requirements of the vehicle or used to augment the warming of other load reduction technologies (e.g., cabin warming, active engine or transmission warm-up technologies). The amount of energy recovered is the average value over 5-cycle testing.
