###### Prohibition of bypass.

(d)(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take enforcement action against an Industrial User for a bypass, unless;

(i) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(ii) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and

(iii) The Industrial User submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
