The OSC is the federal official predesignated by EPA or the USCG to coordinate and direct federal responses under subpart D of the NCP. The USCG shall provide OSCs for oil discharges, including discharges from facilities and vessels under the jurisdiction of another federal agency, within or threatening the coastal zone. EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges into or threatening the inland zone. In carrying out a response, the OSC may direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge. In contingency planning and removal, the OSC coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, Area Committees, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, decision document, consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response.
