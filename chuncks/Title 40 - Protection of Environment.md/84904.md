() As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 2.4 mg/mas an 8-hour time-weighted-average for this substance (PMN P-06-37; CAS No. 389623-07-8) and the substance referred to in 40 CFR 721.10230 (PMN P-06-36; CAS No. 389623-01-2) combined. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the ยง 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under ยง 721.30. Persons whose ยง 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.
