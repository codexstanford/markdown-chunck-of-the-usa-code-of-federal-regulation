####### Definitions and units.

(2)(i) "Desorption efficiency" of a particular compound applied to a sorbent and subsequently extracted with a solvent is the weight of the compound which can be recovered from the sorbent divided by the weight of the compound originally sorbed.

(ii) "Pascal" (Pa) is the standard international unit of vapor pressure and is defined as newtons per square meter (N/m). A newton is the force necessary to give acceleration of one meter per second squared to one kilogram of mass.

(iii) The "torr" is a unit of pressure which equals 133.3 pascals or 1 mm Hg at 0 &#xB0;C.

(iv) "Vapor pressure" is the pressure at which a liquid or solid is in equilibrium with its vapor at a given temperature.

(v) "Volatilization" is the loss of a substance to the air from a surface or from solution by evaporation.
