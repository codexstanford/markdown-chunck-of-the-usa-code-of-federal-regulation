####### Enumeration of splenic or peripheral blood total B cells, total T cells, and T cell subpopulations.

(2)The phenotypic analysis of total B cell, total T cell, and T cell subpopulations from the spleen or peripheral blood by flow cytometry should be performed after at least 28 days of dosing; this may be performed at a later timepoint, if ADME data suggest that a longer exposure is more appropriate. If an exposure period longer than 28 days is used, then these tests may be performed in conjunction with subchronic (ninety day oral, dermal, or inhalation) toxicity studies, when these studies are required. Methods described in the references under paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(5) of this section may be used.
