######## Decorative tin

means a single-walled container, designed to be covered or uncovered that is manufactured from metal substrate equal to or thinner than 0.3785 mm (0.0149 inch) and is normally coated on the exterior surface with decorative coatings. Decorative tins may contain foods but are not hermetically sealed and are not subject to food processing steps such as retort or pasteurization. Interior coatings are not usually applied to protect the metal and contents from chemical interaction.
