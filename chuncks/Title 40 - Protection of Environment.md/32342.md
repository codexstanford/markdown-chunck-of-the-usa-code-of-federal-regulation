####### Monitoring requirements.

(ii)The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (e)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) of this section if applicable.

(A) The owner or operator shall establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with ยง 63.1438(a) based on emission point and control technique characteristics when polyether polyol is being produced.

(B) The owner or operator shall monitor each parameter at each device subject to monitoring requirements at all times (during periods when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, and during periods when the PMPU produces products other than polyether polyols), with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.

(C) If ECO is used to reduce epoxide emissions, a parameter monitoring level shall be established for the production of non-polyether polyol products as the average of the established parameter levels for all product classes produced. During periods when products other than polyether polyols are produced, the ECO shall be performed so that the parameter monitoring level established for the production of non-polyether polyol products is maintained when the ECO is used as a control technique.
