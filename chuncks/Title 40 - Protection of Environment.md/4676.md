####### Test design values (TDV)

are numerical values that used in the data substitution tests described in sections 4.1(c)(i), 4.1(c)(ii) and 4.2(c)(i) of this appendix to determine if the PMNAAQS DV with incomplete data are judged to be valid for NAAQS comparisons. There are two TDVs: TDVto determine if the NAAQS is not met and is used in the "minimum quarterly value" data substitution test and TDVto determine if the NAAQS is met and is used in the "maximum quarterly value" data substitution test. These TDV's are derived by substituting historically low or historically high daily concentration values for missing data in an incomplete year(s).
