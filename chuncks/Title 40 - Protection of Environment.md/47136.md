####### CFV calibration.

(c)(1) Calibration of the Critical Flow Venturi (CFV) is based upon the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of inlet pressure and temperature:

(i) Q= Flow.

(ii) K= Calibration coefficient.

(iii) P = Absolute pressure.

(iv) T = Absolute temperature.

The calibration procedure described below establishes the value of the calibration coefficient at the measured values of pressure, temperature and air flow.

(2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.

(3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

(4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure F78-6 and check for leaks. Any leaks between the flow measuring device and the critical flow venturi will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.

(5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the blower and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all instruments.

(6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least 8 readings across the critical flow range of the venturi.
