(3)Except for pressure relief devices needed for safety purposes, low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, and open-ended valves or lines, the owner or operator shall comply with either of the following provisions for each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream to the atmosphere:

(i) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in ยง 65.163(a)(1)(i). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line.

(ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be generated as specified in ยง 65.163(a)(1)(ii).
