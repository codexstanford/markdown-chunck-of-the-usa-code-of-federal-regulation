(a)-(c) [Reserved]

(d) Section 227.3(a)(2) of 6 NYCRR, as submitted on August 10, 1979, is disapproved because it is inconsistent with 40 CFR Subpart G, Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

(e) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of December 15, 2010, that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT fine particle (PM) nonattainment area has attained the 1997 PMNational Ambient Air Quality Standard. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably control available measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 PMNAAQS.
