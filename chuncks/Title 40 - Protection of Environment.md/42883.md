######## i.e.

(xi) If, at the end of the second quarter of any calendar year, a required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test of a monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s) to be completed in a subsequent quarter, the owner or operator shall indicate this by means of a suitable conditionally valid data flag in the electronic quarterly report for the second calendar quarter. The owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter if the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is subsequently failed. In the resubmitted report, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data that was invalidated by the failed quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test. Alternatively, if any required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is not completed by the end of the second calendar quarter but is completed no later than 30 days after the end of that quarter (, prior to the deadline for submitting the quarterly report under § 75.73), the test data and results may be submitted with the second quarter report even though the test date(s) are from the third calendar quarter. In such instances, if the quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test(s) are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions of § 75.20(b)(3), conditionally valid data may be reported as quality-assured, in lieu of reporting a conditional data flag. If the tests are failed and if conditionally valid data are replaced, as appropriate, with substitute data, then neither the reporting of a conditional data flag nor resubmission is required.

(xii) If, at the end of the third quarter of any calendar year, a required quality assurance, diagnostic or recertification test of a monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s) to be completed, the owner or operator shall do one of the following:

(A) If the results of the required tests are not available within 30 days of the end of the third calendar quarter and cannot be submitted with the quarterly report for the third calendar quarter, then the test results are considered to be missing and the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data in the third quarter report. In addition, if the data in the second quarterly report were flagged as conditionally valid at the end of the quarter, pending the results of the same missing tests, the owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter and shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the missing quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification tests; or

(B) If the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification tests are completed no later than 30 days after the end of the third calendar quarter, the test data and results may be submitted with the third quarter report even though the test date(s) are from the fourth calendar quarter. In this instance, if the required tests are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions of § 75.20(b)(3), all conditionally valid data associated with the tests shall be reported as quality-assured. If the tests are failed, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the failed test(s). In addition, if the data in the second quarterly report were flagged as conditionally valid at the end of the quarter, pending the results of the same failed test(s), the owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter and shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the failed test(s).

(4) The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix D of this part to determine heat input rate is required to maintain fuel flowmeters only during the ozone season, except that for purposes of determining the deadline for the next periodic quality assurance test on the fuel flowmeter, the owner or operator shall include all fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters (as defined in § 72.2) for the entire calendar year, not just fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters in the ozone season. For each calendar year, the owner or operator shall record, for each fuel flowmeter, the number of fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters. The owner or operator shall include all calendar quarters in the year when determining the deadline for visual inspection of the primary fuel flowmeter element, as specified in section 2.1.6(c) of appendix D to this part.

(5) The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix D of this part to determine heat input rate is only required to sample fuel for the purposes of determining density and GCV during the ozone season, except that:

(i) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling from the fuel storage tank upon delivery must sample the tank between the date and hour of the most recent delivery before the first date and hour that the unit operates in the ozone season and the first date and hour that the unit operates in the ozone season.

(ii) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling upon delivery from the delivery vehicle must ensure that all shipments received during the calendar year are sampled.

(iii) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling on each day the unit combusts fuel or that performs fuel sampling continuously must sample the fuel starting on the first day the unit operates during the ozone season. The owner or operator then shall use that sampled value for all hours of combustion during the first day of unit operation, continuing until the date and hour of the next sample.

(6) The owner or operator shall, in accordance with § 75.73, record and report the hourly data required by this subpart and shall record and report the results of all required quality assurance tests, as follows:

(i) All hourly emission data for the period of time from May 1 through September 30 of each calendar year shall be recorded and reported. For missing data purposes, only the data recorded in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be considered quality-assured;

(ii) The results of all daily calibration error tests and flow monitor interference checks performed in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be recorded and reported;

(iii) For the time periods described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, hourly emission data and the results of all daily calibration error tests and flow monitor interference checks shall be recorded. The owner or operator may opt to report unit operating data, daily calibration error test and flow monitor interference check results, and hourly emission data in the time period from April 1 through April 30. However, only the data recorded in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be used for NOmass compliance determination;

(iv) The results of all required quality assurance tests (RATAs, linearity checks, flow-to-load ratio tests and leak checks) performed during the ozone season shall be reported in the appropriate ozone season quarterly report; and
