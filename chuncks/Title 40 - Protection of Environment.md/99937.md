####### Hybrid engine

means a hybrid system with features for storing and recovering energy that are integral to the engine or are otherwise upstream of the vehicle's transmission other than a conventional battery system or conventional flywheel. Supplemental electrical batteries and hydraulic accumulators are examples of hybrid energy storage systems. Examples of hybrids that could be considered hybrid engines are P0, P1, and P2 hybrids where hybrid features are connected to the front end of the engine, at the crankshaft, or connected between the clutch and the transmission where the clutch upstream of the hybrid feature is in addition to the transmission clutch(s), respectively. Note other examples of systems that qualify as hybrid engines are systems that recover kinetic energy and use it to power an electric heater in the aftertreatment.
