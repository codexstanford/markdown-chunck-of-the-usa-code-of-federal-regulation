####### Engines used in glider vehicles.

(o)For purposes of recertifying a used engine for installation in a glider vehicle, we may allow you to include in an existing certified engine family those engines you modify (or otherwise demonstrate) to be identical to engines already covered by the certificate. We would base such an approval on our review of any appropriate documentation. These engines must have emission control information labels that accurately describe their status.
