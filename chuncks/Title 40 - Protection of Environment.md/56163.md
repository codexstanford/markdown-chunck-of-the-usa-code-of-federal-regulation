####### Disinfection byproducts.

(b)(1) Systems must measure disinfection byproducts by the methods (as modified by the footnotes) listed in the following table or one of the alternative methods listed in appendix A to subpart C of this part:

(2) Analyses under this section for disinfection byproducts must be conducted by laboratories that have received certification by EPA or the State, except as specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

The acceptance limit is defined as the 95% confidence interval calculated around the mean of the PE study between a maximum and minimum acceptance limit of +/-50% and +/-15% of the study mean.

(iii) Beginning April 1, 2007, the laboratory must achieve quantitative results on the PE sample analyses that are within the following acceptance limits:

(iv) Beginning April 1, 2007, report quantitative data for concentrations at least as low as the ones listed in the following table for all DBP samples analyzed for compliance with §§ 141.64, 141.135, and subparts U and V of this part:

(3) A party approved by EPA or the State must measure daily chlorite samples at the entrance to the distribution system.
