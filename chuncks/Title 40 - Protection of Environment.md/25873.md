() Procedures for calculating the percent reduction for pollution prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(C) If the vessel is controlled according to the provisions of ยง 63.119(e)(2) of this section whereby the control device is only required to achieve at least 90-percent reduction, the vessel shall not be considered to be generating debits.

(iii) The following equation shall be used for each internal floating roof vessel i that does not meet the specifications of ยง 63.119(b) or (d) of this subpart to calculate ES:

(A) Withdrawal loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(B) Rim seal loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(C) Fitting loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(D) Deck seam loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(iv) The following equation shall be used for each external floating roof vessel i that does not meet the specifications of ยง 63.119(c) of this subpart to calculate ES:

(A) Withdrawal loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(B) Rim seal loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(C) Fitting loss emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:

(4) Emissions from transfer racks shall be calculated as follows:

(i) The following equation shall be used for each transfer rack i to calculate ETR:

(ii) The following equation shall be used for each transfer rack i to calculate the weighted average rack partial pressure:

(iii) The following equation shall be used for each transfer rack i to calculate the weighted average rack molecular weight:

(iv) The following equation shall be used for each transfer rack i to calculate the monthly weighted rack bulk liquid loading temperature:

(v) The following procedures and equations shall be used to calculate ETR:

(A) If the transfer rack is not controlled, ETR= ETR, where ETRis calculated using the equations specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (g)(4)(iv) of this section.

(B) If the transfer rack is controlled using a control device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than the 98-percent reduction,
