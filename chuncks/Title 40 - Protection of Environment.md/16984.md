###### ยง 59.208 Charcoal lighter material testing protocol.
####### Meteorological and environmental criteria.

(d)(1) Testing shall be conducted under the following conditions:

(i) Inlet combustion air temperature is 16 to 27 degrees Celsius (60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit) with a relative humidity of 20 to 80 percent;

(ii) The charcoal and lighter material are stored 72 hours before testing in a location with a relative humidity between 45 and 65 percent, and a temperature between 18 and 24 degrees Celsuis (65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit); and

(iii) The outside wind speed, including gusts, may be no more than 16 kilometers per hour (10 miles per hour) if the test stack is exhausted outdoors, or, if the test stack is exhausted indoors, indoor air must be stagnant.

(2) Temperature and relative humidity of the combustion air shall be continuously monitored during the test. Temperature and relative humidity of the place where the charcoal and lighter material are stored prior to the test shall be monitored and recorded during the 72 hours immediately prior to the test. If the stack is exhausted outdoors, the continuous outdoor wind speed monitor shall be observed or recorded continuously during testing. If the wind speed monitor is manually observed rather than electronically recorded, the maximum wind speed observed during the test shall be recorded.
