####### Requirements for States to adopt 40 CFR part 141, subpart H Filtration and Disinfection.

(b)In addition to the general primacy requirements enumerated elsewhere in this part, including the requirement that State provisions are no less stringent than the federal requirements, an application for approval of a State program revision that adopts 40 CFR part 141, subpart H Filtration and Disinfection, must contain the information specified in this paragraph (b), except that States which require without exception all public water systems using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water to provide filtration need not demonstrate that the State program has provisions that apply to systems which do not provide filtration treatment. However, such States must provide the text of the State statutes or regulations which specifies that all public water systems using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water must provide filtration.
