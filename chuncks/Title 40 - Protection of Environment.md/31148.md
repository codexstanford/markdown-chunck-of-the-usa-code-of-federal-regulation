###### § 63.1310 Applicability and designation of affected sources.
####### Adding emission points or making process changes to existing affected sources.

(2)The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.

(i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever is later, as provided in § 63.6(b), except that new affected sources whose primary product is poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) shall be in compliance with § 63.1331 upon initial start-up or by February 27, 2001, whichever is later.

(A) The replacement of components meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.1312(b); and

(B) Such reconstruction commenced after March 29, 1995.

(ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met, and that replacement of components creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components subject to § 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to §§ 63.1316 through 63.1320, and heat exchange systems subject to § 63.1328), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission points shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.1331, and June 19, 2001 for most emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.

(iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected source that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components subject to § 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to §§ 63.1316 through 63.1320, and heat exchange systems subject to § 63.1328), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.1331, and June 19, 2001 for most emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.

(iv) If any process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected source that results in baseline emissions (i.e., emissions prior to applying controls for purposes of complying with this subpart) from continuous process vents in the collection of material recovery sections within the affected source at an existing affected source producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process changing from less than or equal to 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product to greater than 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product, the continuous process vents shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.
