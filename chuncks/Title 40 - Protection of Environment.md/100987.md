####### Initial and final test results.

(1)Calculate and round the test results for each engine. If you do multiple tests on an engine in a given configuration (without modifying the engine), calculate the initial results for each test, then add all the test results together and divide by the number of tests. Round this final calculated value for the final test results on that engine. Include the Green Engine Factor to determine low-hour emission results, if applicable.
