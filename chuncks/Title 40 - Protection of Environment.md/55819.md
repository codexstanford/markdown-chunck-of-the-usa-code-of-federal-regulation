###### ยง 141.40 Monitoring requirements for unregulated contaminants.
####### General applicability.

(a)This section specifies the monitoring and quality control requirements that must be followed if you own or operate a public water system (PWS) that is subject to the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR), as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. In addition, this section specifies the UCMR requirements for State and Tribal participation. For the purposes of this section, PWS "population served," "State," " PWS Official," "PWS Technical Contact," and "finished water" apply as defined in ยง 141.35(a). The determination of whether a PWS is required to monitor under this rule is based on the type of system (e.g., community water system, non-transient non-community water system, etc.), and its retail population, as indicated by SDWIS/Fed on February 1, 2021 or subsequent corrections from the State.
