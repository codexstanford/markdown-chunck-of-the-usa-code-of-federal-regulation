####### ab initio.

(3) In any case in which a manufacturer knowingly submits false or inaccurate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void

(4) In any case in which certification of a vehicle (or engine) is proposed to be withheld, denied, revoked, or suspended under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section, and in which the Administrator has presented to the manufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of ยง 86.091-7(d) in fact occurred, the manufacturer, if he wishes to contend that, even though the violation occurred, the vehicle (or engine) in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant withholding, denial, revocation, or suspension of certification under either paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.

(5) Any revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall:

(i) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with ยง 86.078-6 hereof; and

(ii) Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of vehicles (or engines) previously covered by the certification which are still in the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other misconduct as makes the certification invalid ab initio.

(6) The manufacturer may request in the form and manner specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section that any determination made by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to withhold or deny certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with ยง 86.078-6. If the Administrator finds, after a review of the request and supporting data, that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he will grant the request with respect to such issue.

(d) [Reserved]
