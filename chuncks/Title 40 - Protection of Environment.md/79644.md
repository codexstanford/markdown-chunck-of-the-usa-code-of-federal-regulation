####### Release to water.

(iii)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 100 ppb for P-88-1937 and N = 10 ppb for P-88-1938). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง 721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substances that will be released will be calculated before the substances enter control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substances will be treated before release, the amount of the PMN substances reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 50 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.
