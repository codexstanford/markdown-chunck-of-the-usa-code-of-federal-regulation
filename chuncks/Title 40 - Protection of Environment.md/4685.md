####### Upper concentration limit.

3.2The upper limit of the mass concentration range is determined principally by the PMfilter mass loading beyond which the sampler can no longer maintain the operating flow rate within specified limits due to increased pressure drop across the loaded filter. This upper limit cannot be specified precisely because it is a complex function of the ambient particle size distribution and type, humidity, the individual filter used, the capacity of the sampler flow rate control system, and perhaps other factors. All PMsamplers are estimated to be capable of measuring 24-hour mass concentrations of at least 200 Âµg/mwhile maintaining the operating flow rate within the specified limits. The upper limit for the PMmeasurement is likely to be somewhat lower because the PMconcentration represents only a fraction of the PMconcentration.
