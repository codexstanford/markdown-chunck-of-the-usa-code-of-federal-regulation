####### Study.

(c)The Commonwealth, according to the schedule set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, shall conduct a comprehensive study of, and in that study recommend, the establishment of permanent bikeways and related facilities within the area described in paragraph (b) of this section. The study shall consider or include at least the following elements:

(1) The physical design for bikeways, intersections involving bikeways, and means of bicycle link-ups with other modes of transportation;

(2) The location of bikeways, including ascertaining high accident or pollution areas and developing means of avoiding or ameliorating those situations as well as means of providing intersection safety generally;

(3) The location of bicycle parking facilities, including bus stops;

(4) The rules of the road for bicyclists, and to the extent that present rules must be modified because of bikeways, new rules of the road for motorists. Also the feasibility of mandatory adult bicycle registration to minimize theft and increase recovery of stolen bicycles;

(5) Bicycle safety education for bicyclists, motorists, children, students, street maintenance personnel and policemen, including requiring bicycle safety principles and safe street riding skills to be taught in high school automobile driver(s) education programs;

(6) Methods for publicizing bicycles or bicycles plus mass transit as alternatives to automobile transportation, including the preparation, perhaps in conjunction with bicentennial efforts, of a master Boston area transit map, indicating the kind, extent and location of bicycle facilities, public baths, showers, toilet facilities, water fountains, as well as routes and stops for MBTA, common carriers and private bus lines, such map to be distributed by the Registry of Motor Vehicles with each automobile new registration and automobile registration renewal;

(7) Requiring or providing incentives for common carriers and mass transit carriers, especially the Blue Line of the MBTA, to provide bicycle parking facilities at their respective terminals and stations and bicycle carrying facilities on their respective vehicles;

(8) The creation of roadway zones in which all vehicles, except mass transit, emergency and service vehicles, and bicycles, would be excluded;

(9) Requiring or providing incentives for office buildings and employers to install and to provide free shower and locker facilities for cyclists;

(10) A bicycle user and potential user survey, which shall at a minimum determine:

(i) For present bicycle riders, the origin, destination, frequency, travel time, distance and purpose of bicycle trips;

(ii) In high density employment areas, the present modes of transportation of employees and the potential modes of transportation, including the numbers of employees who would use a bicycle for a significant portion of their commuting transportation were suitable facilities available to them. This section of the study shall seek to ascertain the size of the working population that would move from automobiles to mass transit and bicycles or bicycles alone as a significant form of transportation. It shall also seek to ascertain what bicycle facilities or mix thereof would produce the greatest conversion from auto use;

(11) The special problems related to the design and incorporation in the bikeway facilities described in paragraph (f) of this section of feeder bikeways to bridges, on-bridge bikeways, feeder bikeways to MBTA and railroad stations, feeder bikeways to fringe parking areas, and bicycle passage through rotaries and squares;

(12) The conversion of railroad beds, power lines, flood control channels or similar corridors to bikepaths;

(13) Removing barriers to employees bringing their bicycles into their offices;

(14) Removal or alteration of drain grates with bars so placed as to catch bicycle wheels;

(15) Bicycle rentals at appropriate locations; and

(16) The feasibility of constructing bikeways along at least each of the corridors set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.

(d) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall submit to the Regional Administrator no later than October 1, 1975, a detailed compliance schedule showing the steps that will be taken to carry out the study required by paragraph (c) of this section. The compliance schedule shall at a minimum include:

(1) Designation of the agency responsible for conducting the study;

(2) A date for initiation of the study, which date shall be no later than October 1, 1975; and

(3) A date for completion of the study, and submittal thereof to the Administrator, which date shall be no later than June 30, 1976.

(e) On or before September 1, 1976, the Administrator shall publish in thehis response to the study required by paragraph (c) of this section, and shall, in that response, either approve the facility location and designs and other requirements as well as the proposed compliance schedule for permanent facilities recommended in the study, or shall designate alternative and/or additional facility locations and designs and other requirements as well as modify the proposed compliance schedule for permanent facilities. The Administrator may provide, if he deems it necessary, for a public comment period prior to the effective date of his response.
