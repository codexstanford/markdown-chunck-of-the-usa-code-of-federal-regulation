######## e.g.

(vii) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value or digital equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital equivalent signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.

(viii) When there is an alkali bypass and/or an inline coal mill with a separate stack associated with a kiln, the main exhaust and alkali bypass and/or inline coal mill must be tested simultaneously and the combined emission rate of PM from the kiln and alkali bypass and/or inline coal mill must be computed for each run using Equation 8 of this section.

(ix) The owner or operator of a kiln with an in-line raw mill and subject to limitations on PM emissions shall demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests while the raw mill is under normal operating conditions and while the raw mill is not operating, and calculate the time weighted average emissions. The operating limit will then be determined using 63.1349(b)(1)(i) of this section.
