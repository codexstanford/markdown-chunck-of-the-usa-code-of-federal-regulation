2.1 Chemiluminescence NO/NO/NOanalyzers will respond to other nitrogen containing compounds, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), which might be reduced to NO in the thermal converter. () Atmospheric concentrations of these potential interferences are generally low relative to NOand valid NOmeasurements may be obtained. In certain geographical areas, where the concentration of these potential interferences is known or suspected to be high relative to NO, the use of an equivalent method for the measurement of NOis recommended.

2.2 The use of integrating flasks on the sample inlet line of chemiluminescence NO/NO/NOanalyzers is optional and left to couraged. The sample residence time between the sampling point and the analyzer should be kept to a minimum to avoid erroneous NOmeasurements resulting from the reaction of ambient levels of NO and Oin the sampling system.

2.3 The use of particulate filters on the sample inlet line of chemiluminescence NO/NO/NOanalyzers is optional and left to the discretion of the user or the manufacturer.

3. An analyzer based on this principle will be considered a reference method only if it has been designated as a reference method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.
