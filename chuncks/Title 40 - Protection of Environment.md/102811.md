(12) Determine the response factor as a function of molar water concentration and use this response factor to account for the CHresponse for NMHC determination described in ยง 1065.660(b)(2)(iii). Humidify the CHspan gas as described in ยง 1065.365(d)(11) and repeat the steps in paragraphs (d)(7) through (9) of this section until measurements are complete for each setpoint in the selected range. Divide each mean measured CHconcentration by the recorded span concentration of the CH4 calibration gas, adjusted for water content, to determine the FID analyzer's CHresponse factor,. Use the CHresponse factors at the different setpoints to create a functional relationship between response factor and molar water concentration, downstream of the last sample dryer if any sample dryers are present. Use this functional relationship to determine the response factor during an emission test.
