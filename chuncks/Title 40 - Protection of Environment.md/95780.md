####### Test chambers.

(ii)(A) Materials and equipment that contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals from the dilution water and should not contain substances that can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect test results.

(B) For renewal tests, daphnids can be conveniently exposed to the test solution in 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers.

(C) For flow-through tests daphnids can be exposed in glass or stainless steel containers with stainless steel or nylon screen bottoms. Such containers shall be suspended in the test chamber in such a manner to ensure that the test solution flows regularly into and out of the container and that the daphnids are always submerged in at least 5 centimeters of test solution. Test chambers can be constructed using 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers equipped with screened overflow holes, standpipes or V-shaped notches.

(D) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
