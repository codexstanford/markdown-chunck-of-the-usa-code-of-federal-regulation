b. Mobile sources can be modeled in AERMOD as either line (elongated area) sources or as a series of volume sources. However, since mobile source modeling usually includes an analysis of very near-source impacts (hot-spot modeling, which can include receptors within 5-10 meters (m) of the roadway), the results can be highly sensitive to the characterization of the mobile emissions. Important characteristics for both line/area and volume sources include the plume release height, source width, and initial dispersion characteristics, and should also take into account the impact of traffic-induced turbulence that can cause roadway sources to have larger initial dimensions than might normally be used for representing line sources.
