####### Prohibited controls.

(2)The following controls are prohibited:

(i) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems so they cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating.

(ii) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems with features that disable, deactivate, or bypass the emission controls, either actively or passively. For example, you may not include a manual vent that the operator can open to bypass emission controls. You may ask us to allow such features if needed for safety reasons or if the features are fully functional during emission tests described in subpart F of this part.
