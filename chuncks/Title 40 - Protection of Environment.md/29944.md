####### ยง 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Combustion system leaks.

(5)(i) Combustion system leaks of hazardous air pollutants must be controlled by:

(A) Keeping the combustion zone sealed to prevent combustion system leaks; or

(B) Maintaining the maximum combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor; or

(C) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, an alternative means of control to provide control of combustion system leaks equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure; or

(D) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, other technique(s) which can be demonstrated to prevent fugitive emissions without use of instantaneous pressure limits; and

(ii) You must specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the method that will be used to control combustion system leaks. If you control combustion system leaks by maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor, you must also specify in the performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the monitoring and recording frequency of the pressure monitor, and specify how the monitoring approach will be integrated into the automatic waste feed cutoff system.
