(ii) Based on your engine design, estimate maximum power,, the design speed at maximum power, &#x192;, the design maximum intake manifold boost pressure,, and temperature,. Also, estimate a mean fraction of power that is lost due to friction and pumping,. Use this information along with the engine displacement volume,, an approximate volumetric efficiency, &#x3B7;, and the number of engine strokes per power stroke (two-stroke or four-stroke),, to estimate the maximum raw exhaust molar flow rate,.

(iii) Use your estimated values as described in the following example calculation:

(2) To estimate the flow-weighted mean NMHC concentration in a CVS from a naturally aspirated nonroad spark-ignition engine at an NMHC standard of 0.5 g/(kW&#xB7;hr), you may do the following:
