###### Monitoring and Compliance Provisions
####### § 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Operating requirement.

(ii)You must not exceed a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to a maximum theoretical emission concentration (MTEC) of 120 µg/dscm on a twelve-hour rolling average.

(iii) To document compliance with the operating requirement of paragraph (b)(15)(ii) of this section, you must:

(A) Monitor and record the feedrate of mercury for each hazardous waste feedstream according to § 63.1209(c);

(B) Monitor with a CMS and record in the operating record the gas flowrate (either directly or by monitoring a surrogate parameter that you have correlated to gas flowrate);

(C) Continuously calculate and record in the operating record a MTEC assuming mercury from all hazardous waste feedstreams is emitted;

(D) Interlock the MTEC calculated in paragraph (b)(15)(iii)(C) of this section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the MTEC exceeds the operating requirement of paragraph (b)(15)(ii) of this section.

(iv) In lieu of the requirement in paragraph (b)(15)(iii) of this section, you may:

(A) Identify in the Notification of Compliance a minimum gas flowrate limit and a maximum feedrate limit of mercury from all hazardous waste feedstreams that ensures the MTEC calculated in paragraph (b)(15)(iii)(C) of this section is below the operating requirement of paragraph (b)(15)(ii) of this section; and

(B) Interlock the minimum gas flowrate limit and maximum feedrate limits in paragraph (b)(15)(iv)(A) of this section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the gas flowrate or mercury feedrate exceeds the limits in paragraph (b)(15)(iv)(A) of this section.
