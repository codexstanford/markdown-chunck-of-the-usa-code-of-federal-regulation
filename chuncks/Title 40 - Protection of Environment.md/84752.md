Respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 150. The following NIOSH-certified respirators meet the requirements of § 721.63(a)(4): Supplied-air respirator operated in positive pressure demand or other positive pressure mode and equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece. As an alternative to the respirator requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.1 mg/mas an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the § 721.63 respirator may request to do as under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those listed in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.
