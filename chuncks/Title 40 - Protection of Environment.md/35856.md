######## Extended cookout (ECO)

means a cellulose ether process change that reduces the amount of unreacted ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, or chloroacetic acid leaving the reactor. This is accomplished by allowing the product to react for a longer time, thereby leaving less unreacted ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, or chloroacetic acid and reducing emissions of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, or chloroacetic acid that might have occurred otherwise.
