###### ยง 600.114-12 Vehicle-specific 5-cycle fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission calculations.
####### Highway fuel economy.

(b)(1) For each vehicle tested under ยง 600.010-08(a), (b), or (c), as applicable, determine the 5-cycle highway fuel economy using the following equation:

(2) If the condition specified in ยง 600.115-08(b)(2)(iii)(B) is met, in lieu of using the calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the manufacturer may optionally determine the highway fuel economy using the following modified 5-cycle equation which utilizes data from FTP, HFET, and US06 tests, and applies mathematic adjustments for Cold FTP and SC03 conditions:

(i) Perform a US06 test in addition to the FTP and HFET tests.

(ii) Determine the 5-cycle highway fuel economy according to the following formula:

(3) Terms used in the equations in this paragraph (b) are defined as follows:
