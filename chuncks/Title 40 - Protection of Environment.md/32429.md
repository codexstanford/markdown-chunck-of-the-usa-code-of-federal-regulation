###### § 63.1426 Process vent requirements for determining organic HAP concentration, control efficiency, and aggregated organic HAP emission reduction for a PMPU.
####### Determination of organic HAP concentration and control efficiency.

(c)Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an owner or operator using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to comply with an epoxide or organic HAP percent reduction efficiency requirement in § 63.1425(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(3)(ii), or (d)(2); an epoxide concentration limitation in § 63.1425(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii); or an annual epoxide emission limitation in § 63.1425(b)(1)(iii) or (b)(2)(iv), shall conduct a performance test using the applicable procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. The organic HAP or epoxide concentration and percent reduction may be measured as total epoxide, total organic HAP, or as TOC minus methane and ethane according to the procedures specified. When conducting testing in accordance with this section, the owner or operator is only required to measure HAP of concern for the specific requirement for which compliance is being determined. For instance, to determine compliance with the epoxide emission requirement of § 63.1425(b), the owner or operator is only required to measure epoxide control efficiency or outlet concentration.
