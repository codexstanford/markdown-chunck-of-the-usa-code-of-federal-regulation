###### Summary of Method.

2.1This protocol was developed by Environment Canada to provide a relatively rapid and simple testing procedure for evaluating dispersant effectiveness (2). It uses a modified Erlenmeyer flask to which a side spout has been added for removing subsurface samples of water near the bottom of the flask without disturbing a surface oil layer. Seawater and a surface layer of oil are added to the flask. Turbulent mixing is provided by placing the flask on a standard shaker table at 150 rpm for 20 minutes to induce a swirling motion to the liquid contents. Following shaking, the flask is immediately removed from the shaker table and maintained in a stationary position for 10 minutes to allow the oil that will reform a slick to return to the water's surface. A sample of water for chemical analysis is then removed from the bottom of the flask through the side spout, extracted with methylene chloride (dichloromethane-DCM), and analyzed for oil content by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 340, 370, and 400 nm (2).
