###### § 1033.301 Applicability.

The requirements of this part apply to manufacturers/remanufacturers of locomotives certified under this part, with the following exceptions:

(a) The requirements of §§ 1033.310, 1033.315, 1033.320, and 1033.330 apply only to manufacturers of freshly manufactured locomotives or locomotive engines (including those used for repowering). We may also apply these requirements to remanufacturers of any locomotives for which there is reason to believe production problems exist that could affect emission performance. When we make a determination that production problems may exist that could affect emission performance, we will notify the remanufacturer(s). The requirements of §§ 1033.310, 1033.315, 1033.320, and 1033.330 will apply as specified in the notice.

(b) The requirements of § 1033.335 apply only to remanufacturers.

(c) As specified in § 1033.1(d), we may apply the requirements of this subpart to manufacturers/remanufacturers that do not certify the locomotives. However, unless we specify otherwise, the requirements of this subpart apply to manufacturers/remanufacturers that hold the certificates for the locomotives.
