######## Complete local source water assessment for ground water protection areas.

(b)When EPA has approved a State's Drinking Water Source Assessment and Protection Program, States will begin to conduct local assessments for each public water system in their State. For the purposes of this rule, local assessments for community water systems and non-transient non-community systems are complete when four requirements are met: First, a State must delineate the boundaries of the assessment area for community and non-transient non-community water systems. Second, the State must identify significant potential sources of contamination in these delineated areas. Third, the State must "determine the susceptibility of community and non-transient non-community water systems in the delineated area to such contaminants." Lastly, each State will develop its own plan for making the completed assessments available to the public.
