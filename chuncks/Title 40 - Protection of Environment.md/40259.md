###### Flow Measurement Device.

6.15Type S Pitot tube (or equivalent) and Magnahelic set for measurement of volumetric flow rate.

HCl can be purchased in a standard compressed gas cylinder. The most stable HCl cylinder mixture available has a concentration certified at +/-5 percent. Such a cylinder is suitable for performing analyte spiking because it will provide reproducible samples. The stability of the cylinder can be monitored over time by periodically performing direct FTIR analysis of cylinder samples. It is recommended that a 10-50 ppm cylinder of HCl be prepared having from 2-5 ppm SF6 as a tracer compound. (See sections 7.1 through 7.3 of Method 320 of this appendix for a complete description of the use of existing HCl reference spectra. See section 9.1 of Method 320 of this appendix for a complete discussion of standard concentration selection.)
