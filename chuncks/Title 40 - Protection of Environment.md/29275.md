######## Simplifying assumptions for entrance mean concentration.

(d)If you are complying with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may elect to determine the entrance mean concentration as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) Assume that the entrance mean concentration of the monitored substance is zero; or,

(2) Determine the entrance mean concentration of a monitored substance at a sampling location anywhere upstream of the heat exchanger or heat exchange system, provided that there is not a reasonable opportunity for the concentration to change at the entrance to each heat exchanger or heat exchange system.

(e) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in ยง 63.1081(a), you must perform monitoring to identify leaks of total strippable hydrocarbons from each heat exchange system subject to the requirements of this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
