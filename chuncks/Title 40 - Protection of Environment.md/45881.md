####### Test Procedures and Criteria

1.

a. Set up the circuit in accordance with Figure 1. Operate the circuit by an applicable distributor or equivalent triggering device and applicable primarly resistor with a 50 pf load at 14.0 +/-0.50 volts DC input as applicable and stabilized at an ambient temperature of 20 &#xB0;C +/-3 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F +/-5 &#xB0;F).

b. With the original equipment coil installed, record the predominant minimum peak voltage and rise time at 300 and 500 distributor rpm, and at 500 rpm intervals up to the maximum intended operating speed. The measurement is to be taken after 4 minutes operation at each speed.

c. Install the replacement coil to be tested and repeat step b. above.

d. The replacement coil shall have an open-circuit output voltage (M-3) at least 90% of the OE coil output voltage and a rise time not to exceed 110% of original equipment coil at each distributor test speed.
