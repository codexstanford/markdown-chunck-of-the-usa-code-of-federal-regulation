####### Transfer rack

means a single system used to fill bulk cargo tanks mounted on or in a truck or railcar. A transfer rack includes all loading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and equipment necessary for the transfer operation. Transfer equipment and operations that are physically separate (i.e., do not share common piping, valves, and other equipment) are considered to be separate transfer racks.
