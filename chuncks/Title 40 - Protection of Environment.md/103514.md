######## Sample media and sampler preparation.

(b)Prepare pre-cleaned PM filters and pre-cleaned PUF plugs/XAD-2 as needed. Store sample media in containers protected from light and ambient air if you do not use them immediately after cleaning. Use the following preparation procedure, or an analogous procedure with different solvents and extraction times:

(1) Pre-clean the filters via Soxhlet extraction with methylene chloride for 24 hours and dry over dry nitrogen in a low-temperature vacuum oven.

(2) Pre-clean PUF and XAD-2 with a series of Soxhlet extractions: 8 hours with water, 22 hours with methanol, 22 hours with methylene chloride, and 22 hours with toluene, followed by drying with nitrogen.

(3) Clean sampler components, including the probe, filter holder, condenser, sorbent module, and condensate collection vessel by rinsing three times with methylene chloride and then three times with toluene. Prepare pre-cleaned aluminum foil for capping the probe inlet of the sampler after the sampling system has been assembled.
