###### Definitions
####### ยง 63.12005 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Heat exchange system,i.e.,,e.g.,

means a device or collection of devices used to transfer heat from process fluids to water without intentional direct contact of the process fluid with the water (non-contact heat exchanger) and to transport and/or cool the water in a closed-loop recirculation system (cooling tower system) or a once-through system (river or pond water). For closed-loop recirculation systems, the heat exchange system consists of a cooling tower, all heat exchangers that are serviced by that cooling tower and all water lines to and from the heat exchanger(s). For once-through systems, the heat exchange system consists of one or more heat exchangers servicing an individual process unit and all water lines to and from the heat exchanger(s). Intentional direct contact with process fluids results in the formation of a wastewater.
