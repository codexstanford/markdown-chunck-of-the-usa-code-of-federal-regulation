####### Volatile organic concentration,VO concentration

ormeans the fraction by weight of the volatile organic compounds contained in a hazardous waste expressed in terms of parts per million (ppmw) as determined by direct measurement or by knowledge of the waste in accordance with the requirements of ยง 265.1084 of this subpart. For the purpose of determining the VO concentration of a hazardous waste, organic compounds with a Henry's law constant value of at least 0.1 mole-fraction-in-the-gas-phase/mole-fraction-in the liquid-phase (0.1 Y/X) (which can also be expressed as 1.8 x 10atmospheres/gram-mole/m) at 25 degrees Celsius must be included. Appendix VI of this subpart presents a list of compounds known to have a Henry's law constant value less than the cutoff level.
