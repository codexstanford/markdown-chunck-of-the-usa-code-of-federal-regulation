###### Method for Forming an Amalgam.

13.2

1. Place the waste solution in an uncapped vessel in a hood.

2. For each liter of waste solution, add approximately 10 g of sodium carbonate until neutralization has occurred (NaOH may have to be used).

3. Following neutralization, add 10 g of granular zinc or magnesium.

4. Stir the solution in a hood for 24 hours. Caution must be exercised as hydrogen gas is evolved by this treatment process.

5. After 24 hours, allow the solution to stand without stirring to allow the mercury amalgam (solid black material) to settle to the bottom of the waste receptacle.

6. Upon settling, decant and discard the supernatant liquid.

7. Quantitatively transfer the solid material to a container and allow to dry.

8. The solid material can be sent to a mercury reclaiming plant. It must not be discarded.
