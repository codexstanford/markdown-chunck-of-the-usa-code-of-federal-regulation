##### Subpart G - Reporting Requirements
###### § 75.68 Temporary modifications to otherwise applicable quality-assurance requirements during the COVID-19 national emergency.
####### § 75.74 Annual and ozone season monitoring and reporting requirements.
######## i.e.

(v) The results of RATAs (and any other quality assurance test(s) required under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section) which affect data validation for the current ozone season, but which were performed outside the ozone season (, between January 1 and April 30 of the current calendar year), shall be reported in the quarterly report for the second quarter of the current calendar year (or in the report for the third calendar quarter of the current calendar year, if the unit or stack does not operate in the second quarter).

(7) The owner or operator shall use only quality-assured data from within ozone seasons in the substitute data procedures under subpart D of this part and section 2.4.2 of appendix D to this part.

(i) The lookback periods (e.g., 2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours for a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, a NOconcentration monitoring system, or a flow monitoring system) used to calculate missing data must include only quality-assured data from periods within ozone seasons.

(ii) The applicable missing data procedures of §§ 75.31 through 75.37 shall be used, with one exception. When a fuel which has a significantly higher NOemission rate than any of the fuel(s) combusted in prior ozone seasons is combusted in the unit, and no quality-assured NOdata have been recorded in the current, or any previous, ozone season while combusting the new fuel, the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, from a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, or the maximum potential concentration of NO, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, from a NOconcentration monitoring system. The maximum potential value used shall be specific to the new fuel. The owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential value for each hour of missing NOdata until the first hour that quality-assured NOdata are obtained while combusting the new fuel, and then shall resume use of the missing data routines in §§ 75.31 through 75.37; and

(iii) In order to apply the missing data routines described in §§ 75.31 through 75.37 on an ozone season-only basis, the procedures in those sections shall be modified as follows:

(A) The use of the initial missing data procedures in § 75.31 shall commence with the first unit operating hour in the first ozone season for which emissions data are required to be reported under § 75.64.

(B) In § 75.31(a), the phrases "During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" and "during the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" apply respectively instead of the phrases "During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours" and "during the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours".

(C) In § 75.32(a), the phrases "the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" and "the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" apply, respectively, instead of the phrases "the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours" and "the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours".

(D) In § 75.32(a)(1), the phrase "Following initial certification, prior to completion of 3,672 unit (or stack) operating hours within the ozone season" applies instead of the phrase "Prior to completion of 8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours following initial certification".

(E) In Equation 8, the phrase "Total unit operating hours within the ozone season" applies instead of the phrase "Total unit operating hours".

(F) In § 75.32(a)(2), the phrase "3,672 unit (or stack) operating hours within the ozone season" applies instead of the phrase "8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours".

(G) In the numerator of Equation 9, the phrase "Total unit operating hours within the ozone season" applies instead of the phrase "Total unit operating hours", and the phrase "3,672 unit operating hours within the ozone season" applies instead of the phrase "8,760 unit operating hours". In the denominator of Equation 9, the number "3,672" applies instead of "8,760".

(H) Use the following instead of the first three sentences in § 75.32(a)(3): "When calculating percent monitor data availability using Equation 8 or 9, the owner or operator shall include all unit or stack operating hours within the ozone season, and all monitor operating hours within the ozone season for which quality-assured data were recorded by a certified primary monitor; a certified redundant or non-redundant backup monitor or a reference method for that unit; or by an approved alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part. No hours from more than three years (26,280 clock hours) earlier shall be used in Equation 9. For a unit that has accumulated fewer than 3,672 ozone season operating hours in the previous three years, use the following: in the numerator of Equation 9 use 'Total unit operating hours within the ozone season for which quality-assured data were recorded in the previous three years'; and in the denominator of Equation 9 use 'Total unit operating hours within the ozone season, in the previous three years' "

(I) In § 75.33(a), the phrases "the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" and "the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" apply, respectively, instead of the phrases "the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours" and "the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours".

(J) Instead of the last sentence of § 75.33(a), use "For the purposes of missing data substitution, the owner or operator of a unit shall use only quality-assured monitor operating hours of data that were recorded within the ozone season and no more than three years (26,280 clock hours) prior to the date and time of the missing data period."

(K) In §§ 75.33(b), 75.33(c), 75.35, 75.36, and 75.37, the phrases "720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" and "2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" apply, respectively, instead of the phrases "720 quality-assured monitor operating hours" and "2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours".

(L) In § 75.34(a)(3) and (a)(5), the phrases "720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" and "2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season" apply instead of "720 quality-assured monitor operating hours" and "2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours", respectively.

(8) The owner or operator of a unit with NOadd-on emission controls or a unit capable of combusting more than one fuel shall keep records during ozone season in a form suitable for inspection to demonstrate that the typical NOemission rate or NOconcentration during the prior ozone season(s) included in the missing data lookback period is representative of the ozone season in which missing data are substituted and that use of the missing data procedures will not systematically underestimate NOmass emissions. These records shall include:

(i) For units that can combust more than one fuel, the fuel or fuels combusted each hour; and

(ii) For units with add-on emission controls, using the missing data options in §§ 75.34(a)(1) through 75.34(a)(5), the range of operating parameters for add-on emission controls (as defined in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit required by section 1 in appendix B to this part) and information for verifying proper operation of the add-on emission controls during missing data periods, as described in § 75.34(d).

(9) The designated representative shall certify with each quarterly report that NOemission rate values or NOconcentration values substituted for missing data under subpart D of this part are calculated using only values from an ozone season, that substitute values measured during the prior ozone season(s) included in the missing data lookback period are representative of the ozone season in which missing data are substituted, and that NOemissions are not systematically underestimated.
