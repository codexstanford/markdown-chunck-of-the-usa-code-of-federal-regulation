######## Non-cyanide electrolytic plating and electropolishing processes

means electroplating, electroforming, and electropolishing that uses or emits any of the plating and polishing metal HAP, as defined in this section, performed without cyanide in the tank. These processes do not use cyanide in the tank and operate at pH values less than 12. These processes use electricity and add or remove metals such as metal HAP from parts and products used in manufacturing. Both electroplating and electroforming can be performed with cyanide as well.
