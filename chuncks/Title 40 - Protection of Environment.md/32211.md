() An owner or operator may choose to test only those periods of the batch emission episode during which the emission rate for the entire batch emission episode can be determined or during which the organic HAP emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate (kilogram per unit time) over the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the emission profile provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in the site-specific test plan required by ยง 63.1417(h)(2).
