####### Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems.

2.2.2A non-redundant backup monitoring system is a separate Hg CEMS or sorbent trap system that has been certified at a particular unit or stack location, but is not permanently installed at that location. Rather, the system is kept on "cold standby" and may be reinstalled in the event of a primary monitoring system outage. A non-redundant backup monitoring system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Non-redundant backup Hg CEMS must complete the same certification tests as the primary monitoring system, with one exception. The 7-day calibration error test is not required for a non-redundant backup Hg CEMS. Except as otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a non-redundant backup monitoring system may only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location.
