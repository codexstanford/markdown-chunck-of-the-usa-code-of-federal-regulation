###### ยง 61.226 Reconsideration of rescission and reinstatement of this subpart.
####### Reinstatement of this subpart upon completion of reconsideration of rescission.

(a)(1) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has:

(i) Failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m-s flux standard; and

(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.

(2) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record:

(i) That NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed in significant part on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States; and

(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.

(3) Upon completion of the reconsideration of rescission pursuant to ยง 61.226(c) the Administrator may issue a finding that reinstatement of this subpart is not appropriate if the Administrator finds:

(i) NRC and the affected Agreement States are on a programmatic basis implementing and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m-s flux standard; or

(ii) NRC or an affected Agreement State are on a site-specific basis, in significant part, achieving compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States.
