####### Volumetric flow rate.

(f)The process vent volumetric flow rate (Q), in standard cubic meters per minute at 20 &#xB0;C, shall be determined as specified in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section and shall be recorded as specified in ยง 63.1109(d).

(1) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate. If the process vent tested passes through a final steam jet ejector and is not condensed, the stream volumetric flow shall be corrected to 2.3 percent moisture; or

(2) The engineering assessment procedures in paragraph (k) of this section can be used for determining volumetric flow rates.
