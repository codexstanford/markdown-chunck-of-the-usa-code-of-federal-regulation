The engineering basis of the calculation procedures and all inputs and assumptions made in the calculations shall be documented.

(iv) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control technology will be operated in conformance with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters).

(2) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days whether an application presents sufficient information to determine nominal efficiency. The Administrator reserves the right to request specific data in addition to the items listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

(3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days of the submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish anotice establishing a nominal efficiency for the control technology.

(4) The Administrator may grant permission to take emission credits for use of the control technology. The Administrator may also impose requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.

(5) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use or design from the reference control technology and the different control technology will be used in no more than three applications at a single plant site, the owner or operator shall submit the information listed in paragraph (i)(1)(i) as specified in § 63.506(e)(7)(ii) to the Administrator.

(ii) If, in reviewing the application, the permitting authority believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the technology for broad applicability and may publish anotice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the specific application.

(6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines that the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application.

(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures for storage vessels, continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, and wastewater streams:

(1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice which meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions, while the same product is produced.

(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include substitution of feedstocks that reduce organic HAP emissions; alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.

(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990, may be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.

(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction is used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(7) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.

(ii) Equation 52 shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.

(A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, E, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for continuous front-end process vents, paragraph (g)(3) of this section for storage vessels, paragraph (g)(6) of this section for batch front-end process vents, and paragraph (g)(7) of this section for aggregate batch vent streams.

(B) For wastewater, Eshall be calculated according to § 63.150(j)(2)(ii)(B).

(C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to September 5, 1996, records may be used to determine E.

(D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, E, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio may be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.

(E) For wastewater, Eshall be calculated according to § 63.150(j)(2)(ii)(E).

(iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.

(iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in emissions for each emission point shall be calculated.

(v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section, used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology or standard, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of an affected source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.

(k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the emissions average will not result in greater hazard, or at the option of the Administrator, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501.

(1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the Administrator.

(i) The Administrator may require owners and operators to use specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk determination.

(ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made according to any guidance that the Administrator makes available for use.

(2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their operating permit application or in their Emissions Averaging Plan if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.

(3) An Emissions Averaging Plan that does not demonstrate hazard or risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the Emissions Averaging Plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the emissions average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501.

(4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:

(i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;

(ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and

(iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such demonstrations.

(l) For periods of monitoring excursions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of monitoring excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.506(e)(6).

(2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures for demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.

(3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the excursion and the other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.

(4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.

(m) For each emission point included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting equivalent to that required for Group 1 emission points complying with §§ 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.493, and 63.501, as applicable. If back-end process operations are included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting equivalent to that required for back-end process operations complying with § 63.493.
