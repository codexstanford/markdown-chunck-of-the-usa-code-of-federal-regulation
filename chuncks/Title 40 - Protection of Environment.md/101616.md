###### ยง 1048.110 How must my engines diagnose malfunctions?
####### Consider exceptions for certain conditions.

(f)Your diagnostic systems may disregard trouble codes for the first three minutes after engine starting. You may ask us to approve diagnostic-system designs that disregard trouble codes under other conditions that would produce an unreliable reading, damage systems or components, or cause other safety risks. This might include operation at altitudes over 8,000 feet.
