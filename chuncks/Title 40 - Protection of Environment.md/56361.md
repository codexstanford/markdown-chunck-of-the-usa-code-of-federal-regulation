###### Disinfection Profile
####### § 141.532 How does my system develop a disinfection profile and when must it begin?

A disinfection profile consists of three steps:

(a) First, your system must collect data for several parameters from the plant as discussed in § 141.533 over the course of 12 months. If your system serves between 500 and 9,999 persons you must begin to collect data no later than July 1, 2003. If your system serves fewer than 500 persons you must begin to collect data no later than January 1, 2004.

(b) Second, your system must use this data to calculate weekly log inactivation as discussed in §§ 141.534 and 141.535; and

(c) Third, your system must use these weekly log inactivations to develop a disinfection profile as specified in § 141.536.
