######## Procedure.
######### Procedure.
########## Measurement principles.

(b)Interference gases can positively interfere with certain analyzers by causing a response similar to NO. If the analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification, simultaneously conduct these other measurements to test the compensation algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.
