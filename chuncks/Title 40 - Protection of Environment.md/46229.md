####### Comprehensive component monitoring,General.

(3)-(i)Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the OBD system must detect a malfunction of any electronic engine component or system not otherwise described in paragraphs (g), (h), (i)(1), and (i)(2) of this section that either provides input to (directly or indirectly, such components may include the crank angle sensor, knock sensor, throttle position sensor, cam position sensor, intake air temperature sensor, boost pressure sensor, manifold pressure sensor, mass air flow sensor, exhaust temperature sensor, exhaust pressure sensor, fuel pressure sensor, fuel composition sensor of a flexible fuel vehicle, etc.) or receives commands from (such components or systems may include the idle speed control system, glow plug system, variable length intake manifold runner systems, supercharger or turbocharger electronic components, heated fuel preparation systems, the wait-to-start lamp on diesel applications, the MIL, etc.) the onboard computer(s) and meets either of the criteria described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) and/or (i)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Note that, for the purposes of this paragraph (i)(3), "electronic engine component or system" does not include components that are driven by the engine and are not related to the control of the fueling, air handling, or emissions of the engine (e.g., PTO components, air conditioning system components, and power steering components).

(A) It can cause emissions to exceed applicable emission standards. To preclude monitoring, the manufacturer must be able to provide emission data showing that the component or system, when malfunctioning and installed on a suitable test engine, does not cause emissions to exceed the emission standards.

(B) It is used as part of the monitoring strategy for any other monitored system or component.
