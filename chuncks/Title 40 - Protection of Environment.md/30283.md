(4)(i) You may use any scientifically-accepted peer-reviewed risk assessment methodology for your site-specific compliance demonstration to calculate an annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each on-site hazardous waste combustor. An example of one approach for performing the demonstration for air toxics can be found in the EPA's "Air Toxics Risk Assessment Reference Library, Volume 2, Site-Specific Risk Assessment Technical Resource Document," which may be obtained through the EPA's Air Toxics Web site at

(ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is the HCl-equivalent emission rate that ensures that the Hazard Index associated with maximum annual average exposures is not greater than 1.0 rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1).

(iii) To determine the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, your site-specific compliance demonstration must, at a minimum:

(A) Estimate long-term inhalation exposures through the estimation of annual or multi-year average ambient concentrations;

(B) Estimate the inhalation exposure for the actual individual most exposed to the facility's emissions from hazardous waste combustors, considering off-site locations where people reside and where people congregate for work, school, or recreation;

(C) Use site-specific, quality-assured data wherever possible;

(D) Use health-protective default assumptions wherever site-specific data are not available, and:

(E) Contain adequate documentation of the data and methods used for the assessment so that it is transparent and can be reproduced by an experienced risk assessor and emissions measurement expert.

(iv) Your site-specific compliance demonstration need not:

(A) Assume any attenuation of exposure concentrations due to the penetration of outdoor pollutants into indoor exposure areas;

(B) Assume any reaction or deposition of the emitted pollutants during transport from the emission point to the point of exposure.
