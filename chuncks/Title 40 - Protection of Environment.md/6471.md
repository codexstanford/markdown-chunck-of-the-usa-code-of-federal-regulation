###### Establish "Z" values.

12.3.1.4The "Z" value is the result of an analysis that you must perform to determine if the Cis acceptable. Compare the calculated cyclone IV D(either Equation 34 or 35) to the re-established cyclone IV D(either Equation 36 or 37) values based upon the test condition calculated Reynolds number (Equation 39). Follow these procedures.

(a) Use Equation 39 to calculate the "Z" values. If the "Z" value is between 0.99 and 1.01, the Dvalue is the best estimate of the cyclone IV Dcut diameter for your test run.

(b) If the "Z" value is greater than 1.01 or less than 0.99, re-establish a Cbased on the Dvalue determined in either Equations 36 or 37, depending upon the test condition Reynolds number.

(c) Use the second revised Cto re-calculate the cyclone IV D.

(d) Repeat this iterative process as many times as necessary using the prescribed equations until you achieve the criteria documented in Equation 40.

12.3.2 Particulate Concentration. Use the particulate catch weights in the combined cyclone sampling train to calculate the concentration of PM in the various size ranges. You must correct the concentrations for the acetone blank.
