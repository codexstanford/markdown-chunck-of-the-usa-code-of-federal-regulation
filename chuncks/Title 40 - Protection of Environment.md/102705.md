####### ยง 1065.290 PM gravimetric balance.
######## Pan design.

(c)We recommend that you use a balance pan designed to minimize corner loading of the balance, as follows:

(1) Use a pan that centers the PM sample media (such as a filter) on the weighing pan. For example, use a pan in the shape of a cross that has upswept tips that center the PM sample media on the pan.

(2) Use a pan that positions the PM sample as low as possible.
