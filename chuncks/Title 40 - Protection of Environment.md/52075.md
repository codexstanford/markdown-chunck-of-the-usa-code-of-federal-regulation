### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 98 - MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING
##### Subpart L - Fluorinated Gas Production
###### ยง 98.121 Reporting threshold.

You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if your facility contains a fluorinated gas production process that generates or emits fluorinated GHG and the facility meets the requirements of either ยง 98.2(a)(1) or (a)(2). To calculate GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton COe per year emission threshold in ยง 98.2(a)(2), calculate process emissions from fluorinated gas production using uncontrolled GHG emissions.
