() At least four analyzable concentrations shall be used. Where there is cytotoxicity, these concentrations shall cover a range from the maximum to little or no toxicity; this will usually mean that the concentration levels should be separated by no more than a factor between 2 and &#x221A;10. If the maximum concentration is based on cytotoxicity then it shall result in approximately 10-20% but not less than 10% relative survival (relative cloning efficiency) or relative total growth. For relatively non-cytotoxic compounds the maximum concentration should be 5 mg/ml, 5 µl/ml, or 0.01 M, whichever is the lowest.
