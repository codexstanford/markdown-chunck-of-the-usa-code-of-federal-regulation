####### ยง 63.4161 How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
######## Calculate the organic HAP emissions reduction for controlled coating operations not using liquid-liquid material balance.

(g)For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate organic HAP emissions reduction, using Equation 1 of this section, by applying the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period. For any period of time a deviation specified in ยง 63.4163(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled coating operation, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation. You must not include those materials in the calculations of organic HAP emissions reduction in Equation 1 of this section.

(1) Calculate the kg of organic HAP in the coatings used in the controlled coating operation, using Equation 1A of this section:

(2) Calculate the kg of organic HAP in the thinners used in the controlled coating operation, using Equation 1B of this section:

(3) Calculate the kg of organic HAP in the cleaning materials used in the controlled coating operation during the compliance period, using Equation 1C of this section:
