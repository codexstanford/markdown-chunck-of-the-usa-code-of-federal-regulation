###### Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls Option
####### § 63.4151 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?

You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation(s) in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation(s) must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 but not the operating limits or work practice standards in §§ 63.4092 and 63.4093, respectively, during the initial compliance period. You must meet all of the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 for the coating operation(s). When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option.
