####### Volume Additive Reconciliation (VAR) Period

means the following:

(1) For an automated detergent blending facility, the VAR period is a time period lasting no more than 31 days or until an adjustment to a detergent concentration rate that increases the initial rate by more than 10 percent, whichever occurs first. The concentration setting for a detergent injector may be adjusted by more than 10 percent above the initial rate without terminating the VAR Period, provided the purpose of the change is to correct a batch misadditization prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction and the concentration is immediately returned to no more than 10 percent above the initial rate of concentration after the correction.

(2) For a non-automated detergent blending facility, the VAR Period constitutes the blending of one batch of gasoline.
