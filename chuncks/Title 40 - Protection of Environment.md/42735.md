##### Subpart F - Recordkeeping Requirements
###### ยง 75.58 General recordkeeping provisions for specific situations.
####### Specific NO,emission record provisions for gas-fired peaking units or oil-fired peaking units using optional protocol in appendix E to this part.

(d)In lieu of recording the information in ยง 75.57(d), the owner or operator shall record the applicable information in this paragraph for each affected gas-fired peaking unit or oil-fired peaking unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional protocol in appendix E to this part for estimating NOemission rate. The owner or operator shall meet the requirements of this section, except that the requirements under paragraphs (d)(1)(vii) and (d)(2)(vii) of this section shall become applicable on the date on which the owner or operator is required to monitor, record, and report NOmass emissions under an applicable State or federal NOmass emission reduction program, if the provisions of subpart H of this part are adopted as requirements under such a program.

(1) For each hour when the unit is combusting oil:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Hourly average mass flow rate of oil while the unit combusts oil with the units in which oil flow is recorded (lb/hr);

(iii) Gross calorific value of oil used to determine heat input (Btu/lb);

(iv) Hourly average NOemission rate from combustion of oil (lb/mmBtu, rounded to the nearest hundredth);

(v) Heat input rate of oil (mmBtu/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vi) Fuel usage time for combustion of oil during the hour (rounded up to the nearest fraction of an hour, in equal increments that can range from one hundredth to one quarter of an hour, at the option of the owner or operator);

(vii) NOmass emissions, calculated in accordance with section 8.1 of appendix F to this part;

(viii) NOmonitoring system identification code;

(ix) Fuel flow monitoring system identification code;

(x) Segment identification of the correlation curve; and

(xi) Heat input rate formula ID (required beginning January 1, 2009).

(2) For each hour when the unit is combusting gaseous fuel:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Hourly average fuel flow rate of gaseous fuel, while the unit combusts gas (100 scfh);

(iii) Gross calorific value of gaseous fuel used to determine heat input (Btu/100 scf) (flag value if derived from missing data procedures);

(iv) Hourly average NOemission rate from combustion of gaseous fuel (lb/mmBtu, rounded to nearest hundredth);

(v) Heat input rate from gaseous fuel, while the unit combusts gas (mmBtu/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(vi) Fuel usage time for combustion of gaseous fuel during the hour (rounded up to the nearest fraction of an hour, in equal increments that can range from one hundredth to one quarter of an hour, at the option of the owner or operator);

(vii) NOmass emissions, calculated in accordance with section 8.1 of appendix F to this part;

(viii) NOmonitoring system identification code;

(ix) Fuel flow monitoring system identification code;

(x) Segment identification of the correlation curve; and

(xi) Heat input rate formula ID (required beginning January 1, 2009).

(3) For each hour when the unit combusts multiple fuels:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Hourly average heat input rate from all fuels (mmBtu/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth); and

(iii) Hourly average NOemission rate for the unit for all fuels (lb/mmBtu, rounded to the nearest hundredth).

(4) For each hour when the unit combusts any fuel(s):

(i) For stationary gas turbines and diesel or dual-fuel reciprocating engines, hourly averages of operating parameters under section 2.3 of appendix E to this part (flag if value is outside of manufacturer's recommended range); and

(ii) For boilers, hourly average boiler Oreading (percent, rounded to the nearest tenth) (flag if value exceeds by more than 2 percentage points the Olevel recorded at the same heat input during the previous NOemission rate test); and

(iii) On and after April 27, 2011, operating condition codes for the following:

(A) Unit operated on emergency fuel;

(B) Correlation curve for the fuel mixture has expired;

(C) Operating parameter is outside of normal limits;

(D) Uncontrolled hour;

(E) Operation above highest tested heat input rate point on the curve;

(F) Operating parameter data missing or invalid;

(G) Designated operational and control equipment parameters within normal limits; and

(H) Operation below lowest tested heat input rate point on the curve.

(5) For each fuel sample:

(i) Date of sampling;

(ii) Gross calorific value (Btu/lb for oil, Btu/100 scf for gaseous fuel); and

(iii) Density or specific gravity, if required to convert volume to mass.

(6) Flag to indicate multiple or single fuels combusted.
