####### General.

(a)Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide fluazifop-P-butyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the following commodities in the table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fluazifop-P-butyl, butyl(R)-2-[4-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenoxy]propanoate, and the free and conjugated forms of the resolved isomer of fluazifop, (R)-2-[4-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenoxy]propanoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluazifop, in or on the commodity.
