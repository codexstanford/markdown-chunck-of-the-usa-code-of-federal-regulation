13.2.1 ICAP analytical detection limits for the sample solutions (based onMethod 6010) are approximately as follows: Sb (32 ng/ml), As (53 ng/ml), Ba (2 ng/ml), Be (0.3 ng/ml), Cd (4 ng/ml), Cr (7 ng/ml), Co (7 ng/ml), Cu (6 ng/ml), Pb (42 ng/ml), Mn (2 ng/ml), Ni (15 ng/ml), P (75 ng/ml), Se (75 ng/ml), Ag (7 ng/ml), Tl (40 ng/ml), and Zn (2 ng/ml). ICP-MS analytical detection limits (based onMethod 6020) are lower generally by a factor of ten or more. Be is lower by a factor of three. The actual sample analytical detection limits are sample dependent and may vary due to the sample matrix.
