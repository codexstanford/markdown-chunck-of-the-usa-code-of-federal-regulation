####### Emission-limiting strategies

are strategies that directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g., emission rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative to a program baseline that are required to be met by affected sources, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce the cost of meeting program requirements.
