####### Types of provisions.

(a)The term "provision" includes all aspects of the regulations in this part. As specified in this section, regulatory provisions include standards, requirements, and prohibitions, along with a variety of other types of provisions.

(1) A standard is a limit on the formulation, components, or characteristics of any fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock, established by regulation under this part. Compliance with or conformance to a standard is a specific type of requirement. Thus, a statement about the requirements of a part or section also applies with respect to the standards in the part or section. Examples of standards include the sulfur per-gallon standards for gasoline and diesel fuel.

(2) While requirements state what someone must do, prohibitions state what someone must not do. Failing to meet any requirement that applies to a person under this part is a prohibited act.

(3) The regulations in this part include provisions that are not standards, requirements, or prohibitions, such as definitions.
