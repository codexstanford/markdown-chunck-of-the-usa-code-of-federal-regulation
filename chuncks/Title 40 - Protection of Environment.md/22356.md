7.1.1 Conduct a QC check on the filter lot prior to the field test to demonstrate that filters are free from contamination or interference by extracting and analyzing a minimum of three filters from each lot as follows. Spike with pre-extraction and pre-extraction filter recovery standards for target compounds to be measured and extract each filter separately with toluene as described in Section 11 of this method. After extraction, remove the filters and the solvent from the filters under clean conditions (a clean nitrogen stream). Analyze the extracts according to the procedures in Section 11 of this method, including adding pre-analysis standard. This filter check analysis must meet the performance requirements in Section 13.1 of this method. Ongoing analysis of LMB can be used to fulfill this check. If criteria are not met for target compounds, repeat with additional filters from the lot or evaluate another lot.
