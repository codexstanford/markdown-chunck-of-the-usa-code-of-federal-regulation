####### § 97.826 Banking and conversion.

(a) A CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance may be banked for future use or transfer in a compliance account or a general account in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Any CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance that is held in a compliance account or a general account will remain in such account unless and until the CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance is deducted or transferred under § 97.811(c) or (d), § 97.823, § 97.824, § 97.825, § 97.827, or § 97.828 or paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

(c) At any time after the allowance transfer deadline for the last control period for which a State NOOzone Season Group 2 trading budget is set forth in § 97.810(a) for a given State and after completion of the procedures under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the Administrator may record a transfer of any CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances held in the compliance account for a source in such State (or Indian country within the borders of such State) to a general account identified or established by the Administrator with the source's designated representative as the authorized account representative and with the owners and operators of the source (as indicated on the certificate of representation for the source) as the persons represented by the authorized account representative. The Administrator will notify the designated representative not less than 15 days before making such a transfer.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, part 52 of this chapter, or any SIP revision approved under § 52.38(b)(8) or (9) of this chapter:

(1) By August 13, 2021, the Administrator will temporarily suspend acceptance of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowance transfers submitted under § 97.822 and, before resuming acceptance of such transfers, will take the following actions:

(i) The Administrator will determine each of the following values:

(A) The total amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for the control periods in 2017 through 2020 attributable to the States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States), computed as the sum of the State NOOzone Season Group 2 trading budgets under § 97.810(a) for such States for all such control periods plus the product of 1.5 multiplied by the sum of the variability limits under § 97.810(b) for such States for the control period in 2017.

(B) The total tons of NOemissions reported in accordance with §§ 97.806(b) and 97.830 through 97.835 for all CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 units at CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 sources in the States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States) for the control periods in 2017 through 2020.

(C) The full-season CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target, computed as the sum for all States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(v) of this chapter of the variability limits under § 97.1010(b) for such States for the control period in 2022.

(D) A conversion factor, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the remainder of the total amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section minus the total tons of NOemissions determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section divided by the full-season CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section.

(E) The adjusted CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target, computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of the full-season CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of days from June 29, 2021 through September 30, 2021, inclusive, and whose denominator is 153.

(ii) The Administrator will allocate CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to sources in States listed in § 52.38(b)(2)(v) of this chapter (and Indian country within the borders of such States) as follows:

(A) The Administrator will determine for each such source the source's maximum share, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 held in the source's compliance account divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

(B) The Administrator will determine a source allocation scaling factor, computed as the lesser of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of the adjusted CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section divided by the sum for all such sources of the maximum shares under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.

(C) The Administrator will allocate to each such source an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of such source's maximum share under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section multiplied by the source allocation scaling factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

(iii) If the sum for all sources of the allocations under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section is less than the adjusted CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section, the Administrator will allocate CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances for the control period in 2021 to general accounts as follows:

(A) The Administrator will determine for each general account the account's maximum share, computed as the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 held in the account divided by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.

(B) The Administrator will determine a general account allocation scaling factor, computed as the lesser of 1.0000 or the quotient, expressed to four decimal places, of the remainder of the adjusted CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowance bank target determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(E) of this section minus the sum for all sources of the allocations under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section divided by the sum for all general accounts of the maximum shares under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

(C) The Administrator will allocate to each general account an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances computed as the product, rounded to the nearest allowance, of such account's maximum share under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section multiplied by the general account allocation scaling factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.

(iv) For the compliance account of each source, and for each general account, to which an amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances greater than zero is allocated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, respectively:

(A) The Administrator will determine the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances required to be deducted from the account, computed as the product of the amount of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances allocated to the source or general account under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section multiplied by the conversion factor determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section. The Administrator will deduct CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated for control periods before 2021 from the account on a first-in, first-out basis in the order set forth in § 97.824(c)(2)(i) and (ii).

(B) The Administrator will record in the account the allocations of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 3 allowances under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) or (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section and the deductions of CSAPR NOOzone Season Group 2 allowances under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.
