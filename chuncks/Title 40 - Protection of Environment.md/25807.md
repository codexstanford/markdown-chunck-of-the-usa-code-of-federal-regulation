####### Compounds not required to be considered in performance tests or design evaluations.

(6)Compounds that meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), or (a)(6)(iii) of this section are not required to be included in the performance test. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.

(i) Compounds not used or produced by the chemical manufacturing process unit; or

(ii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below 1 part per million by weight; or

(iii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below the lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 part per million by weight. The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte.
