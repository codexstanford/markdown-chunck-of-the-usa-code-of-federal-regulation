####### ยง 1065.366 Interference verification for FTIR analyzers.
######## Procedure.
######### Procedure.
########## Exceptions.

(g)The following exceptions apply:

(1) You may omit this verification if you can show by engineering analysis that for your NOsampling system and your emission calculation procedures, the combined COand HO interference for your NOCLD analyzer always affects your brake-specific NOemission results within no more than +/-1% of the applicable NOstandard. If you certify to a combined emission standard (such as a NO+ NMHC standard), scale your NOresults to the combined standard based on the measured results (after incorporating deterioration factors, if applicable). For example, if your final NO+ NMHC value is half of the emission standard, double the NOresult to estimate the level of NOemissions corresponding to the applicable standard.

(2) You may use a NOCLD analyzer that you determine does not meet this verification, as long as you try to correct the problem and the measurement deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to show that engines comply with all applicable emission standards.
