######## Default electrical load

means an electrical load equal to 5 percent of the maximum sustainable electrical output (megawatts), as defined in section 6.5.2.1(a)(1) of Appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, of an affected EGU that is in startup or shutdown mode. For monitored common stack configurations, the default electrical load is 5 percent of the combined maximum sustainable electrical load of the EGUs that are in startup or shutdown mode during an hour in which the electrical load for all operating EGUs is zero. The default electrical load is used to calculate the electrical output-based emission rate (lb/MWh or lb/GWh, as applicable) for any startup or shutdown hour in which the actual electrical load is zero. The default electrical load is not used for EGUs required to make heat input-based emission rate (lb/MMBtu or lb/TBtu, as applicable) calculations. For the purposes of this subpart, the default electrical load is not considered to be a substitute data value.
