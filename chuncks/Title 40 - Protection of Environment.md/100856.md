####### Power category

means a specific range of maximum engine power that defines the applicability of standards. For example, references to the 56-130 kW power category and 56 &#x2264;kW <130 include all engines with maximum engine power at or above 56 kW but below 130 kW. Also references to 56-560 kW power categories or 56 &#x2264;kW &#x2264;560 include all engines with maximum engine power at or above 56 kW but at or below 560 kW, even though these engines span multiple power categories. Note that in some cases, FEL caps are based on a subset of a power category. The power categories are defined as follows:

(1) Engines with maximum power below 19 kW.

(2) Engines with maximum power at or above 19 kW but below 56 kW.

(3) Engines with maximum power at or above 56 kW but below 130 kW.

(4) Engines with maximum power at or above 130 kW but at or below 560 kW.

(5) Engines with maximum power above 560 kW.
