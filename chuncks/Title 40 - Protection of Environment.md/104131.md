#### PART 1068 - GENERAL COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS FOR HIGHWAY, STATIONARY, AND NONROAD PROGRAMS
##### Subpart D - Imports
###### ยง 1068.310 Exclusions for imported engines/equipment.
####### Stationary engines.

(b)The definition of nonroad engine in ยง 1068.30 does not include certain engines used in stationary applications. Such engines (and equipment containing such engines) may be subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 60. Engines that are excluded from the definition of nonroad engine in this part and are not required to be certified to standards under 40 CFR part 60 are not subject to the restrictions on imports in ยง 1068.301(b), but only if they are properly labeled and there is clear and convincing evidence that each engine will be used in a stationary application (see paragraph (2)(iii) of the definition of "Nonroad engine"). Section 1068.101 restricts the use of stationary engines for non-stationary purposes unless they are certified under 40 CFR part 60 to the same standards that would apply to nonroad engines for the same model year.
