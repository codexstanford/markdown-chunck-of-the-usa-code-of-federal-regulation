####### Acetal resins production

means the production of homopolymers and/or copolymers of alternating oxymethylene units. Acetal resins are also known as polyoxymethylenes, polyacetals, and aldehyde resins. Acetal resins are generally produced by polymerizing formaldehyde (HCHO) with the methylene functional group (CH) and are characterized by repeating oxymethylene units (CHO) in the polymer backbone.
