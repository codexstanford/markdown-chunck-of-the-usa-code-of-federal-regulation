This method describes the sampling and analytical procedures used to measure selected PCDD and PCDF in stationary sources when required in an applicable subpart. This method also describes how the same sampling and analysis technology can be used to measure selected PCB and PAH from stationary source in combination or as each individual compound class when required in an applicable subpart. However, Method 23 incorporates by reference some of the specifications (equipment and supplies) and procedures (sampling and analytical) from other methods in this part that are essential to conducting Method 23. To obtain reliable samples, source sampling teams should be trained and experienced with the following additional EPA test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, Method 4, and Method 5 of Appendices A-1, A-2, and A-3 to 40 CFR part 60. Laboratory analysis teams should be trained and experienced with Method 1668C (found at:and Method 1613B of 40 CFR part 136 Appendix A and have a working knowledge of isotope dilution and the use of high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS).
