######### Deductions for compliance.

(b)Following the recordation, in accordance with § 97.261, of CAIR SOallowance transfers submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance account CAIR SOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine whether the source meets the CAIR SOemissions limitation for the control period as follows:

(1) For a CAIR SOsource subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation, the Administrator will, in the following order:

(i) Deduct the amount of CAIR SOallowances, available under paragraph (a) of this section and not issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288, that is required under §§ 73.35(b) and (c) of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR SOallowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will be treated as satisfying the requirements of §§ 73.35(b) and (c) of this chapter.

(ii) Deduct the amount of CAIR SOallowances, not issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288, that is required under §§ 73.35(d) and 77.5 of this part. If there are sufficient CAIR SOallowances to complete this deduction, the deduction will be treated as satisfying the requirements of §§ 73.35(d) and 77.5 of this chapter.

(iii) Treating the CAIR SOallowances deducted under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as also being deducted under this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), deduct CAIR SOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288) in order to determine whether the source meets the CAIR SOemissions limitation for the control period, as follows:

(A) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SOallowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, from all CAIR SOunits at the source for the control period; or

(B) If there are insufficient CAIR SOallowances to complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, until no more CAIR SOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288) remain in the compliance account.

(2) For a CAIR SOsource not subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation, the Administrator will deduct CAIR SOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288) in order to determine whether the source meets the CAIR SOemissions limitation for the control period, as follows:

(i) Until the tonnage equivalent of the CAIR SOallowances deducted equals, or exceeds in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the number of tons of total sulfur dioxide emissions, determined in accordance with subpart HHH of this part, from all CAIR SOunits at the source for the control period; or

(ii) If there are insufficient CAIR SOallowances to complete the deductions in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, until no more CAIR SOallowances available under paragraph (a) of this section (including any issued by a permitting authority under § 97.288) remain in the compliance account.
