(iii) For each of the three determinations calculate the Kas the ratio of the molar concentration of the test substance in-octanol to the molar concentration in water. Also calculate and report the mean Kand its standard deviation. Values of Kshall be reported as their logarithms (logK).

(iv) Report the temperature (+/-0.05 &#xB0;C) at which the generator column was controlled during the test.

(v) For each reference compound report the individual values of logKand the average of the two runs.

(vi) For compounds that decompose at a rate such that a precise value for the solubility cannot be obtained, provide a statement to that effect.
