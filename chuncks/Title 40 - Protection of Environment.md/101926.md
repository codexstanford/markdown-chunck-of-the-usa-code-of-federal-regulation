(c)Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1048. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers who use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new engines and vehicles; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1048 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1051 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under this part 1051 or under 40 CFR part 85 or 1068.505.
