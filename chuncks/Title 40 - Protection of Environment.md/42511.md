###### ยง 75.15 [Reserved]
######## e.g.,,e.g.,

(2) Provided that the products of combustion are well-mixed, install, certify, operate, and maintain a NOcontinuous emission monitoring system in one stack or duct from the affected unit and record the monitored value as the NOemission rate for the unit. The owner or operator shall account for NOemissions from the unit during all times when the unit combusts fuel. Therefore, this option shall not be used if the monitored stack or duct can be bypassed (by using dampers). Follow the procedure in ยง 75.17(d) for units with bypass stacks. Further, this option shall not be used unless the monitored NOemission rate truly represents the NOemissions discharged to the atmosphere (the option is disallowed if there are any additional NOemission controls downstream of the monitored location).
