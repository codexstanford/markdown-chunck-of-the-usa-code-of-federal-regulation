####### Emission estimation procedures.

(i)Owners or operators shall determine uncontrolled emissions of HAP using measurements and/or calculations for each batch emission episode within each unit operation according to the engineering evaluation methodology in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (H) of this section. Except where variations are noted, individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems shall be determined by the following methods: If the components are miscible in one another, use Raoult's law to calculate the partial pressures; if the solution is a dilute aqueous mixture, use Henry's law to calculate partial pressures; if Raoult's law or Henry's law are not appropriate or available, use experimentally obtained activity coefficients or models such as the group-contribution models, to predict activity coefficients, or assume the components of the system behave independently and use the summation of all vapor pressures from the HAP as the total HAP partial pressure. Chemical property data can be obtained from standard reference texts.
