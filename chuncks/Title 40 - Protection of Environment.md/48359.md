###### § 93.122 Procedures for determining regional transportation-related emissions.
####### Reliance on previous regional emissions analysis.
######## CO hot-spot analysis.

(a)(1) The demonstrations required by § 93.116 ("Localized CO, PM, and PMviolations") must be based on quantitative analysis using the applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in 40 CFR part 51, Appendix W (Guideline on Air Quality Models). These procedures shall be used in the following cases, unless different procedures developed through the interagency consultation process required in § 93.105 and approved by the EPA Regional Administrator are used:

(i) For projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites which are identified in the applicable implementation plan as sites of violation or possible violation;

(ii) For projects affecting intersections that are at Level-of-Service D, E, or F, or those that will change to Level-of-Service D, E, or F because of increased traffic volumes related to the project;

(iii) For any project affecting one or more of the top three intersections in the nonattainment or maintenance area with highest traffic volumes, as identified in the applicable implementation plan; and

(iv) For any project affecting one or more of the top three intersections in the nonattainment or maintenance area with the worst level of service, as identified in the applicable implementation plan.

(2) In cases other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the demonstrations required by § 93.116 may be based on either:

(i) Quantitative methods that represent reasonable and common professional practice; or

(ii) A qualitative consideration of local factors, if this can provide a clear demonstration that the requirements of § 93.116 are met.

(3) DOT, in consultation with EPA, may also choose to make a categorical hot-spot finding that (93.116(a) is met without further hot-spot analysis for any project described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section based on appropriate modeling. DOT, in consultation with EPA, may also consider the current air quality circumstances of a given CO nonattainment or maintenance area in categorical hot-spot findings for applicable FHWA or FTA projects.
