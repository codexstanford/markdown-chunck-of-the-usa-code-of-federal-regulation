##### Subpart PPPP - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Plastic Parts and Products
###### Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
####### ยง 63.4541 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## EPA Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60).,see

(2)For coatings, you may use EPA Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. As an alternative to using EPA Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (Reapproved 2015)(incorporated by reference,ยง 63.14). For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may use the alternative method contained in appendix A to this subpart, rather than EPA Method 24. You may use the volatile fraction that is emitted, as measured by the alternative method in appendix A to this subpart, as a substitute for the mass fraction of organic HAP.
