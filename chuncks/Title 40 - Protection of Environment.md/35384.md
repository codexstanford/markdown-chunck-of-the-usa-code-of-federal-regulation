## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart QQQQ - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Surface Coating of Wood Building Products
###### Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
####### ยง 63.4741 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## ASTM Method D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014) or D6093-97 (Reapproved 2016).

(1)You may use ASTM Method D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014), "Standard Test Method for Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings" (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14), or D6093-97 (Reapproved 2016), "Standard Test Method for Percent Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings Using a Helium Gas Pycnometer" (incorporated by reference, see ยง 63.14), to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids. If these values cannot be determined using these methods, the owner operator may submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.
