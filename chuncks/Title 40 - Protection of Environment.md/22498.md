8.2.9.2 Pour all the liquid from the two permanganate impingers into a graduated cylinder and measure the volume to within 0.5 ml. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the sampled flue gas. Place this acidic KMnOsolution into Container No. 5B. Using a total of exactly 100 ml of fresh acidified KMnOsolution for all rinses (approximately 33 ml per rinse), rinse the two permanganate impingers and connecting glassware a minimum of three times. Pour the rinses into Container No. 5B, carefully assuring transfer of all loose precipitated materials from the two impingers. Similarly, using 100 ml total of water, rinse the permanganate impingers and connecting glass a minimum of three times, and pour the rinses into Container 5B, carefully assuring transfer of any loose precipitated material. Mark the height of the fluid level, and clearly label the contents. Read thein section 7.3.2.
