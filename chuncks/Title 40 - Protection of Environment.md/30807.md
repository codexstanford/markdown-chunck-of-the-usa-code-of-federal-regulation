() The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across each series of treatment processes. For each series of treatment processes, inlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured either where the wastewater enters the first treatment process in a series of treatment processes, or prior to the first treatment process as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section. For each series of treatment processes, outlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured where the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the series of treatment processes, except when the last treatment process is an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this section. When the last treatment process is either an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this section, inlet and outlet concentrations and flow rates shall be measured at the inlet and outlet to the series of treatment processes prior to the biological treatment process and at the inlet to the biological treatment process, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(ii) of this section. The mass flow rate destroyed in the biological treatment process for which compliance is demonstrated using paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this section shall be added to the mass flow rate removed or destroyed in the series of treatment units before the biological treatment unit. This sum shall be used to calculate the overall control efficiency.
