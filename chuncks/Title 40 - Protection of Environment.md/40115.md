###### Sampling Probe.

6.1Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, prevent adsorption of analytes, and to transport analytes to the infrared gas cell. Special materials or configurations may be required in some applications. For instance, high stack sample temperatures may require special steel or cooling the probe. For very high moisture sources it may be desirable to use a dilution probe.
