####### Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and lean NO,catalyst monitoring,General.

(6)-(i)The OBD system must monitor the SCR and/or the lean NOconverting catalyst(s) for proper conversion capability. For engines equipped with SCR systems or other catalyst systems that use an active/intrusive reductant injection (e.g., active lean NOcatalysts that use diesel fuel post-injection or in-exhaust injection), the OBD system must monitor the active/intrusive reductant injection system for proper performance. The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors, heaters, pumps) in the active/intrusive reductant injection system must be monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component requirements in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(6), each catalyst that converts NOmust be monitored either individually or in combination with others.
