(5)An owner or operator of the incinerator may submit evidence to the Regional Administrator or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery that operation of the incinerator will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment from PCBs, when one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section are not met. On the basis of such evidence and any other available information, EPA may, in its discretion, find that any requirement of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is not necessary to protect against such a risk, and may waive the requirements in any approval for that incinerator.
