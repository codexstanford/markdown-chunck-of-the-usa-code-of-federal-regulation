###### Calculate the difference between the measured HCl concentration with and without interferents for each interference gas (or mixture) for your CEMS as:

12.2

Calculate the total percent interference as:

12.2.1 Calculate the equivalent concentration Cusing Equation 4:

12.4.1 Calculate the equivalent concentration Cusing Equation 4:

12.4.2 Calculate the average native concentration before and after each calibration check measurement as:

12.4.3 Calculate the ME or CD at concentration i for an IP-CEM as:

12.4.4 Calculate the zero CD as a percent of span for an IP-CEMS as:

12.6.1 Determine the CEMS final integrated minute average pollutant concentration or emission rate for each RM test period. Consider system RT, if important, and confirm that the results have been corrected to the same moisture, temperature and diluent concentration basis.
