######## k,,E,k,T,,E

(e) Using the data pairs of temperature and thermal aging rate constant,from paragraph (c)(2) of this section, determine the thermal reactivity coefficient,, by performing a regression analysis of the natural log ofversus the inverse of temperature,in Kelvin. Determinefrom the slope of the resulting line using the following equation:
