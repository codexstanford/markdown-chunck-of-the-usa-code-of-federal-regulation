####### Revisions to the plan.

(4)Based on the results of a determination made under ยง 63.1108(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section:

(i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source that has occurred; or

(ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or

(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or

(iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in ยง 63.1108(a)(5).
