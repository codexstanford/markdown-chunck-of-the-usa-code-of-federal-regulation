####### Positive displacement pump.

(3)The Positive Displacement Pump-Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS), Figure B94-1 satisfies the first condition by metering at a constant temperature and pressure through the pump. The total volume is measured by counting the revolutions made by the calibrated positive displacement pump. The proportional samples for the bag sample, and for methanol-fueled vehicles, the methanol sample (Figure B94-2) and the formaldehyde sample (Figure B94-3), are achieved by sampling at a constant flow rate. For methanol-fueled vehicles, the sample lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent condensation. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more than 5 &#xB0;F (3 &#xB0;C) above the maximum dew point of the sample, but below 250 &#xB0;F (121 &#xB0;C). (Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated with methanol.)
