####### Permit renewal and expiration.

(c)(1) (i) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected State review, and EPA review (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) that apply to initial permit issuance.

(ii) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with paragraph (b) of this section and § 71.5(a)(1)(iii).

(2) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if the permitting authority fails to act in a timely way on permit renewal, EPA may invoke its authority under section 505(e) of the Act to terminate or revoke and reissue the permit.

(3) If a timely and complete application for a permit renewal is submitted, consistent with § 71.5(a)(2), but the permitting authority has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous part 70 or 71 permit, then the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) may extend beyond the original permit term until renewal; or all the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) shall remain in effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.
