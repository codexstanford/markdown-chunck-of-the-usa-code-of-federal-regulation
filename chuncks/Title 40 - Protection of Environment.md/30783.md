####### Compliance with wastewater provisions,Determining annual average concentration and annual load.

(e)-(1)To determine the annual average concentration and annual load of partially soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds in a wastewater stream, as required by ยง 63.1256(a)(1), an owner or operator shall comply with the provisions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. A wastewater stream is exempt from the requirements of ยง 63.1256(a)(2) if the owner or operator determines the annual average concentration and annual load are below all of the applicability cutoffs specified in ยง 63.1256(a)(1)(i)(A) through (D). For annual average concentration, only initial rinses are included. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
