####### Analyzers with H,O compensation sampling downstream of a sample dryer.

(h)You may omit humidifying the span gas as described in this paragraph (h). If an analyzer compensates only for HO, you may apply the requirements of ยง 1065.308 instead of the requirements of this section. You may omit humidifying the span gas if you meet the following conditions:

(1) The analyzer is located downstream of a sample dryer.

(2) The maximum value for HO mole fraction downstream of the dryer must be less than or equal to 0.010. Verify this during each sample dryer verification according to ยง 1065.342.
