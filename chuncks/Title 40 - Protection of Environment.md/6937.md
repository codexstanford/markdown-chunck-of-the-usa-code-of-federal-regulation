a. Models for PMare needed to assess the adequacy of a proposed strategy for meeting the annual and 24-hour PMNAAQS. Modeling primary and secondary PMcan be a multi-faceted and complex problem, especially for secondary components of PMsuch as sulfates and nitrates. Control agencies with jurisdiction over areas with secondary PMproblems should use models that integrate chemical and physical processes important in the formation, decay, and transport of these species (photochemical grid models). Suitability of a modeling approach or mix of modeling approaches for a given application requires technical judgment as well as professional experience in choice of models, use of the model(s) in an attainment test, development of emissions and meteorological inputs to the model, and selection of days to model. Guidance on the use of models and other analyses for demonstrating attainment of the air quality goals for PMis available.Users should consult with the appropriate reviewing authority (paragraph 3.0(b)) to ensure the most current modeling guidance is applied.
