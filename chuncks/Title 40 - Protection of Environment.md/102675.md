####### ยง 1065.266 Fourier transform infrared analyzer.
######## Component requirements.,https://www.epa.gov/emc/method-320-vapor-phase-organic-and-inorganic-emissions-extractive-ftir

(b)We recommend that you use an FTIR analyzer that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your FTIR-based system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307. Use appropriate analytical procedures for interpretation of infrared spectra. For example, EPA Test Method 320 (see) and ASTM D6348 (incorporated by reference in ยง 1065.1010) are considered valid methods for spectral interpretation. You must use heated FTIR analyzers that maintain all surfaces that are exposed to emissions at a temperature of (110 to 202) &#xB0;C.
