###### 12.2 Individual Compound RRF for Each Calibration Level i.

Equation 23-1 for the response factor of each target native compound relative to its labeled pre-extraction standard analog includes the integrated ion current of both the primary and secondary m/z values for each compound in the calibration standard, excluding PAH, which use only primary m/z values. Use Equation 23-2 to calculate the RRF for pre-extraction standard.

the units for Qand Qin Eq. 23-1 and the units for Qand Qin Equation 23-2 must be the same.
