###### ยง 281.33 Release detection.
####### Phase-in of requirements.

(b)Release detection requirements must, at a minimum, be applied at all UST systems immediately, except for UST systems previously deferred under ยง 280.10(a)(1). Release detection requirements must, at a minimum, be scheduled to be applied to those previously deferred UST systems as follows:

(1) Immediately when a new previously deferred UST system is installed; and

(2) For any previously deferred UST system within three years of the effective date of its state requirements. This provision would not apply, however, to states that did not defer these UST systems and already had, prior to the effective date of this provision, existing release detection requirements with specified compliance periods for these types of UST systems.
