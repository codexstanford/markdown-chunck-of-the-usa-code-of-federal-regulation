####### 10.1 Pre-Sampling Calibration.

Conduct the following protocol once for each nominal range to be used on each EC cell before performing a stack gas sampling run on each field sampling day. Repeat the calibration if you replace an EC cell before completing all of the sampling runs. There is no prescribed order for calibration of the EC cells; however, each cell must complete the measurement data phase during calibration. Assemble the measurement system by following the manufacturer's recommended protocols including for preparing and preconditioning the EC cell. Assure the measurement system has no leaks and verify the gas scrubbing agent is not depleted. Use Figure 1 to record all data.
