####### Effect of compliance with new source performance standards.

(d)(The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to existing sources which modify their pollution control facilities or construct new pollution control facilities and achieve performance standards, but which are neither new sources or new dischargers or otherwise do not meet the requirements of this paragraph.)

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any new discharger, the construction of which commenced after October 18, 1972, or new source which meets the applicable promulgated new source performance standards before the commencement of discharge, may not be subject to any more stringent new source performance standards or to any more stringent technology-based standards under section 301(b)(2) of CWA for the soonest ending of the following periods:

(i) Ten years from the date that construction is completed;

(ii) Ten years from the date the source begins to discharge process or other nonconstruction related wastewater; or

(iii) The period of depreciation or amortization of the facility for the purposes of section 167 or 169 (or both) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

(2) The protection from more stringent standards of performance afforded by paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to:

(i) Additional or more stringent permit conditions which are not technology based; for example, conditions based on water quality standards, or toxic effluent standards or prohibitions under section 307(a) of CWA; or

(ii) Additional permit conditions in accordance with ยง 125.3 controlling toxic pollutants or hazardous substances which are not controlled by new source performance standards. This includes permit conditions controlling pollutants other than those identified as toxic pollutants or hazardous substances when control of these pollutants has been specifically identified as the method to control the toxic pollutants or hazardous substances.

(3) When an NPDES permit issued to a source with a "protection period" under paragraph (d)(1) of this section will expire on or after the expiration of the protection period, that permit shall require the owner or operator of the source to comply with the requirements of section 301 and any other then applicable requirements of CWA immediately upon the expiration of the protection period. No additional period for achieving compliance with these requirements may be allowed except when necessary to achieve compliance with requirements promulgated less than 3 years before the expiration of the protection period.

(4) The owner or operator of a new source, a new discharger which commenced discharge after August 13, 1979, or a recommencing discharger shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet the conditions of its permits before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), the owner or operator must meet all permit conditions. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the owner or operator is issued a permit containing a compliance schedule under ยง 122.47(a)(2).

(5) After the effective date of new source performance standards, it shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate the source in violation of those standards applicable to the source.
