####### Fleet average cold temperature NMHC standard

means, for light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles, an NMHC cold temperature standard imposed over an individual manufacturer's total 50-State U.S. sales (or a fraction of total U.S. sales during phase-in years), as "U.S. sales" is defined to include all national sales, including points-of-first sale in California, of a given model year. Manufacturers determine their compliance with such a standard by averaging, on a sales-weighted basis, the individual NMHC "Family Emission Limits" (FEL-as defined in this subpart) to which light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles were certified and sold for that model year.
