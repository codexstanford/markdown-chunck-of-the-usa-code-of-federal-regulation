####### Continuous emission monitor.

(x)As an alternative to the parameters specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (ix) of this section, an owner or operator may monitor and record the outlet HAP concentration or both the outlet TOC concentration and outlet hydrogen halide and halogen concentration every 15 minutes during the period in which the control device is functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this subpart. The owner or operator need not monitor the hydrogen halide and halogen concentration if, based on process knowledge, the owner or operator determines that the emission stream does not contain hydrogen halides or halogens. The HAP or TOC monitor must meet the requirements of Performance Specification 8 or 9 of appendix B of part 60 and must be installed, calibrated, and maintained, according to ยง 63.8. As part of the QA/QC Plan, calibration of the device must include, at a minimum, quarterly cylinder gas audits.
