####### Secondary air system malfunction criteria.

(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the OBD system must detect a secondary air system malfunction prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified air flow during normal operation that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).

(B) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the OBD system must detect a secondary air system malfunction prior to an increase from the manufacturer's specified air flow during normal operation that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).

(C) For engines in which no deterioration or failure of the secondary air system would result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when no detectable amount of air flow is delivered by the secondary air system during normal operation.
