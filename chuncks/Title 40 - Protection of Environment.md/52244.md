###### Appendix A to Subpart L of Part 98 - Mass Balance Method for Fluorinated Gas Production
####### Mass balance method.

(b)Before using the mass balance approach to estimate your fluorinated GHG emissions from a process, you must ensure that the process and the equipment and methods used to measure it meet either the error limits described in this paragraph and calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the requirements specified in paragraph ยง 98.124(b)(8). If you choose to calculate the error limits, you must estimate the absolute and relative errors associated with using the mass balance approach on that process using Equations L-1 through L-4 of this section in conjunction with Equations L-5 through L-10 of this section. You may use the mass-balance approach to estimate emissions from the process if this calculation results in an absolute error of less than or equal to 3,000 metric tons COe per year or a relative error of less than or equal to 30 percent of the estimated COe fluorinated GHG emissions. If you do not meet either of the error limits or the requirements of paragraph ยง 98.124(b)(8), you must use the emission factor approach detailed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to estimate emissions from the process.
