###### Urban scale

(4)-Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the SOmonitoring network such as identifying trends, and when monitors are sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.
