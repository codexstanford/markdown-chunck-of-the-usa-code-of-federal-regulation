###### ยง 350.11 Review of claim.
####### Determination of sufficiency.

(a)When EPA receives a petition submitted pursuant to ยง 350.15, or if EPA initiates a determination of the validity of a trade secrecy claim for chemical identity, and EPA has made a determination, as required in paragraph (d)(1) of ยง 350.9, then EPA shall determine whether the submitter has presented sufficient support for its claim of trade secrecy in its substantiation. EPA must make such a determination within 30 days of receipt of a petition. A claim of trade secrecy for chemical identity will be considered sufficient if, assuming all of the information presented in the substantiation is true, this supporting information could support a valid claim of trade secrecy. A claim is sufficient if it meets the criteria set forth in ยง 350.13.
