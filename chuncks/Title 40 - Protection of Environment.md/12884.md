May 20, 1999, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board, AS 99-4, effective May 20, 1999.

(155) On May 21, 1999, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency submitted a temporary, site-specific revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO) for the Central Illinois Light Company's E.D. Edwards Generating Station in Peoria County, Illinois (CILCO Edwards). The SIP revision took the form of an April 15, 1999, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board (PCB 99-80, Variance-Air). In this Opinion and Order, the IPCB granted CILCO Edwards a variance from 35 Illinois Administrative Code 214.141, and provided for a relaxation in the fuel quality limit for one of the facility's three boilers, but added an overall fuel quality limit and retained an overall SOemissions cap for the three CILCO Edwards boilers. The variance will expire on February 28, 2002, unless CILCO applies to Illinois for a permanent SIP revision.
