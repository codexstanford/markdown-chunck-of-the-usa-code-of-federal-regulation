####### Compliance determining method.

(ii)For the limits referenced in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the compliance determining methods specified in section 4(B) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit shall be followed except when the HS concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream exceeds 1200 ppmv as measured by the HS CEMS required by section 6(B)(3) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit (the HS CEMS.) When such value is exceeded, the following compliance monitoring method shall be employed:

(A) ExxonMobil shall measure the HS concentration in the refinery fuel gas according to the procedures in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section and calculate the emissions according to the equations in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

(B) Within four (4) hours after the HS CEMS measures an HS concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream greater than 1200 ppmv, ExxonMobil shall initiate sampling of the refinery fuel gas stream at the fuel header on a once-per-hour frequency using length-of-stain detector tubes pursuant to ASTM Method D4810-06, "Standard Test Method for Hydrogen Sulfide in Natural Gas Using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes" (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) with the appropriate sample tube range. If the results exceed the tube's range, another tube of a higher range must be used until results are in the tube's range. ExxonMobil shall continue to use the length-of-stain detector tube method at this frequency until the HS CEMS measures an HS concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream equal to or less than 1200 ppmv continuously over a 3-hour period.

(C) When the length-of-stain detector tube method is required, SOemissions from refinery fuel gas combustion shall be calculated as follows: the Hourly emissions shall be calculated using equation 1, 3-hour emissions shall be calculated using equation 2, and the Daily emissions shall be calculated using equation 3.
