####### Test Procedures and Criteria

1.

a. Set up test system in accordance with the circuit and equipment per Figure 1 with OE distributor cap and/or rotor. Connect the primary to a 14 +/-.5V DC regulated power supply.

b. Record open circuit output voltage (M-3) at 300 and 500 distributor rpm and at intervals of 500 distributor rpm up to the maximum speed of the intended application.

c. Insert the intended replacement part(s) in the system and repeat step b. above under identical test conditions.

d. Subject the intended replacement part to the following thermal sequence through five complete cycles:

1. 12 hours at -40 &#xB0;C (-40 &#xB0;F)

2. 2 hours at room temperature

3. 4 hours at 100 &#xB0;C (212 &#xB0;F)

4. 2 hours at room temperature.

e. Repeat step b. above with the replacement part(s).

f. The output voltages measured with the replacement part(s) in the system must be at least 90% of the output voltage with the OE cap and/or rotor.
