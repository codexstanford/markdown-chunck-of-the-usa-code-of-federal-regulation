###### Vapor migration potential.

5.2.1.1.2.4Evaluate this factor for each area of subsurface contamination as follows:

- If the depth to contamination (see section 5.2.1.1.2.2) is 10 feet or less, assign a value of 25.

- Assign a value for vapor migration potential to each of the gaseous hazardous substances associated with the area of subsurface contamination (see section 2.2.2) as follows:

- Assign a value for vapor migration potential to each area of subsurface contamination as follows:

Enter this value in Table 5-11.
