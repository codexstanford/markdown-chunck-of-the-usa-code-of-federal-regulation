####### Associated gas venting or flaring

means the venting or flaring of natural gas which originates at wellheads that also produce hydrocarbon liquids and occurs either in a discrete gaseous phase at the wellhead or is released from the liquid hydrocarbon phase by separation. This does not include venting or flaring resulting from activities that are reported elsewhere, including tank venting, well completions, and well workovers.
