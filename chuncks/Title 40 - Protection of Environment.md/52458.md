####### Centrifugal compressor venting.

(o)If you are required to report emissions from centrifugal compressor venting as specified in ยง 98.232(d)(2), (e)(2), (f)(2), (g)(2), and (h)(2), you must conduct volumetric emission measurements specified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section using methods specified in paragraphs (o)(2) through (5) of this section; perform calculations specified in paragraphs (o)(6) through (9) of this section; and calculate CHand COmass emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(11) of this section. If emissions from a compressor source are routed to a flare, paragraphs (o)(1) through (11) do not apply and instead you must calculate CH, CO, and NO emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(12) of this section. If emissions from a compressor source are captured for fuel use or are routed to a thermal oxidizer, paragraphs (o)(1) through (12) do not apply and instead you must calculate and report emissions as specified in subpart C of this part. If emissions from a compressor source are routed to vapor recovery, paragraphs (o)(1) through (12) do not apply. If you are required to report emissions from centrifugal compressor venting at an onshore petroleum and natural gas production facility as specified in ยง 98.232(c)(19) or an onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facility as specified in ยง 98.232(j)(8), you must calculate volumetric emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(10); and calculate CHand COmass emissions as specified in paragraph (o)(11).
