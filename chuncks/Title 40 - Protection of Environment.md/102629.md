######## Torque.

(2)You may use a variety of methods to determine engine torque. As needed, and based on good engineering judgment, compensate for torque induced by the inertia of accelerating and decelerating components connected to the flywheel, such as the drive shaft and dynamometer rotor. Use any of the following methods to determine engine torque:

(i) Measure torque by mounting a strain gage or similar instrument in-line between the engine and dynamometer.

(ii) Measure torque by mounting a strain gage or similar instrument on a lever arm connected to the dynamometer housing.

(iii) Calculate torque from internal dynamometer signals, such as armature current, as long as you calibrate this measurement as described in ยง 1065.310.
