####### MWC unit capacity

(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculatingas defined under ยง 60.51a:

(1) For MWC units capable of combusting MSW continuously for a 24-hour period, MWC unit capacity, in megagrams per day (tons per day) of MSW combusted, shall be calculated based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum design charging rate. The design heating values under paragraph (j)(4) of this section shall be used in calculating the design charging rate.

(2) For batch MWC units, MWC unit capacity, in megagrams per day (tons per day) of MSW combusted, shall be calculated as the maximum design amount of MSW that can be charged per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period. The maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period is calculated as 24 hours divided by the design number of hours required to process one batch of MSW, and may include fractional batches.The design heating values under paragraph (j)(4) of this section shall be used in calculating the MWC unit capacity in megagrams per day (tons per day) of MSW.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) The MWC unit capacity shall be calculated using a design heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound) for all MSW.
