######## Unit with a main stack and a bypass stack that exhausts to the atmosphere independent of the main stack.

(4)If the exhaust configuration of an affected unit consists of a main stack and a bypass stack, you shall install CEMS on both the main stack and the bypass stack. If it is not feasible to certify and quality-assure the data from a monitoring system on the bypass stack, you shall:

(i) Route the exhaust from the bypass through the main stack and its monitoring so that bypass emissions are measured; or

(ii) Install a CEMS only on the main stack and count hours that the bypass stack is in use as hours of deviation from the monitoring requirements.
