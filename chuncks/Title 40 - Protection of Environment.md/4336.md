###### Sample Preparation.

11.1Remove the samples from the shipping container. If the shipment period exceeded 12 hours from the completion of sampling, verify that the temperature is below 10 &#xB0;C. Also, compare the solution level to the temporary level mark on the absorber. If either the temperature is above 10 &#xB0;C or there was significant loss (more than 10 mL) of the sample during shipping, make an appropriate notation in the record and invalidate the sample. Prepare the samples for analysis as follows:

1. For 30-minute or 1-hour samples: Quantitatively transfer the entire 10 mL amount of absorbing solution to a 25-mL volumetric flask and rinse with a small amount (<5 mL) of distilled water.

2. For 24-hour samples: If the volume of the sample is less than the original 50-mL volume (permanent mark on the absorber), adjust the volume back to the original volume with distilled water to compensate for water lost to evaporation during sampling. If the final volume is greater than the original volume, the volume must be measured using a graduated cylinder. To analyze, pipet 10 mL of the solution into a 25-mL volumetric flask.
