####### Notification due to a disturbance to a known or potential service line containing lead.

(f)(1) Water systems that cause disturbance to a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line that results in the water to an individual service line being shut off or bypassed, such as operating a valve on a service line or meter setter, and without conducting a partial or full lead service line replacement, must provide the persons served by the water system at the service connection with information about the potential for elevated lead levels in drinking water as a result of the disturbance as well as instructions for a flushing procedure to remove particulate lead. The water system must comply with the requirements in this paragraph (f)(1) before the affected service line is returned to service.

(2) If the disturbance of a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line results from the replacement of an inline water meter, a water meter setter, or gooseneck, pigtail, or connector, the water system must provide the person served by the water system at the service connection with information about the potential for elevated lead levels in drinking water as a result of the disturbance, public education materials that meet the content requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, a pitcher filter or point-of-use device certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, instructions to use the filter, and six months of filter replacement cartridges. The water system must comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f)(2) before the affected service line is returned to service.

(3) A water system that conducts a partial or full lead service line replacement must follow procedures in accordance with the requirements in ยง 141.84(d)(1)(i) through (iv) and (e)(1)(i) through (iv), respectively.
