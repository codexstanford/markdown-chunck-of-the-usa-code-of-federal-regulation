###### ยง 141.35 Reporting for unregulated contaminant monitoring results.
####### Only one set of results accepted.

(7)If you report more than one set of valid results for the same sampling location and the same sampling event (for example, because you have had more than one laboratory analyze replicate samples collected under ยง 141.40(a)(5), or because you have collected multiple samples during a single monitoring event at the same sampling location), EPA will use the highest of the reported values as the official result.
