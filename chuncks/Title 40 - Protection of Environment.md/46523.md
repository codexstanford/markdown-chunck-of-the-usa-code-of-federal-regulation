() The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, those engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with ยง 86.085-22(e)(1) may be readjusted to the manufacturer's specifications, if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the first test. The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment in accordance with ยง 86.085-22(e)(3)(i). However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter on the engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. Other maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance with ยง 86.088-25. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such location and under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
