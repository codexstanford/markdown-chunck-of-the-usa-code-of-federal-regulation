###### ยง 280.43 Methods of release detection for tanks.
####### Interstitial monitoring.

(g)Interstitial monitoring between the UST system and a secondary barrier immediately around or beneath it may be used, but only if the system is designed, constructed, and installed to detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product and also meets one of the following requirements:

(1) For double walled UST systems, the sampling or testing method can detect a leak through the inner wall in any portion of the tank that routinely contains product;

(2) For UST systems with a secondary barrier within the excavation zone, the sampling or testing method used can detect a leak between the UST system and the secondary barrier;

(i) The secondary barrier around or beneath the UST system consists of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable (at least 10cm/sec for the regulated substance stored) to direct a leak to the monitoring point and permit its detection;

(ii) The barrier is compatible with the regulated substance stored so that a leak from the UST system will not cause a deterioration of the barrier allowing a release to pass through undetected;

(iii) For cathodically protected tanks, the secondary barrier must be installed so that it does not interfere with the proper operation of the cathodic protection system;

(iv) The groundwater, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method used inoperative so that a release could go undetected for more than 30 days;

(v) The site is assessed to ensure that the secondary barrier is always above the groundwater and not in a 25-year flood plain, unless the barrier and monitoring designs are for use under such conditions; and,

(vi) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering.

(3) For tanks with an internally fitted liner, an automated device can detect a leak between the inner wall of the tank and the liner, and the liner is compatible with the substance stored.
