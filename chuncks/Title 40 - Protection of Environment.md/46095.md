(D) For 20 percent of 2019 model year, 50 percent of 2020 model, and 100 percent of 2021 and later model year diesel engines (percentage based on the manufacturer's projected sales volume of all diesel engines subject to this regulation) equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, the OBD system must monitor continuously for engine misfire under all positive torque engine speed conditions except within the following range: The engine operating region bound by the positive torque line (, engine torque with transmission in neutral) and the two following points: engine speed of 50 percent of maximum engine speed with the engine torque at the positive torque line, and 100 percent of the maximum engine speed with the engine torque at 10 percent of peak torque above the positive torque line. If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator approve the monitoring system nonetheless. In evaluating the manufacturer's request, the Administrator will consider the following factors: The magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (, the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions (, compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be based on the following misfire patterns: Equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and, paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.
