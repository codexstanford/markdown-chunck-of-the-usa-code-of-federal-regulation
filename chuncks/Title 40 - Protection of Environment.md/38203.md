######## Dry sorbent injection

(DSI) means an add-on air pollution control system in which sorbent (e.g., conventional activated carbon, brominated activated carbon, Trona, hydrated lime, sodium carbonate, etc.) is injected into the flue gas steam upstream of a PM control device to react with and neutralize acid gases (such as SOand HCl) or Hg in the exhaust stream forming a dry powder material that may be removed in a primary or secondary PM control device.
