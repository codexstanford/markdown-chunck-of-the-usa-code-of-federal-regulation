(C) Calculate subsequent wvalues after calculating was follows:

(D) Calculate the sum of the weighting factors to verify that they are equal to one.

(vi) For each regulatory cycle determine the average exhaust flow and the average inlet temperature for each key catalyst. Determine the 25th and 90th percentile inlet temperatures for the primary catalyst and the respective associated exhaust flow rate for each data point.
