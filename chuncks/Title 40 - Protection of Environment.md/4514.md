2.4.9.3 Adjustto obtain several other concentrations of NOover the NOrange (at least five evenly spaced points across the remaining scale are suggested). Calculate each NOconcentration using equation (20) and record the corresponding analyzer NOand NOresponses. Plot the analyzer's NOresponses versus the corresponding calculated NOconcentrations and draw or calculate the NOcalibration curve.
