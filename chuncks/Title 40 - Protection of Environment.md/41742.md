####### Draft permits.

(b)(1) Once an application is complete, the Administrator shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.

(2) If the Administrator tentatively decides to deny the permit application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent to deny. A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this subsection. If the Administrator's final decision is that the tentative decision to deny the permit application was incorrect, he or she shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(3) If the Administrator decides to prepare a draft permit, he or she shall prepare a draft permit that contains the permit conditions under ยง 71.25.

(4) All draft permits prepared under this subsection shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment. The Administrator shall give notice of opportunity for a public hearing, issue a final decision and respond to comments. For all early reductions permits, an appeal may be taken under paragraph (l) of this section.
