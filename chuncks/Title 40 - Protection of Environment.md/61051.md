####### N

(2) A tolerance of 5.0 parts per million is established for residues of the insecticide cyromazine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on poultry feed when used as a feed additive only in feed for chicken layer hens and chicken breeder hens at the rate of not more than 0.01 pound of cyromazine per ton of poultry feed for control of flies in manure of treated chicken layer hens and chicken breeder hens, provided the feeding of cyromazine-treated feed must stop at least 3 days (72 hours) before slaughter. If the feed is formulated by any person other than the end user, the formulator must inform the end user, in writing, of the 3-day (72 hours) pre-slaughter interval. Compliance with the tolerance level specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only cyromazine,-cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, in or on the commodity.
