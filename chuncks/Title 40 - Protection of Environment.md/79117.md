####### Release to water.

(iii)Requirements as specified in ยง 721.90 (a)(4) and (b)(4) (N = 9). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง 721.91, the statement that the amount of the substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substance will be treated using primary and secondary wastewater treatment with control of suspended solids, before release, then the amount of the substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 95 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment. These requirements do not apply to the sites specifically exempted in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance.
