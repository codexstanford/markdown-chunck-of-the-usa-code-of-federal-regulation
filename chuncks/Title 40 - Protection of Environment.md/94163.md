####### Characterization of natural gas pipeline systems by PCB concentration in condensate.,1

(iii)(A) Any person disposing of a natural gas pipeline system under paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B) or (b)(5)(ii)(A)() of this section must characterize it for PCB contamination by analyzing organic liquids collected at existing condensate collection points in the natural gas pipeline system. The level of PCB contamination found at a collection point is assumed to extend to the next collection point downstream. If no organic liquids are present, drain free-flowing liquids and collect standard wipe samples according to subpart M of this part. Collect condensate within 72 hours of the final transmission of natural gas through the part of the system to be abandoned or removed. Collect wipe samples after the last transmission of gas through the pipe or during removal from the location it was used to transport natural gas.

(B) PCB concentration of the organic phase of multi-phasic liquids shall be determined in accordance with ยง 761.1(b)(4).
