####### Maryland.

(21)(i) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Maryland Department of the Environment, dated November 3, 1999, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.

(ii) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Maryland Department of the Environment and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 30, 2002, effective April 1, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.

(iii) EPA has granted the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) "up-front" approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the MDE may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM. The MDE may only establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The MDE must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and issue a CAA Title V permit for the Luke Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the MDE has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM.
