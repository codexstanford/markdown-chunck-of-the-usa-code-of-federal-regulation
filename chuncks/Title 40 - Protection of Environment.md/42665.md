###### § 75.37 Missing data procedures for moisture.
####### i.e.

(c) During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification at a particular unit or stack location (, the date and time at which quality-assured data begins to be recorded by a moisture monitoring system at that location), the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for moisture according to § 75.31(b).

(d) Upon completion of the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours following initial certification, the owner or operator shall provide substitute data for moisture as follows:

(1) Unless Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NOemission rate, follow the missing data procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term "moisture percentage" shall apply rather than "SOconcentration;" the term "moisture monitoring system" shall apply rather than the term "SOpollutant concentration monitor;" the term "substitute the lesser of" shall apply rather than "substitute the greater of;" the terms "minimum hourly moisture percentage" and "minimum potential moisture percentage, as determined under section 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part" shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms "maximum hourly SOconcentration" and "maximum potential SOconcentration, as determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part;" and the terms "10th percentile" and "5th percentile" shall apply rather than, respectively, the terms "90th percentile" and "95th percentile" (see Table 1 of § 75.33).

(2) When Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NOemission rate:

(i) Provided that none of the following equations is used to determine SOemissions, COemissions or heat input: Equation F-2, F-14b, F-16, F-17, or F-18 in appendix F to this part, or Equation 19-5 or 19-9 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, use the missing data procedures in § 75.33(b), except that the term "moisture percentage" shall apply rather than "SOconcentration," the term "moisture monitoring system" shall apply rather than "SOpollutant concentration monitor," and the term "maximum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part" shall apply, rather than "maximum potential SOconcentration;" or

(ii) If any of the following equations is used to determine SOemissions, COemissions or heat input: Equation F-2, F-14b, F-16, F-17, or F-18 in appendix F to this part, or Equation 19-5 or 19-9 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, the owner or operator shall petition the Administrator under § 75.66(l) for permission to use an alternative moisture missing data procedure.
