######## Test report.

(2)The following should be included in the report:

(i) Name of the substance, including its purity.

(ii) Temperature of the determination.

(iii) The preliminary estimate of the P and its manner of determination.

(iv) Data on the analytical procedures used in determining concentrations.

(v) The measured concentrations in both phases for each determination. This means that a total of 12 concentrations must be reported.

(vi) The weight of the test substance, the volume of each phase employed in each test vessel, and the total calculated amount of test substance present in each phase after equilibration.

(vii) The calculated values of the P and the mean should be reported for each set of test conditions as should the mean for all determinations. If there is a suggestion of concentration dependency of the P, this should be noted in the report.

(viii) The standard deviation of individual P values about their mean should be reported.

(ix) The mean P from all determinations should also be expressed as its logarithm (base 10).
