###### Level II concentrations.

4.1.3.3.2.2Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the Level I concentrations factor.

Assign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table 4-18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food chain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.

Sum the human food chain population value for each fishery (and portion of a fishery). If this sum is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Assign the resulting value as the Level II concentrations factor value. Enter this value in table 4-1.
