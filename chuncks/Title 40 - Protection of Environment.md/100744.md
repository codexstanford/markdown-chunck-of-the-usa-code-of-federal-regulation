####### Manufacturer reporting to EPA.

(h)Within 90 days after each calendar year, the manufacturer must send an annual report to the Designated Compliance Officer describing the use of AECDs approved under this section. A manufacturer may request an extension if it is impractical to meet this deadline as the result of an emergency situation occurring late in a given calendar year. The annual report must include a description of each emergency situation leading to each AECD activation and copies of the reports submitted by operators (or statements that an operator did not submit a report, to the extent of the manufacturer's knowledge).
