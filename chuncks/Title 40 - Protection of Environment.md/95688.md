####### Data and reporting,Treatment of results.

(c)-(1)(i) If Procedure 1 or 2 were employed in making concentration measurements, use a linear regression analysis with Equation 4 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section to calculate kat 25 &#xB0;C for each pH employed in the hydrolysis experiments. Calculate the coefficient of determination (R) for each rate constant. Use Equation 3 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section to calculate the hydrolysis half-life using k.

(ii) If Procedure 3 was employed in making rate measurements, use the mean initial concentration (C) and the mean concentration of chemical (C) in Equation 4 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section to calculate kfor each pH used in the experiments. Calculate the hydrolysis half-life using kin Equation 3 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section.

(iii) For each set of three concentration replicates, calculate the mean value of C and the standard deviation.

(iv) For test chemicals that are not ionized or protonated between pH 3 and 11, calculate k, k, and kusing Equation 5.
