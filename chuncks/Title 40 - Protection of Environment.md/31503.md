######## Monovent

means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission control device (e. g. positive pressure fabric filter) that extends the length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its length (i. e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.
