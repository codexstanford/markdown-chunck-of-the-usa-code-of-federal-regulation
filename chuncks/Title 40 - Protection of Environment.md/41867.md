####### Expanded uncertainty,e.g.,,+/-

means a measure of uncertainty that defines an interval about the measurement result y within which the value of the measurand Y can be confidently asserted to lie. Although the combined standard uncertainty uis used to express the uncertainty of many measurement results, for some commercial, industrial, and regulatory applications (when health and safety are concerned), what is often required is an expanded uncertainty, suggested symbol U, and is obtained by multiplying u(y) by a coverage factor, suggested symbol k. Thus U = ku(y) and it is confidently believed that Y is greater than or equal to y - U, and is less than or equal to y + U, which is commonly written as Y = yU.
