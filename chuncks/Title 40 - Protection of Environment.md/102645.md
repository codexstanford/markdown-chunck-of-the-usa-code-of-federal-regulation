####### ยง 1065.230 Raw exhaust flow meter.
######## Component requirements.

(b)We recommend that you use a raw-exhaust flow meter that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. This may involve using an ultrasonic flow meter, a subsonic venturi, an averaging Pitot tube, a hot-wire anemometer, or other measurement principle. This would generally not involve a laminar flow element or a thermal-mass meter. Note that your overall system for measuring raw exhaust flow must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307 and the calibration and verifications in ยง 1065.330. Any raw-exhaust meter must be designed to appropriately compensate for changes in the raw exhaust's thermodynamic, fluid, and compositional states.
