####### Generating transient test cycles.

(a)The heavy-duty transient engine cycles for Otto-cycle and diesel engines are listed in appendix I((f) (1), (2) and (3)) to this part. These second-by-second listings represent torque and rpm maneuvers characteristic of heavy-duty engines. Both rpm and torque are normalized (expressed as a percentage of maximum) in these listings.

(1) To unnormalize rpm, use the following equations:

(i) For diesel engines:

(2) Torque is normalized to the maximum torque at the rpm listed with it. Therefore, to unnormalize the torque values in the cycle, the maximum torque curve for the engine in question must be used. The generation of the maximum torque curve is described in 40 CFR part 1065.
