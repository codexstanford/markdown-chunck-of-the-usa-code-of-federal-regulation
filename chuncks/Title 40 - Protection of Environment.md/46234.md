####### Comprehensive component MIL activation and DTC storage.

(vi)(A) Except as provided for in paragraphs (i)(3)(vi)(B) and (i)(3)(vi)(C) of this section, the MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(B) The MIL need not be activated in conjunction with storing a MIL-on DTC for any comprehensive component if: the component or system, when malfunctioning, could not cause engine emissions to increase by 15 percent or more of the applicable FTP standard during any reasonable driving condition; or, the component or system is not used as part of the monitoring strategy for any other system or component that is required to be monitored.

(C) The MIL need not be activated if a malfunction has been detected in the MIL circuit that prevents the MIL from activating (e.g., burned out bulb or light-emitting diode, LED). Nonetheless, the electronic MIL status (see paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section) must be reported as MIL commanded-on and a MIL-on DTC must be stored.
