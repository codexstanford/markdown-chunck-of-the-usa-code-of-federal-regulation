####### Principle of the test method.

(d)The test substance is administered to several groups of experimental animals, one dose being used per group. The animals are observed under carefully standardized conditions with sufficient frequency to ensure the detection and quantification of behavioral and/or neurologic abnormalities, if present. Various functions that could be affected by neurotoxicants are assessed during each observation period. Measurements of motor activity of individual animals are made in an automated device. The animals are perfused and tissue samples from the nervous system are prepared for microscopic examination. The exposure levels at which significant neurotoxic effects are produced are compared to one another and to those levels that produce other toxic effects.
