##### Appendix A to Part 57 - Primary Nonferrous Smelter Order (NSO) Application
###### General.

Use Schedule D.4 to report yearly sustaining capital outlays for maintenance of the smelter's existing productive capability. The applicant should complete Schedule D.4 twice, under two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SOcontrols that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure after January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant equipment and any additional SOcontrols required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so that the smelter will remain open through the horizon period.

Major elements of these outlays should be disclosed, as well as the total of such outlays. Estimates shall be restricted to those items that will be capitalized for tax purposes. These outlays shall primarily be for plant replacement, although outlays for improvements and expansion may be included to the extent that improvements and/or expansion, exclusive of required pollution control outlays, can be justified as economically feasible. Estimates of sustaining capital investments shall exclude any incremental investment for sulfur dioxide emission controls reported in Line 06 of Schedule D.6. Sustaining capital investments in facilities shared with other operating segments shall be allocated in accordance with the instructions given below.

Estimates of sustaining capital shall be compatible with productive capacity and pollution control requirements underlying the operating revenue and cost forecasts incorporated in Schedule D.3.
