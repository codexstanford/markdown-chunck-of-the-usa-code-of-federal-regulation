####### Test substance delivery system.

(v)In flow-through tests, proportional diluters, metering pump systems, or other suitable devices should be used to deliver test chemical to the test chambers. The system shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test chemical in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance delivery system should be checked twice during a test. The 24-hour flow through a test chamber shall be equal to at least 5 times the volume of the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not vary more than 10 percent from any one test chamber to another.
