###### 13.4 Interference Check.

The total interference response (i.e., the sum of the interference responses of all tested gaseous components) must not be greater than 2.50 percent of the calibration span for the analyzer tested. In summing the interferences, use the larger of the absolute values obtained for the interferent tested with and without the pollutant present. The results are also acceptable if the sum of the responses does not exceed 0.5 ppmv for a calibration span of 5 to 10 ppmv, or 0.2 ppmv for a calibration span <5 ppmv.
