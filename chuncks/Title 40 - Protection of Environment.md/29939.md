######## Ramping down waste feed.

(viii)(A) You may ramp down the waste feedrate of pumpable hazardous waste over a period not to exceed one minute, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii)(B) of this section. If you elect to ramp down the waste feed, you must document ramp down procedures in the operating and maintenance plan. The procedures must specify that the ramp down begins immediately upon initiation of automatic waste feed cutoff and the procedures must prescribe a bona fide ramping down. If an emission standard or operating limit is exceeded during the ramp down, you have failed to comply with the emission standards or operating requirements of this subpart.

(B) If the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by an exceedance of any of the following operating limits, you may not ramp down the waste feed cutoff: Minimum combustion chamber temperature, maximum hazardous waste feedrate, or any hazardous waste firing system operating limits that may be established for your combustor.
