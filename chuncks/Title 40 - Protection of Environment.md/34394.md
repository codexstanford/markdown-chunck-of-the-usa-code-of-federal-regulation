#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart KKKK - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Surface Coating of Metal Cans
###### Emission Limitations
####### ยง 63.3491 What are my options for meeting the emission limits?

You must include all coatings and thinners used in all surface coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment when determining whether the organic HAP emission rate is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in ยง 63.3490. To make that determination, you must use at least one of the four compliance options listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coating operation or to multiple coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment as a group. You may use different compliance options for different coating operations or at different times on the same coating operation. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coating operation. If you switch between compliance options for any coating operation or group of coating operations, you must document that switch as required by ยง 63.3512(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in ยง 63.3511.
