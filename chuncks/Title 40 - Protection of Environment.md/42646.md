###### ยง 75.24 Out-of-control periods and adjustment for system bias.
####### i.e.,

(d) When the bias test indicates that an SOmonitor, a flow monitor, a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, or a NOconcentration monitoring system used to determine NOmass emissions, as defined in ยง 75.71(a)(2), is biased low (the arithmetic mean of the differences between the reference method value and the monitor or monitoring system measurements in a relative accuracy test audit exceed the bias statistic in section 7 of appendix A to this part), the owner or operator shall adjust the monitor or continuous emission monitoring system to eliminate the cause of bias such that it passes the bias test or calculate and use the bias adjustment factor as specified in section 2.3.4 of appendix B to this part.

(e) The owner or operator shall determine if a continuous opacity monitoring system is out-of-control and shall take appropriate corrective actions according to the procedures specified for State Implementation Plans, pursuant to appendix M of part 51 of this chapter. The owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements of the State. If the State has no monitor data availability requirements for continuous opacity monitoring systems, then the owner or operator shall comply with the monitor data availability requirements as stated in the data capture provisions of appendix M, part 51 of this chapter.
