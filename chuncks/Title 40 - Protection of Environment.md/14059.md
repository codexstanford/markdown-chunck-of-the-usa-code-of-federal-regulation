() Could not have been avoided by better operation and maintenance practices;

(C) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable;

(D) The amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;

(ii) For claims of startup or shutdown:

(A) All or a portion of the facility was in startup or shutdown mode, resulting in the need to route gases to the flare;

(B) The periods of excess emissions that occurred during startup and shutdown were short and infrequent and could not have been prevented through careful planning and design or better operation and maintenance practices; and

(C) The frequency and duration of operation in startup or shutdown mode were minimized to the maximum extent practicable;

(iii) For claims of malfunction, startup, or shutdown:

(A) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(B) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality;

(C) All emissions monitoring systems were kept in operation if at all possible;

(D) The owner or operator's actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;

(E) The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;

(F) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and

(G) During the period of excess emissions, there were no exceedances of the SONAAQS that could be attributed to the emitting source.
