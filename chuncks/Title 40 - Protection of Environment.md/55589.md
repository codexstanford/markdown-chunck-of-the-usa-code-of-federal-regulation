##### Appendix B to Part 136 - Definition and Procedure for the Determination of the Method Detection Limit - Revision 2

The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum measured concentration of a substance that can be reported with 99% confidence that the measured concentration is distinguishable from method blank results.

(1) The MDL procedure is designed to be a straightforward technique for estimation of the detection limit for a broad variety of physical and chemical methods. The procedure requires a complete, specific, and well-defined analytical method. It is essential that all sample processing steps used by the laboratory be included in the determination of the method detection limit.
