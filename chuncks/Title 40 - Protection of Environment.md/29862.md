####### ยง 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## New or reconstructed sources.

(ii)(A) If you commenced construction or reconstruction of your hazardous waste combustor after April 20, 2004, you must comply with the new source emission standards of this subpart by the later of October 12, 2005, or the date the source starts operations, except as provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The costs of retrofitting and replacement of equipment that is installed specifically to comply with this subpart, between April 20, 2004, and a source's compliance date, are not considered to be reconstruction costs.

(B) For a standard in the subpart that is more stringent than the standard proposed on April 20, 2004, you may achieve compliance no later than October 14, 2008, if you comply with the standard proposed on April 20, 2004, after October 12, 2005. This exception does not apply, however, to new or reconstructed area source hazardous waste combustors that become major sources after October 14, 2008. As provided by ยง 63.6(b)(7), such sources must comply with this subpart at startup.
