Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence appropriate test sites must be selected to provide the minimum number of test measurement sets to meet the requirements for PMconcentrations in the ranges specified in table C-4 of this subpart. Only one test site is required, and the site need only meet the PMambient concentration levels required by table C-4 of this subpart and the requirements of ยง 53.30(b) of this subpart. A total of 10 valid measurement sets is required.
