####### Program scope.

(b)(1) This element shall contain a clear definition of the sources affected by the program. This definition shall address:

(i) The extent to which the program is mandatory or voluntary for the affected sources.

(ii) Provisions, if any, by which sources that are not required to be in the program may voluntarily enter the program.

(iii) Provisions, if any, by which sources covered by the program may voluntarily leave the program.

(2) Any opt-in or opt-out provisions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be designed to provide mechanisms by which such program changes are reflected in an area's attainment and RFP demonstrations, thus ensuring that there will not be an increase in the emissions inventory for the area caused by voluntary entry or exit from the program.

(3) The program scope shall be defined so as not to interfere with any other Federal requirements which apply to the affected sources.
