(c) To determinevalues for certifying a tractor, perform CFD modeling based on a tractor-trailer combination using the manufacturer's tractor and a standard trailer. To determinevalues for certifying a trailer, perform CFD modeling based on a tractor-trailer combination using a standard tractor. Perform all CFD modeling as follows:

(1) Specify a blockage ratio at or below 0.2% to simulate open-road conditions.

(2) Assume zero yaw angle.

(3) Model the tractor with an open grill and representative back pressures based on available data describing the tractor's pressure characteristics.

(4) Enable the turbulence model and mesh deformation.

(5) Model tires and ground plane in motion to simulate a vehicle moving forward in the direction of travel.
