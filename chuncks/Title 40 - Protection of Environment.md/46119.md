(ii)-(A)The OBD system must detect a catalyst malfunction when the catalyst conversion capability decreases to the point that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for NOaftertreatment systems as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). If no failure or deterioration of the catalyst NOconversion capability could result in an engine's emissions exceeding any of the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the catalyst has no detectable amount of NOconversion capability.
