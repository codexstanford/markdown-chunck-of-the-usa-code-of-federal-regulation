###### Potential human food chain contamination.

4.1.3.3.2.3Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to potential human food chain contamination. Do not include those fisheries (or portion of fisheries) already counted under the Level I or Level II concentrations factors.

Calculate the value for the potential human food chain contamination factor (PF) for the watershed as follows:

In calculating PF:

- Estimate the human food chain population value (P) for a fishery (or portion of a fishery) as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.

- Assign the fishery (or portion of a fishery) a dilution weight as indicated in table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1), except: do not assign a dilution weight of 0.5 for a "3-mile mixing zone in quiet flowing river"; instead assign a dilution weight based on the average annual flow.

If PF is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PF is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
