####### Internal combustion

means the combustion of a fuel that occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber. In an internal combustion engine the expansion of the high-temperature and -pressure gases produced by combustion applies direct force to a component of the engine, such as pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, generating useful mechanical energy. Internal combustion equipment may include gasoline and diesel industrial engines, natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, and gas turbines.
