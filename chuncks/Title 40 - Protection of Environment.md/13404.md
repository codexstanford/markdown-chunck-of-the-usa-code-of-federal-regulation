####### Determination of attainment.

(x)EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

(y) Determination-EPA has determined that, as of July 12, 2012, the Baltimore 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard and that this determination obviates the requirement for Maryland to submit for the Baltimore area the 1-hour ozone contingency measure requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act.

(z) EPA approves the attainment demonstration portion of the attainment plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Philadelphia Area submitted as a revision to the State Implementation Plan by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on June 4, 2007. EPA also approves the 2009 motor vehicle emissions budgets associated with the attainment demonstration for Cecil County, Maryland.

(aa) EPA approves revisions to the Maryland State Implementation Plan consisting of the attainment demonstration required under 40 CFR 51.908 demonstrating attainment of the 1997 ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2010 and the failure to attain contingency measures for the Washington, DC-MD-VA 1997 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on June 4, 2007.

(bb) EPA approves the following 2009 attainment demonstration and 2010 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for the Washington, DC-MDVA 1997 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on June 4, 2007:

(cc) EPA approves revisions to the Maryland State Implementation Plan consisting of the serious area reasonable further progress (RFP) plan for the Baltimore 1997 8-hour ozone serious nonattainment area, including 2011 and 2012 RFP milestones, updates to the 2008 RFP milestones previously approved by EPA under paragraph (q) of this section, and contingency measures for failure to meet 2012 RFP, submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on July 22, 2013.

(dd) EPA approves the following 2012 RFP motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for the Baltimore 1997 8-hour ozone serious nonattainment area, in tons per day (tpd) of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO), submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on July 22, 2013:

(ee) EPA approves the maintenance plan for the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC-MD-VA nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on February 5, 2018. The maintenance plan includes 2014, 2025, and 2030 motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for VOC and NOto be applied to all future transportation conformity determinations and analyses for the entire Washington, DC-MD-VA area for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The maintenance plan includes two sets of VOC and NOMVEBs: The MVEBs without transportation buffers are effective as EPA has determined them adequate for transportation conformity purposes; the MVEBs with transportation buffers will be used only as needed in situations where the conformity analysis must be based on different data, models, or planning assumptions, including, but not limited to, updates to demographic, land use, or project-related assumptions, than were used to create the set of MVEBs without transportation buffers. The technical analyses used to demonstrate compliance with the MVEBs and the need, if any, to use transportation buffers will be fully documented in the conformity analysis and follow the Transportation Planning Board's (TPB) interagency consultation procedures.

(ff) The EPA has determined that the Baltimore, Maryland Moderate nonattainment area attained the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2018, based upon complete quality-assured and certified data for the calendar years 2015-2017.
