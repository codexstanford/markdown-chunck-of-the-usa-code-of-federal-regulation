####### Example of the unnormalization procedure.

(b)Unnormalize the following test point, given Maximum Test speed = 3800 rpm and Curb Idle Speed = 600 rpm.

(1) Calculate actual rpm:

(2) Determine actual torque: Determine the maximum observed torque at 1829 rpm from the maximum torque curve. Then multiply this value (e.g., 358 ft-lbs) by 0.82. This results in an actual torque of 294 ft-lbs.
