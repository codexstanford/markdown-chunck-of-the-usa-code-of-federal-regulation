###### What This Subpart Covers
####### § 63.2342 When do I have to comply with this subpart?

(a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must comply with this subpart according to the schedule identified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.

(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, if you startup your new affected source on or before February 3, 2004 or if you reconstruct your affected source on or before February 3, 2004, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than February 3, 2004.

(ii) For any emission source listed in paragraph § 63.2338(b) at an affected source that commenced construction or reconstruction after April 2, 2002, but before February 3, 2004, that is required to be controlled based on the applicability criteria in this subpart, but:

(A) Would not have been required to be controlled based on the applicability criteria as proposed for this subpart, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section or at startup, whichever is later; or

(B) Would have been subject to a less stringent degree of control requirement as proposed for this subpart, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section or at startup, whichever is later, and if you start up your affected new or reconstructed source before February 5, 2007, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for each such emission source as proposed for this subpart, until you are required to comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) If you commence construction of or reconstruct your affected source after February 3, 2004, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.

(3) If, after startup of a new affected source, the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume at that source exceeds the criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, items 9 and 10, the owner or operator must comply with the transfer rack requirements specified in § 63.2346(b) immediately; that is, be in compliance the first day of the period following the end of the 3-year period triggering the control criteria.

(b) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if you have an existing affected source, you must comply with this subpart according to the schedule identified in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.

(1) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for existing affected sources no later than February 5, 2007, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.

(2) Floating roof storage tanks at existing affected sources must be in compliance with the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart, item 1, at all times after the next degassing and cleaning activity or within 10 years after February 3, 2004, whichever occurs first. If the first degassing and cleaning activity occurs during the 3 years following February 3, 2004, the compliance date is February 5, 2007.

(3)(i) If an addition or change other than reconstruction as defined in § 63.2 is made to an existing affected facility that causes the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume to exceed the criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, items 7 and 8, the owner or operator must comply with the transfer rack requirements specified in § 63.2346(b) immediately; that is, be in compliance the first day of the period following the end of the 3-year period triggering the control criteria.

(ii) If the owner or operator believes that compliance with the transfer rack emission limits cannot be achieved immediately, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may submit a request for a compliance extension, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) through (I) of this section. Subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), the owner or operator of the transfer rack subject to the requirements of this section shall comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart. Advice on requesting an extension of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program).
