####### ยง 63.3370 How do I demonstrate compliance with the emission standards?
######## Solvent recovery system using performance test compliance demonstration and CEMS.

(2)To demonstrate compliance through an initial test of capture efficiency, continuous monitoring of a capture system operating parameter, and a CEMS on each solvent recovery system used to control one or more web coating lines, you must:

(i) For each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system, monitor the operating parameter established in accordance with ยง 63.3350(f) to ensure capture system efficiency; and

(ii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those web coating lines served by each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system either:

(A) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii), (v), (vi), and (viii) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have only always-controlled work stations; or

(B) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii), (vi), and (p) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controlled work stations.
