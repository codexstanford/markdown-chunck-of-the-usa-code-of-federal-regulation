###### ยง 1036.535 Determining steady-state engine fuel maps and fuel consumption at idle.
####### [object Object]

(8) If you determine fuel-consumption rates using emission measurements from the raw or diluted exhaust, calculate the mean fuel mass flow rate,, for each point in the fuel map using the following equation:

(9) If you determine fuel-consumption rates using emission measurements with engines that utilize diesel exhaust fluid for NOcontrol and you correct for the mean COmass emission rate resulting from diesel exhaust fluid decomposition as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, perform this correction at each fuel map setpoint using the following equation:

(10) Correct the measured or calculated mean fuel mass flow rate, at each of the engine-idle operating points to account for mass-specific net energy content as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
