This method recommends that the laboratory purchase dilute standard solutions of the analytes required for this method. However, if preparing primary solutions, use a hood or glove box. Laboratory personnel handling primary solutions should wear personal protective equipment including a toxic gas respirator mask fitted with charcoal filters approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) to prevent the inhalation of airborne particulates if not working in an approved hood or glove box.
