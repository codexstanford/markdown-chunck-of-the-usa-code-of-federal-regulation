####### Intermediate change to monitoring

means a modification to federally required monitoring involving "proven technology" (generally accepted by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally required monitoring. Examples of intermediate changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:

(1) Use of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) in lieu of a parameter monitoring approach;

(2) Decreased frequency for non-continuous parameter monitoring or physical inspections;

(3) Changes to quality control requirements for parameter monitoring; and

(4) Use of an electronic data reduction system in lieu of manual data reduction.
