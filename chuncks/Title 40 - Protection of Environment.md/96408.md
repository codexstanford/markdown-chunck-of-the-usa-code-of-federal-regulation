####### Definitions.

(b)(1) A forward mutation assay detects a gene mutation from the parental type to the mutant form which gives rise to a change in an enzymatic or functional protein.

(2) Base pair mutagens are agents which cause a base change in the DNA.

(3) Frameshift mutagens are agents which cause the addition or deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule.

(4) Phenotypic expression time is a period during which unaltered gene products are depleted from newly mutated cells.
