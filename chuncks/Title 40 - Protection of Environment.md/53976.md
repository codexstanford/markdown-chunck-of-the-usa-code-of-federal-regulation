####### Qualification.

(1)To qualify for this exclusion, the operator of the discharge must:

(i) Provide a storm resistant shelter to protect industrial materials and activities from exposure to rain, snow, snow melt, and runoff;

(ii) Complete and sign (according to ยง 122.22) a certification that there are no discharges of storm water contaminated by exposure to industrial materials and activities from the entire facility, except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section;

(iii) Submit the signed certification to the NPDES permitting authority once every five years. As of December 21, 2025 or an EPA-approved alternative date (see 40 CFR 127.24(e) or (f)), all certifications submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the owner or operator to the Director or initial recipient, as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b), in compliance with this section and 40 CFR part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to part 3), ยง 122.22, and 40 CFR part 127. 40 CFR part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of 40 CFR part 127, owners or operators may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.

(iv) Allow the Director to inspect the facility to determine compliance with the "no exposure" conditions;

(v) Allow the Director to make any "no exposure" inspection reports available to the public upon request; and

(vi) For facilities that discharge through an MS4, upon request, submit a copy of the certification of "no exposure" to the MS4 operator, as well as allow inspection and public reporting by the MS4 operator.
