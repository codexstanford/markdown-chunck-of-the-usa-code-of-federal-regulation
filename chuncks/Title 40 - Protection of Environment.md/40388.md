##### ยง 64.3 Monitoring design criteria.
###### Special criteria for the use of continuous emission, opacity or predictive monitoring systems.

(d)(1) If a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) or predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) is required pursuant to other authority under the Act or state or local law, the owner or operator shall use such system to satisfy the requirements of this part.

(2) The use of a CEMS, COMS, or PEMS that satisfies any of the following monitoring requirements shall be deemed to satisfy the general design criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, provided that a COMS may be subject to the criteria for establishing indicator ranges under paragraph (a) of this section:

(i) Section 51.214 and appendix P of part 51 of this chapter;

(ii) Section 60.13 and appendix B of part 60 of this chapter;

(iii) Section 63.8 and any applicable performance specifications required pursuant to the applicable subpart of part 63 of this chapter;

(iv) Part 75 of this chapter;

(v) Subpart H and appendix IX of part 266 of this chapter; or

(vi) If an applicable requirement does not otherwise require compliance with the requirements listed in the preceding paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, comparable requirements and specifications established by the permitting authority.

(3) The owner or operator shall design the monitoring system subject to this paragraph (d) to:

(i) Allow for reporting of exceedances (or excursions if applicable to a COMS used to assure compliance with a particulate matter standard), consistent with any period for reporting of exceedances in an underlying requirement. If an underlying requirement does not contain a provision for establishing an averaging period for the reporting of exceedances or excursions, the criteria used to develop an averaging period in (b)(4) of this section shall apply; and

(ii) Provide an indicator range consistent with paragraph (a) of this section for a COMS used to assure compliance with a particulate matter standard. If an opacity standard applies to the pollutant-specific emissions unit, such limit may be used as the appropriate indicator range unless the opacity limit fails to meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section after considering the type of control device and other site-specific factors applicable to the pollutant-specific emissions unit.
