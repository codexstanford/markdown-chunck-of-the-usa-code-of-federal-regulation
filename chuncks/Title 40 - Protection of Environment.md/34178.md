######## Final repair

means the operations performed and coating(s) applied to completely-assembled motor vehicles or to parts that are not yet on a completely assembled motor vehicle to correct damage or imperfections in the coating. The curing of the coatings applied in these operations is accomplished at a lower temperature than that used for curing primer-surfacer and topcoat. This lower temperature cure avoids the need to send parts that are not yet on a completely assembled vehicle through the same type of curing process used for primer-surfacer and topcoat and is necessary to protect heat sensitive components on completely assembled motor vehicles.
