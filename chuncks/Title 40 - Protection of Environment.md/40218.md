###### Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer

means an analytical system that employs a source of mid-infrared radiation, an interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, an infrared detector, optical elements that transfer infrared radiation between components, and a computer system. The time-domain detector response (interferogram) is processed by a Fourier transform to yield a representation of the detector response vs. infrared frequency.
