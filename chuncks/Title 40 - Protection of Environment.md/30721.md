####### Sampling plan.

(vi)The owner or operator shall prepare a sampling plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds. An example of an acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The sampling plan shall be maintained at the facility.
