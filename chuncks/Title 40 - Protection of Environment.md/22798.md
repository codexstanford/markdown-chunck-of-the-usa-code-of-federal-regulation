12.6.7 Calculate the mean difference () between the RM and CEMS values in the units of ppmv or the emission standard using Equation 12.

12.6.8 Calculate the average RM value using Equation 13.

12.6.9 Calculate RA of the CEMS using Equation 14.

13.1 Level of Detection. You may not use a CEMS whose LOD or SADL is greater than 20 percent of the applicable regulatory limit or other action level for the intended use of the data.

13.2 Calibration Drift. The zero- and mid-level calibration drift for the CEMS must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value for 7 consecutive operating days.

13.3 Measurement Error. The ME must be less than or equal to 5.0 percent of the span value at the low-, mid-, and high-level reference gas concentrations.
