####### Use of banked emission credits.

(3)The use of banked credits shall be within the averaging set and geographic restrictions described in paragraph (d) of this section, and only for the following purposes:

(i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, or in trading, or in any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits declared for banking from the previous model year but not reported to EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the reported credits cannot be proven, they will be revoked and unavailable for use.

(ii) Banked credits may not be used for averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing. However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the test group if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
