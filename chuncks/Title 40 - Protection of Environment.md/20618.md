######## Reconstruction

means rebuilding a CISWI and meeting two criteria:

(1) The reconstruction begins on or after August 7, 2013; and

(2) The cumulative cost of the construction over the life of the incineration unit exceeds 50 percent of the original cost of building and installing the CISWI (not including land) updated to current costs (current dollars). To determine what systems are within the boundary of the CISWI used to calculate these costs, see the definition of CISWI.
