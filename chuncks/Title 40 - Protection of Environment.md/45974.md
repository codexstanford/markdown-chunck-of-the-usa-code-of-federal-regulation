####### Calculation of adjustment factors.

(2)The adjustment factors are calculated from the following parameters: the measured emissions from a test in which the regeneration occurs (EF), the measured emissions from a test in which the regeneration does not occur (EF), and the frequency of the regeneration event in terms of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs (F). The average emission rate (EF) is calculated as:

(i) The upward adjustment factor (UAF) is calculated as: UAF = EF- EF.

(ii) The downward adjustment factor (DAF) is calculated as: DAF = EF- EF.
