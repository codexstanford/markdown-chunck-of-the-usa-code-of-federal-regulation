###### Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate With Add-On Controls Option
####### § 63.4961 How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
######## When add-on controls are used.

(a)You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You may include both controlled and uncontrolled coating operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, and each controlled coating operation must meet the operating limits and work practice standards required in §§ 63.4892 and 63.4893, respectively. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option.
