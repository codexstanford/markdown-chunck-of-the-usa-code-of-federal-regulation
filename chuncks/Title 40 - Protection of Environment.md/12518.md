####### Exemptions from emission limitations,Exemptions for all source categories except wood furniture coating.

(3)-(i)The limitations of paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply to coating lines within a facility, that otherwise would be subject to the same subparagraph of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (because they belong to the same source category, e.g. can coating), provided that combined actual emissions of VOM from all lines at the facility subject to that subparagraph never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices. (For example, can coating lines within a plant would not be subject to the limitations of subparagraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section if the combined actual emissions of VOM from the can coating lines never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices.) Volatile organic material emissions from heavy off-highway vehicle products coating lines must be combined with VOM emissions from miscellaneous metal parts and products coating lines to determine applicability. Any owner or operator of a coating facility shall comply with the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section if total VOM emissions from the subject coating lines are always less than or equal to 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices and, therefore, are not subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Once a category of coating lines at a facility is subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the coating lines are always subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
