###### ยง 141.88 Monitoring requirements for lead and copper in source water.
####### Monitoring frequency after system exceeds tap water action level.

(b)Any system which exceeds the lead or copper action level at the tap for the first time or for the first time after an addition of a new source or installation of source water treatment required under ยง 141.83(b)(2) shall collect one source water sample from each entry point to the distribution system no later than six months after the end of the tap sampling period during which the lead or copper action level was exceeded. For tap sampling periods that are annual or less frequent, the end of the tap sampling period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or if the State has established an alternate monitoring period, the last day of that period. If the State determines that source water treatment is not required under ยง 141.83(b)(2), the state may waive source water monitoring, for any subsequent lead or copper action level exceedance at the tap, in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(1) The State may waive source water monitoring for lead or copper action level exceedance at the tap under the following conditions:

(i) The water system has already conducted source water monitoring following a previous action level exceedance;

(ii) The State has determined that source water treatment is not required; and

(iii) The system has not added any new water sources.

(2) [Reserved]
