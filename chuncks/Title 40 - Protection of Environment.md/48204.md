####### t,

(2) For both the numerator and the denominator of the vehicle-pass ratio, use the smallest of the following values for determining the duration,of any NTE sampling event:

(i) The measured time in the NTE zone that is valid for an NTE sampling event.

(ii) 600 seconds.

(iii) 10 times the length of the shortest valid NTE sampling event for all testing with that engine.

(f) The following example illustrates how to select the duration of NTE sampling events for calculations, as described in paragraph (f) of this section:

(g) Engines meet the vehicle-pass criteria under this section if they meet both of the following criteria:

(1) The vehicle-pass ratio calculated according to paragraph (e) of this section must be at least 0.90 for each pollutant.

(2) For model year 2007 through 2009 engines, emission levels from every valid NTE sampling event must be less than 2.0 times the NTE thresholds calculated according to paragraph (a) of this section for all pollutants, except that engines certified to a NOFEL at or below 0.50 g/hp&#xB7;hr may meet the vehicle-pass criteria for NOif measured NOemissions from every valid NTE sample are less than either 2.0 times the NTE threshold for NOor 2.0 g/hp&#xB7;hr, whichever is greater.
