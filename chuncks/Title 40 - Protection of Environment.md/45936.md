####### Optional standard.

(C)Manufacturers may elect to certify to an Oxides of Nitrogen plus Non-methane Hydrocarbons (or equivalent for methanol-fueled engines) standard of 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.93 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions, provided that Non-methane Hydrocarbons (or equivalent for methanol-fueled engines) do not exceed 0.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.19 gram per megajoule) NMHC (or NMHCE for methanol-fueled engines), as measured under transient operating conditions.

(D) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its diesel HDE families in any or all of the emissions ABT programs for HDEs, within the restrictions described in ยง 86.004-15 or superseding applicable sections. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NOplus NMHC (or NOplus NMHCE for methanol-fueled engines) FELs may not exceed 4.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.7 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, banking, or trading programs. Additionally, families certified to the optional standard contained in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section shall not exceed 0.50 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.19 gram per megajoule) NMHC (or NMHCE for methanol-fueled engines) through the use of credits.
