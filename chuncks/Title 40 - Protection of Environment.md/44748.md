###### ยง 82.32 Definitions.
####### i.e.,

(4) Facilities that charge MVACs or MVAC-like appliances with refrigerant but do not perform any other service involving refrigerant (perform "top-offs" only) are considered to be engaged in "service involving refrigerant" and are therefore subject to any and all requirements of this subsection that apply to facilities that perform a wider range of refrigerant servicing. For facilities that charge MVACs, this includes the requirement to purchase approved refrigerant recycling equipment. For facilities that only charge MVAC-like appliances, this does not include the requirement to purchase approved refrigerant recycling equipment, but does include the requirement to be properly trained and certified by a technician certification program approved by the Administrator pursuant to either ยง 82.40 or ยง 82.161(a)(5).

(5) All persons opening (as that term is defined in ยง 82.152) MVAC-like appliances must have at least one piece of approved recovery or recycling equipment available at their place of business.
