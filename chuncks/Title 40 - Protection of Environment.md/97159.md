() P and Ffemales shall continue to be exposed to MEKO for at least an additional 2 weeks following weaning of offspring to permit them to begin cycling once again. They shall then be sacrificed and their ovaries shall be serially sectioned with a sufficient number of sections examined to adequately detail oocyte and follicular morphology. The methods of Mattison and Thorgiersson (1979) and Pederson and Peters (1968) under paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section, respectively, may provide guidance. The strategy for sectioning and evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigators, but shall be described in detail in the study plan and final report. The nature and background level of lesions in control tissue shall also be noted.
