####### Initial notifications.

(1)(i)(A) If a source that otherwise would be subject to these emissions standards subsequently increases its use of ethylene oxide within any consecutive 12-month period after December 6, 1996, such that the source becomes subject to these emissions standards or other requirements, such source shall be subject to the notification requirements of § 63.9 of subpart A of this part.

(B) Sources subject to these emissions standards may use the application for approval of construction or reconstruction under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and § 63.5(d) (3) of subpart A of this part, respectively, if relevant to fulfill the initial notification requirements.

(ii) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to these emissions standards that has an initial startup date after the effective date and for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and § 63.5(d) (3) and (4) of subpart A of this part shall provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:

(A) A notification of intention to construct a new source subject to these emissions standards, reconstruct a source subject to these emissions standards, or reconstruct a source such that the source becomes a source subject to these emissions standards with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section;

(B) A notification of the date when construction or reconstruction was commenced, submitted simultaneously with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction, if construction or reconstruction was commenced before the effective date of these standards;

(C) A notification of the date when construction or reconstruction was commenced, delivered or postmarked not later than 30 days after such date, if construction or reconstruction was commenced after the effective date of these standards;

(D) A notification of the anticipated date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days before such date; and

(E) A notification of the actual date of initial startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.

(iii) After the effective date, whether or not an approved permit program is effective in the State in which a source subject to these emissions standards is (or would be) located, an owner or operator who intends to construct a new source subject to these emissions standards or reconstruct a source subject to these emissions standards, or reconstruct a source such that it becomes a source subject to these emissions standards, shall notify the Administrator in writing of the intended construction or reconstruction. The notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before the construction or reconstruction is planned to commence (but no sooner than the effective date of these standards) if the construction or reconstruction commences after the effective date of the standard. The notification shall be submitted as soon as practicable before the initial startup date but no later than 60 days after the effective date of this standard if the construction or reconstruction had commenced and the initial startup date has not occurred before the standard's effective date. The notification shall include all the information required for an application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and § 63.5(d)(3) and (4) of subpart A of this part. For sources subject to these emissions standards, the application for approval of construction or reconstruction may be used to fulfill the initial notification requirements of § 63.9 of subpart A of this part.

(2) If an owner or operator of a source subject to these emissions standards submits estimates or preliminary information in the application for approval of construction or reconstruction required in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and § 63.5(d)(3) of subpart A of this part, respectively, in place of the actual emissions data or control efficiencies required in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B)(8) and (ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the actual emissions data and other correct information as soon as available but no later than with the initial notification of compliance status.

(3) The owner or operator of any existing sterilization facility subject to this subpart shall also include the amount of ethylene oxide used during the previous consecutive 12-month period in the initial notification report required by § 63.9(b)(2) and (3) of subpart A of this part. For new sterilization facilities subject to this subpart, the amount of ethylene oxide used shall be an estimate of expected use during the first consecutive 12-month period of operation.
