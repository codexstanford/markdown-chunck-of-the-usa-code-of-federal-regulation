######## Aftertreatment break in.

(b)Break in the emission-data engine and aftertreatment prior to the initial zero-hour test by running both on an engine dynamometer as described in subpart E of this part. Use good engineering judgment to develop a representative cycle that represents the field data. You may use the same data used for accelerated aging cycle development or other data. If your system utilizes infrequent regeneration, include at least one complete regeneration event, but we recommend that you include at least two such events to stabilize emissions performance. Your break in process must include at least 125 hours of engine operation with the aftertreatment system. You may ask to use a longer break in duration based on good engineering judgment, to ensure that emission performance is stabilized prior to the zero-hour testing.
