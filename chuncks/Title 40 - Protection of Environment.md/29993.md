######## Quality assurance,Set-points established without extrapolation.

(v)-(A)If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the average of the PM concentrations demonstrated during the comprehensive performance test. Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.
