(ii)The fuel flow shall continue until the refueling nozzle automatic shut-off is activated. The amount of fuel dispensed must be at least 85 percent of nominal fuel tank volume, determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter). If automatic nozzle shut-off occurs prior to this point, the nozzle shall be reactivated within 15 seconds and fuel dispensing continued as needed. A minimum of 3 seconds shall elapse between any automatic shutoff and subsequent resumption of dispensing. Dispensing may not be manually terminated, unless the test vehicle has already clearly failed the test.

(8)(i) The final reading of the evaporative enclosure FID analyzer shall be taken 60+/-5 seconds following the final shut-off of fuel flow. This is the final hydrocarbon concentration, C, required in ยง 86.143-96. The elapsed time, in minutes, between the initial and final FID (or HFID) readings shall be recorded.
