() Use Equation 14 of this subpart over specific temperature increments. If the initial temperature is lower than 10 K below the boiling point, emissions must be calculated as the sum over two increments; one increment is from the initial temperature to 10 K below the boiling point, and the second is from 10 K below the boiling point to the lower of either the final temperature or the temperature 5 K below the boiling point. If the initial temperature is higher than 10 K below the boiling point, emissions are calculated over one increment from the initial temperature to the lower of either the final temperature or the temperature 5 K below the boiling point.
