####### Transfer facility

means any transportation-related facility including loading docks, parking areas, and other similar areas where shipments of PCB waste are held during the normal course of transportation. Transport vehicles are not transfer facilities under this definition, unless they are used for the storage of PCB waste, rather than for actual transport activities. Storage areas for PCB waste at transfer facilities are subject to the storage facility standards of ยง 761.65, but such storage areas are exempt from the approval requirements of ยง 761.65(d) and the recordkeeping requirements of ยง 761.180, unless the same PCB waste is stored there for a period of more than 10 consecutive days between destinations.
