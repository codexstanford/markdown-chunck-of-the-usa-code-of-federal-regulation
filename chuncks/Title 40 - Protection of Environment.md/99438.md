####### Alternator/generator efficiency

means the ratio of the electrical power output from the alternator/generator to the mechanical power input to the alternator/generator at the operating point. Note that the alternator/generator efficiency may be different at different operating points. For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Standard 115 ("Test Procedures for Synchronous Machines") is an appropriate test procedure for determining alternator/generator efficiency. Other methods may also be used consistent with good engineering judgment.
