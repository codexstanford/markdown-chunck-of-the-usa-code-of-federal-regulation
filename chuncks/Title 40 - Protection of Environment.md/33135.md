###### ยง 63.1657 Monitoring requirements.
####### Venturi scrubbers.

(b)(1) The owner or operator must monitor the pressure drop across the venturi at least every 5 minutes and record the average hourly pressure drop. Measurement of an average hourly pressure drop less than the pressure drop operating parameter limit established during a successful compliance demonstration would be a violation of the applicable emission standard, unless the excursion in the pressure drop is due to a malfunction.

(2) As part of the maintenance plan required by ยง 63.1655(b), the owner or operator must develop and implement corrective action procedures to be followed in the case of a violation of the pressure drop requirement. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action as soon as practicable after the excursion.

(3) Failure to monitor or failure to take corrective action under the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section would be a violation of the general duty to operate in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices that minimizes emissions per ยง 63.1652(f).
