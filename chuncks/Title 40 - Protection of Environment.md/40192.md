4.12Using appendix C of this addendum, measure or obtain estimates of the noise level (RMS, absorbance) of the FTIR system. Alternatively, construct the complete spectrometer system and determine the values RMSusing appendix G of this addendum. Estimate the minimum measurement uncertainty for each analyte (MAU, ppm) and known interferant (MIU, ppm) using appendix D of this addendum. Verify that (a) MAU<(AU)(DL), FRUi <AU, and FCUi <AUfor each analyte and that (b) the CTS chosen meets the requirements listed in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 of this addendum.
