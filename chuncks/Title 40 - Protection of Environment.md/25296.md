####### Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources

means the emission limitation which is not less stringent that the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the maximum degree of deduction in emissions that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by the constructed or reconstructed major source.
