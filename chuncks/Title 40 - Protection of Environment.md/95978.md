####### Physical measurements.

(8)Measurements or monitoring shall be made of the following:

(i) The rate of air flow shall be monitored continuously and recorded at least every 30 minutes.

(ii) The actual concentrations of the test substance shall be measured in the breathing zone. During the exposure period the actual concentrations of the test substance shall be held as constant as practicable, monitored continuously or intermittently depending on the method of analysis, and recorded at least at the beginning, at an intermediate time, and at the end of the exposure period.

(iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analysis shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of particle size distribution.

(iv) Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously but shall be recorded at least every 30 minutes.
