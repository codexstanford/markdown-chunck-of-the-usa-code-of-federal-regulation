####### Shipping potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals.

(a)A healthcare facility or a reverse distributor who transports or offers for transport potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceuticals off-site to a reverse distributor must comply with all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR part 171 through 180 for any potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical that meets the definition of hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8. For purposes of the Department of Transportation regulations, a material is considered a hazardous waste if it is subject to the Hazardous Waste Manifest Requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency specified in 40 CFR part 262. Because a potentially creditable hazardous waste pharmaceutical does not require a manifest, it is not considered hazardous waste under the Department of Transportation regulations.
