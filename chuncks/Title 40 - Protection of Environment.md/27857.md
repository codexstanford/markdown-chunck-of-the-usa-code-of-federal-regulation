####### Primer, topcoat, and specialty coating application operations-organic HAP and VOC

(c). Each owner or operator required to comply with the organic HAP and VOC content limits specified in § 63.745(c) shall record the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section, as appropriate. Each owner and operator using coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance with the applicable organic HAP or VOC limit specified in § 63.745(c) may retain the manufacturer's documentation and annual purchase records in place of the records specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section. Owners and operators using the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating, and adding non-HAP solvent to those coatings, must also maintain records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.

(1) The name and VOC content as received and as applied of each primer, topcoat, and specialty coating used at the facility.

(2) For uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that meet the organic HAP and VOC content limits in § 63.745(c)(1) through (c)(6) without averaging:

(i) The mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of coating as applied (less water) (H) and the mass of VOC emitted per unit volume of coating as applied (less water and exempt solvents) (G) for each coating formulation within each coating category used each month (as calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.750(c) and (e));

(ii) All data, calculations, and test results (including EPA Method 24 results) used in determining the values of Hand G; and

(iii) The volume (gal) of each coating formulation within each coating category used each month.

(3) For "low HAP content" uncontrolled primers with organic HAP content less than or equal to 250 g/l (2.1 lb/gal) less water as applied and VOC content less than or equal to 250 g/l (2.1 lb/gal) less water and exempt solvents as applied:

(i) Annual purchase records of the total volume of each primer purchased; and

(ii) All data, calculations, and test results (including EPA Method 24 results) used in determining the organic HAP and VOC content as applied. These records shall consist of the manufacturer's certification when the primer is applied as received, or the data and calculations used to determine Hif not applied as received.

(4) For primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings complying with the organic HAP or VOC content level by averaging:

(i) The monthly volume-weighted average masses of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of coating as applied (less water) (H) and of VOC emitted per unit volume of coating as applied (less water and exempt solvents) (G) for all coatings (as determined by the procedures specified in § 63.750(d) and (f)); and

(ii) All data, calculations, and test results (including EPA Method 24 results) used to determine the values of Hand G.

(5) For primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are controlled by a control device other than a carbon adsorber:

(i) The overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(h)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency;

(ii) If an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, continuous records of the firebox temperature recorded under § 63.751(b)(9) and all calculated 3-hour averages of the firebox temperature; and

(iii) If a catalytic incinerator is used, continuous records of the temperature recorded under § 63.751(b)(10) and all calculated 3-hour averages of the recorded temperatures.

(6) For primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are controlled by a carbon adsorber:

(i) The overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. The length of the rolling material balance period and all data and calculations used for determining this rolling period. The record of the certification of the accuracy of the device that measures the amount of HAP or VOC recovered; or

(ii) For nonregenerative carbon adsorbers, the overall control efficiency of the control system (as determined using the procedures specified in § 63.750(g)) and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. The record of the carbon replacement time established as the site-specific operating parameter to demonstrate compliance.
