####### Spot check procedures.

(c)(1) Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the Administrator may require that one or more of the test vehicles which use a simulation rather than actual testing in an environmental test cell for air conditioning emission testing be submitted at a place the Administrator will designate for air conditioning emission testing in an environmental test cell as described in ยง 86.160-00. The Administrator may order this testing to be conducted at a manufacturer facility. All manufacturers which use a simulation instead of environmental cell testing must have access to an environment test cell meeting the requirements of ยง 86.161-00 to perform this testing.

(2) An air conditioning emission test will be performed as described in ยง 86.162-00 in a full environmental test cell.

(i) The results of the original simulation test and the full environmental test cell required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are compared. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must pass both the following two criteria:

(A) The NOemission results of the simulation test must be at least 85% of the NOemission results of the environmental chamber test.

(B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.

(ii) If either of two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section were not met, a retest is allowed. The manufacturer may elect to conduct either a retest of the simulation procedure or the environmental chamber testing. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must pass both the following two criteria using the retest test result.

(A) The NOemission results of the simulation test must be at least 85% of the NOemission results of the environmental chamber test.

(B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.

(iii) If either of the two criteria of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section were not met, a second retest is allowed. The procedure not selected for the first retest must be used for the second retest, yielding two test results for each procedure. In order to pass the spot check, the test results must pass both the following two criteria using the average test result for each procedure:

(A) The NOemission results of the simulation test must be at least 85% of the NOemission results of the environmental chamber test.

(B) The fuel consumption of the simulation test must be at least 95% of the fuel consumption of the environmental chamber test.

(iv) If the spot check criteria have not passed after any of the initial test, the first retest, or the second retest the spot check is considered failed.
