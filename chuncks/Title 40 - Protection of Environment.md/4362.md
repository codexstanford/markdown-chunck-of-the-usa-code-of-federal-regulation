6.4Artifact particulate matter can be formed on the surface of alkaline glass fiber filters by oxidation of acid gases in the sample air, resulting in a higher than true TSP determination.() This effect usually occurs early in the sample period and is a function of the filter pH and the presence of acid gases. It is generally believed to account for only a small percentage of the filter weight gain, but the effect may become more significant where relatively small particulate weights are collected.
