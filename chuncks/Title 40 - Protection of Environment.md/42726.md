###### § 75.57 General recordkeeping provisions.
####### SO,emission record provisions.

(c)The owner or operator shall record for each hour the information required by this paragraph for each affected unit or group of units using a common stack and common monitoring systems, except as provided under § 75.11(e) or for a gas-fired or oil-fired unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional protocol in appendix D to this part or for a low mass emissions unit for which the owner or operator is using the optional low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19(c) for estimating SOmass emissions:

(1) For SOconcentration during unit operation, as measured and reported from each certified primary monitor, certified back-up monitor, or other approved method of emissions determination:

(i) Component-system identification code, as provided in § 75.53;

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Hourly average SOconcentration (ppm, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(iv) Hourly average SOconcentration (ppm, rounded to the nearest tenth), adjusted for bias if bias adjustment factor is required, as provided in § 75.24(d);

(v) Percent monitor data availability (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent), calculated pursuant to § 75.32; and

(vi) Method of determination for hourly average SOconcentration using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of this section.

(2) For flow rate during unit operation, as measured and reported from each certified primary monitor, certified back-up monitor, or other approved method of emissions determination:

(i) Component-system identification code, as provided in § 75.53;

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Hourly average volumetric flow rate (in scfh, rounded to the nearest thousand);

(iv) Hourly average volumetric flow rate (in scfh, rounded to the nearest thousand), adjusted for bias if bias adjustment factor required, as provided in § 75.24(d);

(v) Percent monitor data availability (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent) for the flow monitor, calculated pursuant to § 75.32; and

(vi) Method of determination for hourly average flow rate using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of this section.

(3) For flue gas moisture content during unit operation (where SOconcentration is measured on a dry basis), as measured and reported from each certified primary monitor, certified back-up monitor, or other approved method of emissions determination:

(i) Component-system identification code, as provided in § 75.53;

(ii) Date and hour;

(iii) Hourly average moisture content of flue gas (percent, rounded to the nearest tenth). If the continuous moisture monitoring system consists of wet- and dry-basis oxygen analyzers, also record both the wet- and dry-basis oxygen hourly averages (in percent O, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(iv) Percent monitor data availability (recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent) for the moisture monitoring system, calculated pursuant to § 75.32; and

(v) Method of determination for hourly average moisture percentage, using Codes 1-55 in Table 4a of this section.

(4) For SOmass emission rate during unit operation, as measured and reported from the certified primary monitoring system(s), certified redundant or non-redundant back-up monitoring system(s), or other approved method(s) of emissions determination:

(i) Date and hour;

(ii) Hourly SOmass emission rate (lb/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth);

(iii) Hourly SOmass emission rate (lb/hr, rounded to the nearest tenth), adjusted for bias if bias adjustment factor required, as provided in § 75.24(d); and

(iv) Identification code for emissions formula used to derive hourly SOmass emission rate from SOconcentration and flow and (if applicable) moisture data in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section, as provided in § 75.53.
