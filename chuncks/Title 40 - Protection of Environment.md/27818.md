####### Chemical milling maskant application operations,Performance test periods.

(h)-(1)For uncontrolled chemical milling maskants that are not averaged, each 24-hour period is considered a performance test. For compliant and noncompliant chemical milling maskants that are averaged together, each 30-day period is considered a performance test, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program. When using a control device other than a carbon adsorber, three 1-hour runs constitute the test period for the initial and any subsequent performance test. When a carbon adsorber is used, each rolling material balance period is considered a performance test.
