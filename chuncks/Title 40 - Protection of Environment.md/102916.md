###### ยง 1065.307 Linearity verification.
####### Scope and frequency.

(a)Perform linearity verification on each measurement system listed in Table 1 of this section at least as frequently as indicated in Table 1 of ยง 1065.303, consistent with measurement system manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering judgment. The intent of linearity verification is to determine that a measurement system responds accurately and proportionally over the measurement range of interest. Linearity verification generally consists of introducing a series of at least 10 reference values to a measurement system. The measurement system quantifies each reference value. The measured values are then collectively compared to the reference values by using a least-squares linear regression and the linearity criteria specified in Table 1 of this section.
