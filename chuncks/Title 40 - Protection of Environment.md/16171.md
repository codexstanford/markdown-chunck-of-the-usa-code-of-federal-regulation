####### Use of comments.

(d)(1) Written comments filed under this section shall constitute the bulk of the evidence submitted at the hearing. Oral statements at the hearing should be brief, and restricted either to points that could not have been made in written comments, or to emphasizing points which are made in the comments, but which the participant believes can be more forcefully urged in the hearing context.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, within two weeks prior to either deadline specified by paragraph (a) of this section for the filing of main comments, any person who has filed a request to participate in the hearing may file a request with the Presiding Officer to submit all or part of his main comments orally at the hearing in lieu of submitting written comments. The Presiding Officer shall, within one week, grant such request if he finds that such person will be prejudiced if he is required to submit such comments in written form.
