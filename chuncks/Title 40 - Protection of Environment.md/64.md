###### ยง 2.102 Procedures for making requests.
####### Description of records sought.

(c)A request should reasonably describe the records the requester seeks in a way that will permit EPA employees to identify and locate them. Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter. If known, the requester should include any file designations or descriptions for the records that the requester wants. The more specific the requester is about the records or type of records that the requester wants, the more likely EPA will be able to identify and locate records responsive to the request. If EPA determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records, EPA will tell the requester either what additional information the requester needs to provide or why the request is otherwise insufficient. EPA will also give the requester an opportunity to discuss and modify the request to meet the requirements of this Section.
