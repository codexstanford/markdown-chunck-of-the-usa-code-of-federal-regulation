###### Naturally occurring chemical substances.

(3)Any naturally occurring chemical substance, as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b).

If a person described in ยง 711.8 manufactures a chemical substance by means other than those described in 40 CFR 710.4(b), the person must report regardless of whether the chemical substance also could have been produced as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). Any chemical substance that is produced from such a naturally occurring chemical substance described in 40 CFR 710.4(b) is reportable unless otherwise excluded.
