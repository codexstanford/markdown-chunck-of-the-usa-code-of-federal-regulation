###### § 63.139 Process wastewater provisions - control devices.

(a) For each control device or combination of control devices used to comply with the provisions in §§ 63.133 through 63.138 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain the control device or combination of control devices in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.

(b) Whenever organic hazardous air pollutants emissions are vented to a control device which is used to comply with the provisions of this subpart, such control device shall be operating.

(c) The control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), or (c)(5) of this section.

(1) An enclosed combustion device (including but not limited to a vapor incinerator, boiler, or process heater) shall meet the conditions in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this section, alone or in combination with other control devices. If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, then the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater.

(i) Reduce the total organic compound emissions, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants emissions vented to the control device by 95 percent by weight or greater;

(ii) Achieve an outlet total organic compound concentration, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants concentration of 20 parts per million by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen. The owner or operator shall use either Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part; or

(iii) Provide a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds at a minimum temperature of 760 &#xB0;C.

(2) A vapor recovery system (including but not limited to a carbon adsorption system or condenser), alone or in combination with other control devices, shall reduce the total organic compound emissions, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants emissions vented to the control device of 95 percent by weight or greater or achieve an outlet total organic compound concentration, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent. The 20 parts per million by volume performance standard is not applicable to compliance with the provisions of § 63.134 or § 63.135 of this subpart.

(3) A flare shall comply with the requirements of § 63.11(b) of subpart A of this part.

(4) A scrubber, alone or in combination with other control devices, shall reduce the total organic compound emissions, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants emissions in such a manner that 95 weight-percent is either removed, or destroyed by chemical reaction with the scrubbing liquid or achieve an outlet total organic compound concentration, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent. The 20 parts per million by volume performance standard is not applicable to compliance with the provisions of § 63.134 or § 63.135 of this subpart.

(5) Any other control device used shall, alone or in combination with other control devices, reduce the total organic compound emissions, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants emissions vented to the control device by 95 percent by weight or greater or achieve an outlet total organic compound concentration, less methane and ethane, or total organic hazardous air pollutants concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent. The 20 parts per million by volume performance standard is not applicable to compliance with the provisions of § 63.134 or § 63.135 of this subpart.

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, an owner or operator shall demonstrate that each control device or combination of control devices achieves the appropriate conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section by using one or more of the methods specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section.

(1) Performance tests conducted using the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.145(i) of this subpart for control devices other than flares; or

(2) A design evaluation that addresses the vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(vii) of this section.

(i) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flow rate and shall establish the design minimum and average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone residence time.

(ii) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flow rate and shall establish the design minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.

(iii) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, and flow rate; shall establish the design minimum and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time; and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone.

(iv) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design outlet organic compound concentration level, design average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet.

(v) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly on-site in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon.

(vi) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly on-site in the control device such as a carbon canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, mass or volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.

(vii) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition; constituent concentrations; liquid-to-vapor ratio; scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration; temperature; and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and will include the additional information in paragraphs (d)(2)(vii)(A) and (d)(2)(vii)(B) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.

(A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;

(B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed section.

(3) For flares, the compliance determination specified in § 63.11(b) of subpart A of this part and § 63.145(j) of this subpart.

(4) An owner or operator using any control device specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iv) of this section is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section and from the requirements in § 63.6(f) of subpart A of this part, and from the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

(i) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater.

(ii) A boiler or process heater into which the emission stream is introduced with the primary fuel.

(iii) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:

(A) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H, or

(B) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.

(iv) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.

(e) The owner or operator of a control device that is used to comply with the provisions of this section shall monitor the control device in accordance with § 63.143 of this subpart.

(f) Except as provided in § 63.140 of this subpart, if gaps, cracks, tears, or holes are observed in ductwork, piping, or connections to covers and control devices during an inspection, a first effort to repair shall be made as soon as practical but no later than 5 calendar days after identification. Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after identification or discovery of the defect.
