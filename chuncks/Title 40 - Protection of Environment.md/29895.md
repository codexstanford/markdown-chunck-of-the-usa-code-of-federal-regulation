###### Monitoring and Compliance Provisions
####### § 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Documentation required.

(iv)(A) The alternative standard petition you submit under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(A) of this section must include data or information documenting that raw material contributions to emissions prevent you from complying with the emission standard even though the source is using MACT, as defined in paragraphs (b)(10)(viii) and (ix) of this section, for the standard for which you are seeking relief.

(B) Alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section must include data or information documenting that mercury is not present at detectable levels in raw materials.

(v) You must include data or information with semivolatile metal and low volatile metal alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(A) of this section documenting that increased chlorine feedrates associated with the burning of hazardous waste, when compared to non-hazardous waste operations, do not significantly increase metal emissions attributable to raw materials.

(vi) You must include data or information with semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas alternative standard petitions that you submit under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(A) of this section documenting that emissions of the regulated metals and hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas attributable to the hazardous waste only will not exceed the emission standards in this subpart.

(vii) You must not operate pursuant to your recommended alternative standards in lieu of emission standards specified in this subpart:

(A) Unless the Administrator approves the provisions of the alternative standard petition request or establishes other alternative standards; and

(B) Until you submit a revised Notification of Compliance that incorporates the revised standards.

(viii) For purposes of this alternative standard provision, MACT for existing hazardous waste burning cement kilns is defined as:

(A) For mercury, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 88 µg/dscm or less;

(B) For semivolatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 31,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed or less;

(C) For low volatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 54,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed or less; and

(D) For hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas, a hazardous waste chlorine feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 720,000 µgm/dscm or less.

(ix) For purposes of this alternative standard provision, MACT for new hazardous waste burning cement kilns is defined as:

(A) For mercury, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 7 µg/dscm or less;

(B) For semivolatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 31,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed or less;

(C) For low volatile metals, a hazardous waste feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 15,000 µg/dscm or less, and use of a particulate matter control device that achieves particulate matter emissions of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed or less;

(D) For hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas, a hazardous waste chlorine feedrate corresponding to an MTEC of 420,000 µgm/dscm or less.
