####### Alternative inspection and monitoring interval.

(d)Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a piece of air pollution control equipment in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as "unsafe to inspect and monitor." The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.

(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.
