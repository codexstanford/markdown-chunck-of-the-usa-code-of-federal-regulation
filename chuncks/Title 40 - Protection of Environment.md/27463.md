####### Flare tip velocity.

(d)For each flare, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, provided the appropriate monitoring systems are in-place, whenever regulated material is routed to the flare for at least 15-minutes and the flare vent gas flow rate is less than the smokeless design capacity of the flare.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the actual flare tip velocity (V) must be less than 60 feet per second. The owner or operator shall monitor Vusing the procedures specified in paragraphs (i) and (k) of this section.

(2) Vmust be less than 400 feet per second and also less than the maximum allowed flare tip velocity (V) as calculated according to the following equation. The owner or operator shall monitor Vusing the procedures specified in paragraphs (i) and (k) of this section and monitor gas composition and determine NHVusing the procedures specified in paragraphs (j) and (l) of this section.
