####### OBD monitoring requirements for all engines,Engine cooling system monitoring,General.

(i)-(1)-(i)(A) The OBD system must monitor the thermostat on engines so equipped for proper operation.

(B) The OBD system must monitor the engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor for electrical circuit continuity, out-of-range values, and rationality malfunctions.

(C) For engines that use a system other than the cooling system and ECT sensor (e.g., oil temperature, cylinder head temperature) to determine engine operating temperature for emission control purposes (e.g., to modify spark or fuel injection timing or quantity), the manufacturer may forego cooling system monitoring and instead monitor the components or systems used in their approach. To do so, the manufacturer must to submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that their monitoring plan is as reliable and effective as the monitoring required in this paragraph (i)(1).
