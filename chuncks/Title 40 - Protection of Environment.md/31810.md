(ii) At a new affected source, an owner or operator may designate no more than 3 percent of valves as difficult-to-monitor.

(iii) The owner or operator of valves, agitators, or pumps designated as difficult-to-monitor must have a written plan that requires monitoring of the equipment at least once per calendar year or on the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable to the group of processes in which the equipment is located, whichever is less frequent.
