####### Data analysis.

(7)The data recorded during the calibration are to be used in the following calculations:

(i) The air flow rate, Q, at each test point is calculated from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.

(ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test point:

(A) Q= Flow rate in m/minute, standard conditions are 20 &#xB0;C, 101.3 kPa (68 &#xB0;F, 29.92 in. Hg)

(B) T= Temperature at venturi inlet, &#xB0;K(&#xB0;R).
