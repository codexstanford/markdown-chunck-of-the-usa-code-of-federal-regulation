####### Proportional or constant flow rate.,M.,m.,m,m

(ii)If you batch sample from a constant exhaust flow rate, extract a sample at a proportional or constant flow rate. We consider the following to be examples of constant exhaust flows: CVS diluted exhaust with a CVS flow meter that has either an upstream heat exchanger, electronic flow control, or both. Determine the mean molar flow rate from which you extracted the sample. Multiply the mean concentration of the batch sample by the mean molar flow rate of the exhaust from which the sample was extracted to determine the total emission and multiply the result by the time of the test interval. If the total emission is a molar quantity, convert this quantity to a mass by multiplying it by its molar mass,The result is the total emission mass,In the case of PM emissions, where the mean PM concentration is already in units of mass per mole of exhaust, simply multiply it by the total flow, and the result is the total mass of PM,Calculatefor each constituent as follows:
