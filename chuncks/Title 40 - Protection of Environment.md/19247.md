####### End finisher

means a polymerization reaction vessel operated under very low pressures, typically at pressures of 2 mm Hg (1 in. HO) or less, in order to produce high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate). An end finisher is preceded in a high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line by one or more polymerization vessels operated under less severe vacuums, typically between 5 and 10 mm Hg (3 and 5 in. HO). A high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line may have one or more end finishers.
