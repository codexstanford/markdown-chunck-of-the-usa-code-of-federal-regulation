###### ยง 158.100 Pesticide use patterns.
####### General use patterns for conventional, biochemical, and microbial pesticides.

(a)There are six broad use categories used in the data tables. The six broad categories include terrestrial outdoor uses, aquatic outdoor uses, greenhouse uses, forestry uses, residential outdoor uses, and indoor uses of all types. The 6 broad use categories are further subdivided into 12 general use patterns which are the bases for data requirements established by use pattern. Within the data tables, general use patterns have been combined into single columns when the data requirements are the same for the combined uses. If there are no data requirements for a specific use, the column for that use is not included in the table. The 12 general use pattern groups used in the data table in this part are:

(1) Terrestrial food crop use.

(2) Terrestrial feed crop use.

(3) Terrestrial nonfood crop use.

(4) Aquatic food crop use.

(5) Aquatic nonfood use.

(6) Greenhouse food crop use.
