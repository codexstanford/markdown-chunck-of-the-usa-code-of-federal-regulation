Refer to section 1.3 of Method 7E.

In this method, you continuously or intermittently sample the effluent gas and convey the sample to an analyzer that measures the concentration of CO. You must meet the performance requirements of this method to validate your data.

Refer to section 3.0 of Method 7E for the applicable definitions.

Substances having a strong absorption of infrared energy may interfere to some extent in some analyzers. Instrumental correction may be used to compensate for the interference. You may also use silica gel and ascarite traps to eliminate the interferences. If this option is used, correct the measured gas volume for the carbon dioxide (CO) removed in the trap.

Refer to section 5.0 of Method 7E.
