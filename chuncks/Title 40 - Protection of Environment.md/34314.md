######## Monthly average organic HAP content of all coating materials as-applied is less than the mass fraction of coating solids limit (ยง 63.3320(b)(3)).

(4)Demonstrate that the monthly average as-applied organic HAP content on the basis of coating solids applied of all coating materials applied at an existing affected source is less than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied, and all coating materials applied at a new affected source are less than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied, as determined by Equation 9:

(5) The affected source is in compliance with emission standards in ยง 63.3320(b)(2) or (3) if:

(i) The organic HAP content of each coating material as-applied at an existing affected source is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg coating material or 0.2 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids, and the organic HAP content of each coating material as-applied at a new affected source contains no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg coating material or 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids; or

(ii) The monthly average organic HAP content of all as-applied coating materials at an existing affected source are no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg coating material or 0.2 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids, and the monthly average organic HAP content of all as-applied coating materials at a new affected source is no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg coating material or 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids.
