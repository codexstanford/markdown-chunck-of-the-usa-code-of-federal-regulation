####### ยง 63.1215 What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total chlorine?
######## Definition of eligibility.

(2)(i) Eligibility for the risk-based total chlorine standard is determined by comparing the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for the total chlorine emission rate you select for each combustor to the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.

(ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit ensures that the Hazard Index for chronic exposure from HCl and chlorine emissions from all on-site hazardous waste combustors is less than or equal to 1.0, rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), for the actual individual most exposed to the facility's emissions, considering off-site locations where people reside and where people congregate for work, school, or recreation.

(iii) Your facility is eligible for the health-based compliance alternative for total chlorine if either:

(A) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site hazardous waste combustor is below the appropriate value in the look-up table determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or

(B) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site hazardous waste combustor is below the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit you calculate based on a site-specific compliance demonstration under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
