(b)Prior to its introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be determined by the following procedure:

(1) Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate the internal volume. For variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at a constant temperature; this nominal volume shall be repeatable within +/-0.5 percent of the reported value.
