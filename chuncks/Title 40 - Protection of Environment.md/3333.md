means a source, not including the exempt emissions units and activities listed in § 49.153(c), that emits or has the potential to emit regulated NSR pollutants in amounts that are less than the major source thresholds in § 49.167 or § 52.21 of this chapter, as applicable, but equal to or greater than the minor NSR thresholds in § 49.153, without the need to take an enforceable restriction to reduce its potential to emit to such levels.
