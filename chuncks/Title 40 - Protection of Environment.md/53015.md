(iii) Any facility that destroys fluorinated GHGs or fluorinated HTFs but does not produce or import fluorinated GHGs must submit the one-time destruction report by March 31, 2019 or within 60 days of commencing fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF destruction, whichever is later.

(c) Each bulk importer of fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide shall submit an annual report that summarizes its imports at the corporate level, except for shipments including less than twenty-five kilograms of fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide, transshipments, and heels that meet the conditions set forth at § 98.417(e). The report shall contain the following information for each import:

(1) Total mass in metric tons of nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF imported in bulk, including each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF constituent of the fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF product that makes up between 0.5 percent and 100 percent of the product by mass.

(2) Total mass in metric tons of nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF imported in bulk and sold or transferred to persons other than the importer for use in processes resulting in the transformation or destruction of the chemical.

(3) Date on which the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide were imported.

(4) Port of entry through which the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide passed.

(5) Country from which the imported fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide were imported.

(6) Commodity code of the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide shipped.

(7) Importer number for the shipment.

(8) Total mass in metric tons of each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF destroyed by the importer.

(9) If applicable, the names and addresses of the persons and facilities to which the nitrous oxide, fluorinated GHGs, or fluorinated HTFs were sold or transferred for transformation, and the quantities (metric tons) of nitrous oxide and of each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF that were sold or transferred to each facility for transformation.

(10) If applicable, the names and addresses of the persons and facilities to which the fluorinated GHGs or fluorinated HTFs were sold or transferred for destruction, and the quantities (metric tons) of each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF that were sold or transferred to each facility for destruction.

(d) Each bulk exporter of fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide shall submit an annual report that summarizes its exports at the corporate level, except for shipments including less than twenty-five kilograms of fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide, transshipments, and heels. The report shall contain the following information for each export:

(1) Total mass in metric tons of nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF exported in bulk.

(2) Names and addresses of the exporter and the recipient of the exports.

(3) Exporter's Employee Identification Number.

(4) Commodity code of the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide shipped.

(5) Date on which, and the port from which, the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide were exported from the United States or its territories.

(6) Country to which the fluorinated GHGs, fluorinated HTFs, or nitrous oxide were exported.

(e) By March 31, 2011, or within 60 days of commencing fluorinated GHG production, whichever is later, a fluorinated GHG production facility shall submit a one-time report describing the following information:

(1) The method(s) by which the producer in practice measures the mass of fluorinated GHGs produced, including the instrumentation used (Coriolis flowmeter, other flowmeter, weigh scale, etc.) and its accuracy and precision.

(2) The method(s) by which the producer in practice estimates the mass of fluorinated GHGs fed into the transformation process, including the instrumentation used (Coriolis flowmeter, other flowmeter, weigh scale, etc.) and its accuracy and precision.

(3) The method(s) by which the producer in practice estimates the fraction of fluorinated GHGs fed into the transformation process that is actually transformed, and the estimated precision and accuracy of this estimate.

(4) The method(s) by which the producer in practice estimates the masses of fluorinated GHGs fed into the destruction device, including the method(s) used to estimate the concentration of the fluorinated GHGs in the destroyed material, and the estimated precision and accuracy of this estimate.

(5) The estimated percent efficiency of each production process for the fluorinated GHG produced.

(f) By March 31, 2011, all fluorinated GHG production facilities shall submit a one-time report that includes the concentration of each fluorinated GHG constituent in each fluorinated GHG product as measured under § 98.414(n). If the facility commences production of a fluorinated GHG product that was not included in the initial report or performs a repeat measurement under § 98.414(n) that shows that the identities or concentrations of the fluorinated GHG constituents of a fluorinated GHG product have changed, then the new or changed concentrations, as well as the date of the change, must be reflected in a revision to the report. The revised report must be submitted to EPA by the March 31st that immediately follows the measurement under § 98.414(n).

(g) Isolated intermediates that are produced and transformed at the same facility are exempt from the reporting requirements of this section.

(h) Low-concentration constituents are exempt from the reporting requirements of this section.

(i) Each facility that destroys fluorinated GHGs or fluorinated HTFs but does not otherwise report under this section shall report the mass in metric tons of each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF that is destroyed at that facility and that was previously produced as defined at § 98.410(b) or (d), as applicable. Quantities to be reported under this paragraph (i) include but are not limited to quantities that are shipped to the facility by another facility for destruction and quantities that are returned to the facility for reclamation but are found to be irretrievably contaminated and are therefore destroyed.

(j) By March 31, 2019, all facilities that produce fluorinated HTFs that are not also fluorinated GHGs shall submit a one-time report that includes the concentration of each fluorinated HTF or fluorinated GHG constituent in each fluorinated HTF product as measured under § 98.414(n). If the facility commences production of a fluorinated HTF product that was not included in the initial report or performs a repeat measurement under § 98.414(n) that shows that the identities or concentrations of the fluorinated HTF or fluorinated GHG constituents of a fluorinated HTF product have changed, then the new or changed concentrations, as well as the date of the change, must be provided in a revised report. The revised report must be submitted to EPA by the March 31st that immediately follows the new or repeat measurement under § 98.414(n).
