####### Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System or Hg CEMS

3.1.1means all of the equipment used to continuously determine the total vapor phase Hg concentration. The measurement system may include the following major subsystems: sample acquisition, Hgto Hgconverter, sample transport, sample conditioning, flow control/gas manifold, gas analyzer, and data acquisition and handling system (DAHS). Hg CEMS may be nominally real-time or time-integrated, batch sampling systems that sample the gas on an intermittent basis and concentrate on a collection medium before intermittent analysis and reporting.
