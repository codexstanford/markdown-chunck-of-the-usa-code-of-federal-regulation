Instructions: Table 1 of this appendix provides the list of data sources and minimum submission frequencies for the ten different NPDES Data Groups. Table 2 of this appendix provides the data that must be electronically reported for each of these NPDES Data Groups. The use of each data element is determined by identifying the number(s) in the column labeled "NPDES Data Group Number" in Table 2 and finding the corresponding "NPDES Data Group Number" in Table 1. For example, a value of "1" in Table 2 means that this data element is required in the electronic transmission of data from the NPDES program to EPA (Core NPDES Permitting, Compliance, and Enforcement Data). Likewise, a value of "1 through 10" in Table 2 means that this data element is required in all ten NPDES data groups. NPDES regulated entities that have no historical record ("greenfield" facilities) do not need to provide data elements that rely on historical data elements. For the purposes of this appendix, the term `sewage sludge' [see 40 CFR 503.9(w)] also refers to the material that is commonly referred to as `biosolids.' EPA does not have a regulatory definition for biosolids but this material is commonly referred to as sewage sludge that is placed on, or applied to the land to use the beneficial properties of the material as a soil amendment, conditioner, or fertilizer. EPA's use of the term `biosolids' in this appendix is to confirm that information about beneficially used sewage sludge (a.k.a. biosolids) is part of the data collected in this appendix.
