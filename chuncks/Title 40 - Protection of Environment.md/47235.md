###### § 86.612-97 Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.
####### Provided,

(2) After implementing the change(s) intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate, if the certificate was revoked pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, that the modified vehicle configuration does in fact conform with the requirements of this subpart by testing vehicles selected from normal production runs of that modified vehicle configuration in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order pursuant to § 86.603. The Administrator shall consider this testing to satisfy the testing requirements of § 86.079-32 or § 86.079-33 if the Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If the subsequent testing results in a pass decision pursuant to the criteria in § 86.610-98(c), the Administrator shall reissue or amend the certificate, if necessary, to include that configuration:that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit results in a fail decision pursuant to the criteria in § 86.610-98(c), the revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the modification of the configuration specified by the test order.

(i) A manufacturer may at any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity with respect to a test vehicle pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than fifteen (15) days or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c) or (e) of this section, request that the Administrator grant such manufacturer a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.

(j) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section or notifies a manufacturer of his intent to suspend, revoke or void a certificate of conformity under § 86.007-30(e) or § 86.1850, and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 86.614, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.

(k) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test vehicles when conducting testing of an engine family or configuration subsequent to suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that engine family or configuration pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of this section, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that engine family or configuration. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the manufacturer consents to recall all vehicles of that engine family or configuration produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the engine family or configuration fails the subsequent testing and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.
