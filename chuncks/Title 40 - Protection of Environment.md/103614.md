######## Sulfur tracking.

(iii)Generate a fuel sulfur exposure line describing the relationship between aging hours and cumulative target sulfur exposure mass. The control limits for sulfur exposure are +/-3%. Log actual fuel consumption and the measured fuel sulfur level of the current batch of fuel (if you are doping fuel to accelerate sulfur exposure) for engine stand aging. Use these measurements to ensure that sulfur exposure remains within the control limits. Adjust sulfur doping levels in the fuel from batch to batch as needed to stay within limits. If you use gaseous SOfor sulfur acceleration, monitor the mass flow rate of the gaseous sulfur. Use these measurements to calculate total sulfur mass exposure, and correct SOgas flow rates as needed to stay within the control limits.
