##### ยง 1043.41 EIAPP certification process.

This section describes the process for obtaining the EIAPP certificate required by ยง 1043.40.

(a) You must send the Designated Certification Officer a separate application for an EIAPP certificate for each engine family. An EIAPP certificate is valid starting with the indicated effective date and is valid for any production until such time as the design of the engine family changes or more stringent emission standards become applicable, whichever comes first. Note that an EIAPP certificate demonstrating compliance with Tier I or Tier II standards (but not the Tier III standard) is only a limited authorization to install engines on vessels. For example, you may produce such Tier I or Tier II engines, but those engines may not be installed in vessels that are subject to Tier III standards. You may obtain preliminary approval of portions of the application under 40 CFR 1042.210.
