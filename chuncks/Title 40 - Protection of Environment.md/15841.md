######## Particle concentration measurements.

(e)All measurements of particle concentration must be made such that the relative error in measurement is less than 5.0 percent. Relative error is defined as (s x 100 percent)/(X), where s is the sample standard deviation of the particle concentration detector, X is the measured concentration, and the units of s and X are identical.
