####### ยง 53.64 Test procedure: Static fractionator test.
######## Overview.

(a)This test applies only to those candidate methods in which the sole deviation from the reference method is in the design of the 2.5-micron fractionation device. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the fractionation characteristics of the candidate fractionator are acceptably similar to that of the reference method sampler. It is recognized that various methodologies exist for quantifying fractionator effectiveness. The following commonly-employed techniques are provided for purposes of guidance. Other methodologies for determining sampler effectiveness may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.
