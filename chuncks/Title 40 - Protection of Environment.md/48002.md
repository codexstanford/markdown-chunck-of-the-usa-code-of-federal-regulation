####### Manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing.

(b)(1) If the Administrator determines not to conduct a confirmatory test under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, manufacturers of light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and/or medium-duty passenger vehicles will conduct a confirmatory test at their facility after submitting the original test data to the Administrator whenever any of the conditions listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section exist, and complete heavy-duty vehicles manufacturers will conduct a confirmatory test at their facility after submitting the original test data to the Administrator whenever the conditions listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section exist, as follows:

(i) The vehicle configuration has previously failed an emission standard;

(ii) The test exhibits high emission levels determined by exceeding a percentage of the standards specified by the Administrator for that model year;

(iii) The fuel economy value of the test as measured in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 600 is higher than expected based on procedures approved by the Administrator;

(iv) The fuel economy value as measured in accordance with the procedures in part 600 of this title, is close to a Gas Guzzler Tax threshold value based on tolerances established by the Administrator for that model year; or

(v) The fuel economy value as measured in accordance with the procedures in part 600 of this title, is a potential fuel economy leader for a class of vehicles based on Administrator provided cut points for that model year.

(vi) The exhaust carbon-related exhaust emissions of the test as measured in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 600 are lower than expected based on procedures approved by the Administrator.

(2) If the Administrator selects the vehicle for confirmatory testing based on the manufacturer's original test results, the testing shall be conducted as ordered by the Administrator. In this case, the manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section would not be required.

(3) For light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles the manufacturer shall conduct a retest of the FTP or highway test if the difference between the fuel economy of the confirmatory test and the original manufacturer's test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage to be applied consistently to all manufacturer conducted confirmatory testing as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator).

(i) For use in the fuel economy and exhaust greenhouse gas fleet averaging program described in 40 CFR parts 86 and 600, the manufacturer may, in lieu of conducting a retest, accept as official the lower of the original and confirmatory test fuel economy results, and by doing so will also accept as official the calculated CREE value associated with the lower fuel economy test results.

(ii) The manufacturer shall conduct a second retest of the FTP or highway test if the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the original manufacturer test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator) and the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the first confirmatory test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator). In lieu of conducting a second retest, the manufacturer may accept as official (for use in the fuel economy program and the exhaust greenhouse gas fleet averaging program) the lowest fuel economy of the original test, the first confirmatory test, and the second confirmatory test fuel economy results, and by doing so will also accept as official the calculated CREE value associated with the lowest fuel economy test results.
