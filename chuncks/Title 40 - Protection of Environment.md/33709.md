######## Continuous compliance requirements.

(d)You must calculate annual rolling average values of the HAP and VOC factors (annual factors) in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section. To show continuous compliance, the annual factors must be equal to or less than the target annual factors calculated according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(1) To calculate the annual factors, you must divide the consumption of both total HAP and total VOC by the production rate, per process, for 12-month periods at the frequency specified in either paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.

(2) For continuous processes, you must calculate the annual factors every 30 days for the 12-month period preceding the 30th day (i.e., annual rolling average calculated every 30 days). A process with both batch and continuous operations is considered a continuous process for the purposes of this section.
