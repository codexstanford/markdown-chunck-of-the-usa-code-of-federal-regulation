####### Test for precision.

(k)(1) Calculate the precision (P) of the analysis (in percent) for each filter and for each method, as the maximum minus the minimum divided by the average of the three concentration values, using equation 4 or equation 5 of this section:

(2) If a direct reading candidate method is tested, the precision is determined from collocated devices using equation 5 above.

(3) If any reference method precision value (P) exceeds 15 percent, the precision of the reference method analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the source(s) of imprecision, and the reference method determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (g) of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph (e) of this section) must be repeated.

(4) If any candidate method precision value (P) exceeds 15 percent, the candidate method fails the precision test.
