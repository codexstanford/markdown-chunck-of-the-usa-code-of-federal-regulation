###### ยง 1066.140 Diluted exhaust flow calibration.
####### CFV calibration.,K,r

(h)The calibration procedure described in this paragraph (h) establishes the value of the calibration coefficient,, at measured values of pressure, temperature and air flow. Calibrate the CFV up to the highest expected pressure ratio,, according to ยง 1066.625. Calibrate the CFV as follows:

(1) Configure your calibration system as shown in Figure 1 of this section.

(2) Verify that any leaks between the calibration flow meter and the CFV are less than 0.3% of the total flow at the highest restriction.

(3) Start the blower downstream of the CFV.
