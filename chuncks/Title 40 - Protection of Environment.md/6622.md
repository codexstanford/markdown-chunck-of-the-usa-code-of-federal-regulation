###### Calibration Gases.

3.3For nitrogen oxides monitoring systems installed on fossil fuel-fired steam generators, the pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas mixtures (section 6.1, Performance Specification 2, appendix B, part 60 of this chapter) shall be nitric oxide (NO). For nitrogen oxides monitoring systems installed on nitric acid plants, the pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas mixtures (section 6.1, Performance Specification 2, appendix B, part 60 of this chapter) shall be nitrogen dioxide (NO). These gases shall also be used for daily checks under paragraph 3.7 of this appendix as applicable. For sulfur dioxide monitoring systems installed on fossil fuel-fired steam generators or sulfuric acid plants, the pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas mixtures (section 6.1, Performance Specification 2, appendix B, part 60 of this chapter) shall be sulfur dioxide (SO). Span and zero gases should be traceable to National Bureau of Standards reference gases whenever these reference gases are available. Every 6 months from date of manufacture, span and zero gases shall be reanalyzed by conducting triplicate analyses using the reference methods in appendix A, part 60 of this chapter as follows: for SOuse Reference Method 6; for nitrogen oxides, use Reference Method 7; and for carbon dioxide or oxygen, use Reference Method 3. The gases may be analyzed at less frequent intervals if longer shelf lives are guaranteed by the manufacturer.
