###### Field test for orientation sensitivity.

5.1.4If a velocity measurement system is either a single point measurement device or a pressure sensor or any other device such as pitot tube which uses the flow direction of the test gas, then the following test shall be followed and a performance specification of +/-10 degrees device orientation sensitivity for +/-4 percent flow rate determination accuracy must be met in order for the measurement system to be considered acceptable under this method. This is in addition to the performance specifications given in paragraph 4 of this appendix. During a period of relatively steady state gas flow, perform the following orientation test using the measurement system. The system should be continuously measuring gas velocity at all times. Rotate the measurement 10&#xB0; on each side of the direction of flow in increments of 5&#xB0;. Perform this test three times each at:

(1) Maximum operating velocity (+/-15 percent);

(2) 67 percent +/-7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity; and

(3) 33 percent +/-7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity if (2) and (3) are normal operating practices.
