###### § 60.615 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to § 60.612 shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.612 (§ 60.612 (a) (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial start-up required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.612 with which he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as specified by § 60.614 within 180 days.

(b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of the following data measured during each performance test, and also include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to comply with § 60.612(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information of § 60.615(b)(2)(i) is required. The same data specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a control device, outlet concentration of TOC, or the TRE index value of a vent stream from a recovery system is determined.

(1) Where an owner or operator subject to this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) through use of either a thermal or catalytic incinerator:

(i) The average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing, and

(ii) The percent reduction of TOC determined as specified in § 60.614(b) achieved by the incinerator, or the concentration of TOC (ppmv, by compound) determined as specified in § 60.614(b) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.

(2) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) through use of a boiler or process heater:

(i) A description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater, and

(ii) The average combustion temperature of the boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing.

(3) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to comply with § 60.612(b) through the use of a smokeless flare, flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted, or nonassisted), all visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test, continuous records of the flare pilot flame monitoring, and records of all periods of operations during which the pilot flame is absent.

(4) Where an owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(c):

(i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter which is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation, if approved by the Administrator), and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), or

(ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature, measured at least every 15 minutes and average over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

(iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the total steam mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance test (full carbon bed cycle), temperature of the carbon bed after regeneration (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle(s), and duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle (all measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), or

(iv) As an alternative to § 60.615(b)(4)(i), (ii) or (iii), the concentration level or reading indicated by the organic monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

(v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.

(c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.613(a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion device is used by an owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) or (c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:

(1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined.

(2) For catalytic incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature of the vent stream immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average temperature of the vent stream during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined. The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined.

(3) All 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined for boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr).

(4) For boilers or process heaters, whenever there is a change in the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone as required under § 60.612(a).

(d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the flow indication specified under § 60.613(a)(2), § 60.613(b)(2), and § 60.613(c)(1), as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or has no flow rate.

(e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart who uses a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater to comply with § 60.612(a) shall keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of all periods of operation of the boiler or process heater. (Examples of such records could include records of steam use, fuel use, or monitoring data collected pursuant to other State or Federal regulatory requirements).

(f) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the flare pilot flame monitoring specified in § 60.613(b), as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of all periods of operations in which the pilot flame is absent.

The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:

(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, and where an organic monitoring device is not used:
