(d)On and after the compliance date established by § 63.1501:

(1) The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere emissions in excess of:

(i) 0.03 kg of THC, as propane, per Mg (0.06 lb of THC, as propane, per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(ii) 0.04 kg of PM per Mg (0.08 lb per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(iii) 0.25 µg of D/F TEQ per Mg (3.5 x 10gr of D/F TEQ per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major or area source; and

(iv) 0.40 kg of HCl per Mg (0.80 lb per ton) of feed/charge from a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source.

(2) The owner or operator of a scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere visible emissions in excess of 10 percent opacity from any PM add-on air pollution control device if a COM is chosen as the monitoring option.
