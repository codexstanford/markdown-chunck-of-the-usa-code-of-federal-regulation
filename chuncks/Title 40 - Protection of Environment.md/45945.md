######## Averaging sets for particulate emission credits.

(e)The averaging and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set. The averaging sets for the averaging and trading of particulate emission credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:

(1) Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading between diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.

(2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle engines, as defined in ยง 86.004-2, constitute an averaging set. Averaging and trading between diesel-cycle engine families within the same primary service class is allowed.

(3) Otto cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, trading, or banking.
