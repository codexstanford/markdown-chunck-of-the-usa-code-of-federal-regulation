####### § 51.1004 Attainment dates.

(a) The state shall submit a projected attainment date as part of its attainment plan submission under § 51.1003 for any PMNAAQS nonattainment area located in whole or in part within its boundaries. The state shall justify the projected attainment date for each such nonattainment area (or portion of a nonattainment area) as part of the demonstration of attainment developed and submitted according to the requirements set forth at § 51.1011 and according to the following:

(1) Nonattainment areas initially classified as Moderate.

(i) Except for nonattainment areas that meet the criterion under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the projected attainment date for a Moderate PMnonattainment area shall be as expeditious as practicable through the implementation of all control measures required under § 51.1009. The attainment date may be as late as the end of the sixth calendar year after the effective date of designation if the state demonstrates that the implementation of the control measures that qualify as RACM, RACT, and additional reasonable measures, but that are not necessary for demonstrating attainment by the end of the sixth calendar year after the effective date of designation, will not collectively advance the attainment date by at least 1 year.

(ii) The projected attainment date for a Moderate PMnonattainment area which the state demonstrates cannot practicably attain the applicable PMNAAQS by the end of the sixth calendar year after the effective date of designation of the area with the implementation of all control measures required under § 51.1009 shall be the end of the sixth calendar year after the effective date of designation unless and until the area is reclassified as Serious according to § 51.1002.
