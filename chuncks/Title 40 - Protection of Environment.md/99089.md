###### Revision of the number of vehicles or engines covered by the certificate.

(c)(1) You must take both of the following steps if the number of vehicles or engines to be produced or imported under the certificate exceeds the number indicated on the certificate (including a certificate under which modification and test vehicles are imported under 40 CFR 85.1509 and 89.609):

(i) Request that we revise the certificate with a number that indicates the new projection of the vehicles or engines to be covered by the certificate. We must issue the revised certificate before the additional number of vehicles or engines may be sold or finally imported into the United States.

(ii) Submit payment of 1.0% of the aggregate projected retail sales price of all the additional vehicles or engines.

(2) You must receive a revised certificate before the sale or final importation of any vehicles or engines, including modification and test vehicles, that are not originally included in the certificate issued under paragraph (b) of this section, or as indicated in a revised certificate issued under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Such vehicles that are sold or imported before we issue a revised certificate are deemed to be not covered by a certificate of conformity.
