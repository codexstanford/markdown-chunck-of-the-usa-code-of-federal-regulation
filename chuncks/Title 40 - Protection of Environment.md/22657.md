(1) You must use the reference method for PM (usually EPA Methods 5, 5I, or 17) that is prescribed by the applicable regulations. You may need to perform other reference methods or performance specifications (Method 3 for oxygen, Method 4 for moisture, etc.) depending on the units in which your PM CEMS reports PM concentration.

(i) We recommend that you use paired reference method trains when collecting manual PM data to identify and screen the reference method data for imprecision and bias. Procedures for checking reference method data for bias and precision can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5).
