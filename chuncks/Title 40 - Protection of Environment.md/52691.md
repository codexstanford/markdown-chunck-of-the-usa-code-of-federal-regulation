####### Sub-basin category, for onshore natural gas production,

means a subdivision of a basin into the unique combination of wells with the surface coordinates within the boundaries of an individual county and subsurface completion in one or more of each of the following five formation types: Oil, high permeability gas, shale gas, coal seam, or other tight gas reservoir rock. The distinction between high permeability gas and tight gas reservoirs shall be designated as follows: High permeability gas reservoirs with >0.1 millidarcy permeability, and tight gas reservoirs with &#x2264;0.1 millidarcy permeability. Permeability for a reservoir type shall be determined by engineering estimate. Wells that produce only from high permeability gas, shale gas, coal seam, or other tight gas reservoir rock are considered gas wells; gas wells producing from more than one of these formation types shall be classified into only one type based on the formation with the most contribution to production as determined by engineering knowledge. All wells that produce hydrocarbon liquids (with or without gas) and do not meet the definition of a gas well in this sub-basin category definition are considered to be in the oil formation. All emission sources that handle condensate from gas wells in high permeability gas, shale gas, or tight gas reservoir rock formations are considered to be in the formation that the gas well belongs to and not in the oil formation.
