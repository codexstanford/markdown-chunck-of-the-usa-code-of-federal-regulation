###### ยง 98.263 Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process COemissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the process COemissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(1) Calculate the annual COmass emissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using the methods in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.

(i) If your process measurement provides the inorganic carbon content of phosphate rock as an output, calculate and report the process COemissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using Equation Z-1a of this section:

(ii) If your process measurement provides the COcontent directly as an output, calculate and report the process COemissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using Equation Z-1b of this section:

(2) You must determine the total emissions from the facility using Equation Z-2 of this section:

(c) If GHG emissions from a wet-process phosphoric acid process line are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports COemissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
