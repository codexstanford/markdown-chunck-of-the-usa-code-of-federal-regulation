####### ยง 1065.269 Photoacoustic analyzer for ethanol and methanol.
######## Component requirements.

(b)We recommend that you use a photoacoustic analyzer that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your photoacoustic system must meet the verification in ยง 1065.369 and it must also meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307. Use an optical wheel configuration that gives analytical priority to measurement of the least stable components in the sample. Select a sample integration time of at least 5 seconds. Take into account sample chamber and sample line volumes when determining flush times for your instrument.
