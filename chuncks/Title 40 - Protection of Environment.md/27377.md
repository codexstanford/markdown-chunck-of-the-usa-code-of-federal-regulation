() Method 305 of appendix A of this part may be used to determine C, the average volatile organic HAP concentration of organic HAP m in wastewater stream i, and then HAPmay be calculated using the following equation: HAP= C/Fm, where Fmfor organic HAP m is obtained from table 7 of this subpart.

(B) Values for Q, HAP, and Cshall be determined during a performance test conducted under representative conditions. The average value obtained from three test runs shall be used. The values of Q, HAP, and Cshall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status report and must be updated as provided in paragraph (h)(6)(i)(C) of this section.

(C) If there is a change to the process or operation such that the previously measured values of Q, HAP, and Care no longer representative, a new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative values of Q, HAP, and C. These new values shall be used to calculate debits and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.

(iii) The following equations shall be used to calculate EWW1for each Group 1 wastewater stream i that is correctly suppressed and is treated to a level more stringent than the reference control technology.

(A) If the Group 1 wastewater stream i is controlled using a treatment process or series of treatment processes with an approved nominal reduction efficiency for an individually speciated HAP that is greater than that specified in table 7 of this subpart, and the vapor control device achieves a percentage of reduction equal to 95 percent, the following equation shall be used:

(B) If the Group 1 wastewater stream i is not controlled using a treatment process or series of treatment processes with an approved nominal reduction efficiency for an individually speciated HAP that is greater than that specified in table 7 of this subpart, but the vapor control device has an approved nominal efficiency greater than 95 percent, the following equation shall be used:
