####### Requirements for equipment manufacturers.

(f)If you produce equipment with engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 of Table 3 of § 1039.102 during model years from 2008 through 2011, then a minimum number of pieces of equipment you produce using 2012 model year engines must have engines certified to the Option #2 standards, as follows:

(1) For equipment you produce with 2012 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW, determine the minimum number of these engines that must be certified to the Option #2 standards in Table 3 of § 1039.102 as follows:

(i) If all the equipment you produce using 2008 through 2011 model year engines use engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 of Table 3 of § 1039.102, then all the 2012 model year engines you install must be certified to the Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102.

(ii) If you produce equipment using 2008 through 2011 model year engines with some engines certified to Option #1 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102 and some engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102, calculate the minimum number of 2012 model year engines you must install that are certified to the Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102 from the following equation:

(2) As needed for the calculation required by this paragraph (f), keep records of all equipment you produce using 2008-2012 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW. If you fail to keep these records, you may not use any 2012 model year engines certified to Option #1 standards in your equipment.

(3) If you fail to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (f), then using 2012 model year engines certified under Option #1 of Table 3 of § 1039.102 (or certified to less stringent standards) in such equipment violates the prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1).
