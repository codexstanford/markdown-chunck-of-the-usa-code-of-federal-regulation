(iii) For linearity verification of a fuel mass scale,is determined based on the range of engines and test interval durations expected during testing. It is the minimum, over all engines expected during testing, of the fuel consumption expected over the minimum test interval duration at the engine's maximum fuel rate. If the minimum test interval duration used during testing does not change with engine power or if the minimum test interval duration used during testing increases with engine power,is given by Eq. 1065.307-1. Calculateusing the following equation:
