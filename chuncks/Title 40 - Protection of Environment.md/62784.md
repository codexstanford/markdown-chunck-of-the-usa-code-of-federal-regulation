####### Interstate Commerce

(n)means the commerce between any place in a State and any place in another State, or between places in the same State through another State, whether such commerce moves wholly by rail or partly by rail and partly by motor vehicle, express, or water. This definition of "interstate commerce" for purposes of this regulation is similar to the definition of "interstate commerce" in section 203(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 303(a)).
