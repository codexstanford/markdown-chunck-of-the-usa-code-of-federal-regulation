####### Dose levels and dose selection.

(3)(i) For risk assessment purposes, at least 3 dose levels shall be used, in addition to the concurrent control group. Dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of chronic effects.

(ii) The high dose level should elicit signs of minimal toxicity without substantially altering the normal life span.

(iii) The lowest dose should not interfere with normal growth, development and longevity of the animal; and it should not otherwise cause any indication of toxicity. In general, this should not be lower than ten percent of the high dose.

(iv) The intermediate dose(s) should be established in a mid-range between the high and low doses, depending upon the toxicokinetic properties of the chemical, if known.

(v) The selection of these dose levels should be based on existing data, preferably on the results of subchronic studies.
