###### ยง 60.5475 What compliance and certification requirements must I meet and by when?
####### Recertification.

(k)(1) The manufacturer must recertify a model line whenever any change is made in the design submitted pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this section that affects or is presumed to affect the particulate matter emission rate for that model line. The manufacturer of an affected central heater must apply to the Administrator for potential recertification by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) of this section and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section or by affirming in writing that the change will not cause the central heaters in the model line to exceed applicable emission limits and requesting a waiver from certification testing. The application for recertification must be reviewed and approved by the contracted third-party certifier and a copy of the review and approval must be included. The Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer presents adequate rationale and the Administrator determines that the change may not reasonably be anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this subpart.

(2) Any change in the design tolerances of any of the following components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency if that change exceeds +/-0.64 cm (+/-1/4 inch) for any linear dimension and +/-5 percent for any cross-sectional area relating to air introduction systems and catalyst bypass gaps unless other dimensions and cross-sectional areas are previously approved by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section:

(i) Firebox: Dimensions;

(ii) Air introduction systems: Cross-sectional area of restrictive air inlets and outlets, location and method of control;

(iii) Baffles: Dimensions and locations;

(iv) Refractory/insulation: Dimensions and location;

(v) Catalyst: Dimensions and location;

(vi) Catalyst bypass mechanism and catalyst bypass gap tolerances (when bypass mechanism is in closed position): Dimensions, cross-sectional area, and location;

(vii) Flue gas exit: Dimensions and location;

(viii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets: Dimensions and fit;

(ix) Outer thermal shielding and thermal coverings: Dimensions and location;

(x) Fuel feed system: For central heaters that are designed primarily to burn wood pellet fuel or wood chips and other central heaters equipped with a fuel feed system, the fuel feed rate, auger motor design and power rating, and the angle of the auger to the firebox; and

(xi) Forced air combustion system: For central heaters so equipped, the location and horsepower of blower motors and the fan blade size.

(3) Any change in the materials used for the following components is presumed to affect particulate matter emissions and efficiency:

(i) Refractory/insulation; or

(ii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets.

(4) A change in the make, model, or composition of a catalyst is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency, unless the change has been requested by the central heater manufacturer and has been approved in advance by the Administrator, based on test data that demonstrate that the replacement catalyst is equivalent to or better than the original catalyst in terms of particulate matter emission reduction.
