(2) Where tolerances are established for residues of both-diethyl-[2-(ethylthio)ethyl] phosphorodithioate and demeton (a mixture of-diethyl-(and-) [2-(ethylthio)ethyl] phosphorothioates) on the same raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such pesticides shall not yield more residue than that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances, calculated as demeton.

(3) Where tolerances are established for both terpene polychlorinates (chlorinated mixture of camphene, pinene, and related terpenes, containing 65-66 percent chlorine) and toxaphene (chlorinated camphene containing 67-69 percent chlorine) on the same raw agricultural commodities, the total amount of such pesticides shall not yield more residue than that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances, calculated as a chlorinated terpene of molecular weight 396.6 containing 67 percent chlorine.

(4) Where a tolerance is established for more than one pesticide containing arsenic found in, or on a raw agricultural commodity, the total amount of such pesticide shall not exceed the highest established tolerance calculated as AsO

(5) Where tolerances are established for more than one member of the class of dithiocarbamates listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section on the same raw agricultural commodity, the total residue of such pesticides shall not exceed that permitted by the highest tolerance established for any one member of the class, calculated both as zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate and carbon disulfide. The tolerance based on zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate shall first be multiplied by 0.6 to convert it to the equivalent carbon disulfide tolerance, and then the carbon disulfide tolerance levels will be compared to determine the highest tolerance level per raw agricultural commodity.
