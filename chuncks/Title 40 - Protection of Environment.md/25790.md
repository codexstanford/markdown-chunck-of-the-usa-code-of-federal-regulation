### Subchapter C - Air Programs
#### PART 63 - NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORIES
##### Subpart G - National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants From the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry for Process Vents, Storage Vessels, Transfer Operations, and Wastewater
###### ยง 63.144 Process wastewater provisions - test methods and procedures for determining applicability and Group 1/Group 2 determinations (determining which wastewater streams require control).
####### Validation of EPA methods and other methods.

(A)The method used to measure organic hazardous air pollutants concentrations in the wastewater shall be validated according to section 5.1 or 5.3, and the corresponding calculations in section 6.1 or 6.3, of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section 6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. If correction is required under section 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part, the data are acceptable if the correction factor is within the range 0.7 to 1.30. Other sections of Method 301 of appendix A of this part are not required. The concentrations of the individual organic hazardous air pollutants measured in the water may be corrected to their concentrations had they been measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part, by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
