####### Significant

(x)(A)means, in reference to a net emissions increase or the potential of a source to emit any of the following pollutants, a rate of emissions that would equal or exceed any of the following rates:

(B) Notwithstanding the significant emissions rate for ozone in paragraph (a)(1)(x)(A) of this section, significant means, in reference to an emissions increase or a net emissions increase, any increase in actual emissions of volatile organic compounds that would result from any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a major stationary source locating in a serious or severe ozone nonattainment area that is subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, if such emissions increase of volatile organic compounds exceeds 25 tons per year.

(C) For the purposes of applying the requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section to modifications at major stationary sources of nitrogen oxides located in an ozone nonattainment area or in an ozone transport region, the significant emission rates and other requirements for volatile organic compounds in paragraphs (a)(1)(x)(A), (B), and (E) of this section shall apply to nitrogen oxides emissions.

(D) Notwithstanding the significant emissions rate for carbon monoxide under paragraph (a)(1)(x)(A) of this section, significant means, in reference to an emissions increase or a net emissions increase, any increase in actual emissions of carbon monoxide that would result from any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a major stationary source in a serious nonattainment area for carbon monoxide if such increase equals or exceeds 50 tons per year, provided the Administrator has determined that stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels in that area.

(E) Notwithstanding the significant emissions rates for ozone under paragraphs (a)(1)(x)(A) and (B) of this section, any increase in actual emissions of volatile organic compounds from any emissions unit at a major stationary source of volatile organic compounds located in an extreme ozone nonattainment area that is subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act shall be considered a significant net emissions increase.

(F) For the purposes of applying the requirements of paragraph (a)(13) of this section to modifications at existing major stationary sources of Ammonia located in a PMnonattainment area, if the plan requires that the control requirements of this section apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of Ammonia as a regulated NSR pollutant (as a PMprecursor), the plan shall also define "significant" for Ammonia for that area, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
