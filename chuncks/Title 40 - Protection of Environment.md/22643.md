###### Sampling Strategy.

6.4.1Challenge the CEMS with zero gas and EPA Protocol 1 cylinder gases at measurement points within the ranges specified in section 4.7.

6.4.1.1 The daily calibration gases, if Protocol 1, may be used for this test.

6.4.1.2 Operate the CEMS as nearly as possible in its normal sampling mode. The calibration gas should be injected into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical and must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling. Challenge the CEMS three non-consecutive times at each measurement point and record the responses. The duration of each gas injection should be for a sufficient period of time to ensure that the CEMS surfaces are conditioned.
