####### impingement technology performance optimization study

(i) If the applicant chooses to comply with 40 CFR 125.94(c)(5), subject to the flexibility for timing provided in 40 CFR 125.95(a)(2), themust include two years of biological data collection measuring the reduction in impingement mortality achieved by the modified traveling screens as defined at 40 CFR 125.92(s) and demonstrating that the operation has been optimized to minimize impingement mortality. A complete description of the modified traveling screens and associated equipment must be included, including, for example, type of mesh, mesh slot size, pressure sprays and fish return mechanisms. A description of any biological data collection and data collection approach used in measuring impingement mortality must be included:

(A) Collecting data no less frequently than monthly. The Director may establish more frequent data collection;

(B) Biological data collection representative of the impingement and the impingement mortality at the intakes subject to this provision;

(C) A taxonomic identification to the lowest taxon possible of all organisms collected;

(D) The method in which naturally moribund organisms are identified and taken into account;

(E) The method in which mortality due to holding times is taken into account;

(F) If the facility entraps fish or shellfish, a count of entrapment, as defined at 40 CFR 125.92(j), as impingement mortality; and

(G) The percent impingement mortality reflecting optimized operation of the modified traveling screen and all supporting calculations.
