(i)Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(3)(i), (b) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) engineering control measures (enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. Butyl rubber gloves with a minimum thickness of 16.6 mils or Silver shield gloves with a minimum thickness of 2.7 mils have been tested in accordance with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) F739 method and found by EPA to satisfy the consent orders and § 721.63(a)(2)(i) requirements for dermal protection to 100 percent chemical substance. Silver Shield gloves with a minimum thickness of 2.7 mils have been tested in accordance with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) F739 method and found by EPA to satisfy the consent orders and § 721.63(a)(2)(i) requirements for dermal protection for paint formulations where concentrations of the chemical substance is 10% or less. Gloves and other dermal protection may not be used for a time period longer than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of each work shift.
