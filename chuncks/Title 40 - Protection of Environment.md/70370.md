###### Hazardous wastestream quantity.

2.4.2.1.2Evaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any additional CERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as amended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RCRA hazardous waste that exhibits the characteristics identified under section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, include the mass of that entire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.

Based on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as follows:

- For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2-5.

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value using the Tier B equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).

- For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway-subsurface intrusion component, assign the area of observed exposure a value using the Tier B equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).

Do not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies:

- The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) is adequately determined-that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence.

If the source is the unallocated source or if this condition applies, assign the volume and area measures a value of 0 for the source (or area of observed contamination) and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5. Otherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous wastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3.
