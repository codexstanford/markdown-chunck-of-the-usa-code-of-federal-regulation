####### ยง 63.1350 Monitoring requirements.
######## i.e.,

(D) In the event that the "above span" calibration is not successful (the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the `above span' calibration for reporting based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Equation 23:

(2) Install, operate, and maintain a CMS to monitor wet scrubber or tray tower parameters, as specified in paragraphs (m)(5) and (7) of this section, and dry scrubber, as specified in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.

(3) If the source is equipped with a wet or dry scrubber or tray tower, and you choose to monitor SOemissions, monitor SOemissions continuously according to the requirements of ยง 60.63(e) and (f) of this chapter. If SOlevels increase above the 30-day rolling average SOoperating limit established during your performance test by 10 percent or more, you must:

(i) As soon as possible but no later than 30 days after you exceed the established SOvalue conduct an inspection and take corrective action to return the SOemissions to within the operating limit; and

(ii) Within 90 days of the exceedance or at the time of the next compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct an HCl emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the HCl emissions limit and to verify or re-establish the SOCEMS operating limit.

(4) If you monitor continuous performance through the use of an HCl CPMS according to paragraphs (b)(6)(v)(A) through (H) of ยง 63.1349, for any exceedance of the 30 kiln operating day HCl CPMS average value from the established operating limit, you must:

(i) Within 48 hours of the exceedance, visually inspect the APCD;

(ii) If inspection of the APCD identifies the cause of the exceedance, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the HCl CPMS measurement to within the established value; and

(iii) Within 30 days of the exceedance or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct an HCl emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the HCl emissions limit and to verify or reestablish the HCl CPMS operating limit within 45 days. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any exceedances that occur between the time of the original exceedance and the HCl emissions compliance test required under this paragraph.

(iv) HCl CPMS exceedances leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a presumptive violation of this subpart.
