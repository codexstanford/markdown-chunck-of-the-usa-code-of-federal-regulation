###### Five-hole prism-shaped probe.

6.1.1This type of probe consists of five pressure taps in the flat facets of a prism-shaped sensing head. The pressure taps are numbered 1 through 5, with the pressures measured at each hole referred to as P, P, P, P, and P, respectively. Figure 2F-3 is an illustration of the placement of pressure taps on a commonly available five-hole prism-shaped probe, the 2.5-cm (1-in.) DAT probe. (Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.) The numbering arrangement for the prism-shaped sensing head presented in Figure 2F-3 shall be followed for correct operation of the probe. A brief description of the probe measurements involved is as follows: the differential pressure P-Pis used to yaw null the probe and determine the yaw angle; the differential pressure P-Pis a function of pitch angle; and the differential pressure P-Pis a function of total velocity.
