####### Step 2.

(2)(i) Large water systems shall conduct the corrosion control studies for re-optimization under paragraph (d)(3) of this section (Step 3) unless the system is at or below the lead action level and the State has approved the modification of the existing corrosion control treatment made under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section (Step 1).

(ii) Within 12 months after the end of the tap sampling period during which a small or medium-size water system with corrosion control treatment exceeds the lead trigger level or copper action level, the State may require the water system to perform corrosion control studies for re-optimization (ยง 141.82(c)(2) or (3)). If the State does not require the system to perform such studies, the State must specify re-optimized corrosion control treatment (ยง 141.82(d)(2)) within the timeframes specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. The State must provide its determination to the system in writing.

(A) For medium-size water systems, within 12 months after the end of the tap sampling period during which such water system exceeds the lead trigger level or copper action level.

(B) For small water systems, within 18 months after the end of the tap sampling period during which such water system exceeds the lead trigger level or copper action level.
