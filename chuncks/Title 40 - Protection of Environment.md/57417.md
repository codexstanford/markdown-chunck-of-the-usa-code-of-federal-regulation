##### Subpart G - Criteria and Standards Applicable to Class I Hazardous Waste Injection Wells
###### ยง 146.68 Testing and monitoring requirements.
####### Periodic mechanical integrity testing.

(d)In fulfilling the requirements of ยง 146.8, the owner or operator of a Class I hazardous waste injection well shall conduct the mechanical integrity testing as follows:

(1) The long string casing, injection tube, and annular seal shall be tested by means of an approved pressure test with a liquid or gas annually and whenever there has been a well workover;

(2) The bottom-hole cement shall be tested by means of an approved radioactive tracer survey annually;

(3) An approved temperature, noise, or other approved log shall be run at least once every five years to test for movement of fluid along the borehole. The Director may require such tests whenever the well is worked over;

(4) Casing inspection logs shall be run whenever the owner or operator conducts a workover in which the injection string is pulled, unless the Director waives this requirement due to well construction or other factors which limit the test's reliability, or based upon the satisfactory results of a casing inspection log run within the previous five years. The Director may require that a casing inspection log be run every five years, if he has reason to believe that the integrity of the long string casing of the well may be adversely affected by naturally-occurring or man-made events;

(5) Any other test approved by the Director in accordance with the procedures in ยง 146.8(d) may also be used.
