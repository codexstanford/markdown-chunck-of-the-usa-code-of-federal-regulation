####### California, EPA Region 9.

(10)(i) All waters assigned any aquatic life or human health use classifications in the Water Quality Control Plans for the various Basins of the State ("Basin Plans"), as amended, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB"), except for ocean waters covered by the Water Quality Control Plan for Ocean Waters of California ("Ocean Plan") adopted by the SWRCB with resolution Number 90-27 on March 22, 1990, are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section, without exception. These criteria amend the portions of the existing State standards contained in the Basin Plans. More particularly these criteria amend water quality criteria contained in the Basin Plan Chapters specifying water quality objectives (the State equivalent of federal water quality criteria) for the toxic pollutants identified in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section. Although the State has adopted several use designations for each of these waters, for purposes of this action, the specific standards to be applied in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section are based on the presence in all waters of some aquatic life designation and the presence or absence of the MUN use designation (Municipal and domestic supply). (See Basin Plans for more detailed use definitions.)

(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the water and use classifications defined in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section and identified below:

(iii) The human health criteria shall be applied at the State-adopted 10risk level.
