####### Bath component

means the trade or brand name of each component(s) in trivalent chromium plating baths. For trivalent chromium baths, the bath composition is proprietary in most cases. Therefore, the trade or brand name for each component(s) can be used; however, the chemical name of the wetting agent contained in that component must be identified.
