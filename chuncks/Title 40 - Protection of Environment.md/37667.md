######## Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).

(1)You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining HAP content by Method 311.

(i) Include in the HAP total each HAP in Table 8 of this subpart that is measured at 0.1 percent by weight or more and any other HAP that is measured at 1.0 percent by weight or more. Express the weight fraction of each HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).

(ii) Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).
