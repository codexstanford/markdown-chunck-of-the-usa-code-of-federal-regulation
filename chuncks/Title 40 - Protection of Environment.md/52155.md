####### Destruction device changes that affect the destruction efficiency.

(ii)If you make a change to the destruction device that would be expected to affect the destruction efficiency, you must conduct an emissions test to update the destruction efficiency. Conduct the test before the February 28 of the year that immediately follows the change. In the calculations under ยง 98.123, apply the updated destruction efficiency to the destruction that occurs after the change to the device.
