###### "Primary aluminum ore reduction."

(8)We interpret this category to include those facilities covered by 40 CFR 60.190, the new source performance standard (NSPS) for primary aluminum ore reduction plants. This definition is also consistent with the definition at 40 CFR 63.840.

1. Emissions units listed under Step 1 are BART-eligible only if they were "in existence" on August 7, 1977 but were not "in operation" before August 7, 1962.

2. The regional haze rule defines "in existence" to mean that:

"the owner or operator has obtained all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits required by Federal, State, or local air pollution emissions and air quality laws or regulations and either has (1) begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of physical on-site construction of the facility or (2) entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of construction of the facility to be completed in a reasonable time." 40 CFR 51.301.
