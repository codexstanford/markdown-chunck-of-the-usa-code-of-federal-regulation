On September 23, 1994 Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Department of Environmental Protection) submitted a plan for the establishment and implementation of a Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, as required by section 182(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act. EPA approved the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program on September 11, 1995 and made it part of Pennsylvania SIP. As with all components of the SIP, Pennsylvania must implement the program as submitted and approved by EPA.
