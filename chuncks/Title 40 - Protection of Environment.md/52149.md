####### EPA Method 21 monitoring.

(2)If you determine that EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 is appropriate for monitoring a fluorinated GHG, conduct the screening value concentration measurements using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to determine the screening range data or the actual screening value data for the Screening Ranges Approach, EPA Correlation Approach, or the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. For the one-time testing to develop the Unit-Specific Correlation equations in EPA-453/R-95-017 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 98.7), conduct the screening value concentration measurements using EPA Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 and the bagging procedures to measure mass emissions. Concentration measurements of bagged samples must be conducted using gas chromatography following EPA Method 18 analytical procedures or other method according to ยง 98.124(e). Use methane or other appropriate compound as the calibration gas.
