####### Component description, CFV-EFC-CVS.

(d)The CVS sample system is identical to the system described in paragraph (c) of this section, plus includes a means of electronically measuring the CVS flow rate, and electronic mass flow controllers for the methanol and formaldehyde sample lines. The EFC sample system shall conform to all of the requirements listed in paragraph (c), except that the methanol and formaldehyde samples must both be drawn from a static probe. It also must comply with the following additional requirements:

(1) The ratio of the CVS mass flow rate to the sample mass flow rate shall not deviate from the design ratio by more than +/-5 percent. (The volumetric sample flow rate shall be varied inversely with the square root of the bulk stream temperature.)

(2) Flow meters to totalize sample volumes for methanol and/or formaldehyde samples shall meet the accuracy specifications of ยง 86.120. Total sample volumes may be obtained from the flow controllers, provided that the controllers meet the accuracy specifications of ยง 86.120.
