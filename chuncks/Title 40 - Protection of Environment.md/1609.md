###### ยง 33.503 How does a recipient calculate MBE and WBE participation for reporting purposes?
####### MBE or WBE Truckers/Haulers.

(f)A recipient may count expenditures to an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler only if the MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is performing a commercially useful function. The following factors should be used in determining whether an MBE or WBE trucker/hauler is performing a commercially useful function:

(1) The MBE or WBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking/hauling operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting MBE or WBE objectives.

(2) The MBE or WBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and operational truck used on the contract.
