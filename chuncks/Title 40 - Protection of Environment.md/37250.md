######## Establishing operating limits.

(e)You must establish operating limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance demonstration and periodic performance tests, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(1) The operating limits may be based on the results of the performance test and supplementary information such as engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes. You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used to develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this paragraph (e)(1) have not been approved by the Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.

(2) If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you must maintain records as specified in ยง 63.8080(g) of each point at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15 minutes.
