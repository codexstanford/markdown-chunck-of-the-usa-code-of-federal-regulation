######## Flux injection rate

(o). The owner or operator must use these procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate and, for uncontrolled furnaces, the total reactive fluorine flux injection rate.

(1) Continuously measure and record the weight of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected for each 15 minute period during the HCl, HF and D/F tests, determine and record the 15-minute block average weights, and calculate and record the total weight of the gaseous or liquid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;

(2) Record the identity, composition, and total weight of each addition of solid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;

(3) Determine the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate and, for uncontrolled furnaces, the total reactive fluorine flux injection rate by adding the recorded measurement of the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected and the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the solid reactive flux using Equation 5:

(4) Divide the weight of total chlorine or fluorine usage (W) for the 3 test runs by the recorded measurement of the total weight of feed for the 3 test runs; and

(5) If a solid reactive flux other than magnesium chloride or potassium fluoride is used, the owner or operator must derive the appropriate proportion factor subject to approval by the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources.
