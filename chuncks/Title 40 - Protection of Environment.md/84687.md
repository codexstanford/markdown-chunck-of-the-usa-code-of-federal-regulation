####### Release to water.

(i)Requirements as specified in § 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (N = 10). However, when this chemical substance is released in combination with any of the substances in § 721.10187, § 721.10188, or § 721.10190, then the value of N shall instead be adjusted according to the following formula:

[(N1 x Release1) + (N2 x Release2) + (N3 x Release3) + (N4 x Release4)] / (Release1 + Release2 + Release3 + Release4) = Adjusted N

Where the "N" variables are the N values for each of the four substances as specified in this section and § 721.10187, § 721.10188, § 721.10190 and the "Release" variables are the number of kilograms released of the respective four substances (in units of kg/site/day) per § 721.91(a).
