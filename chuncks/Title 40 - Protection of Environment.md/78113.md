(2) Describe whether aggregate or sentinel exposures under the conditions of use were considered and the basis for their consideration;

(3) Not consider costs or other nonrisk factors;

(4) Take into account, where relevant, the likely duration, intensity, frequency, and number of exposures under the condition(s) of use of the chemical substance; and
