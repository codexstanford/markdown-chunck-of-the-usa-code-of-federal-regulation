####### § 63.1220 What are the replacement standards for hazardous waste burning cement kilns?
######## Emission and hazardous waste feed limits for new sources.

(b)You must not discharge or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere or feed hazardous waste that contain:

(1) For dioxins and furans, either:

(i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen; or

(ii) Emissions in excess of 0.40 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent oxygen provided that the combustion gas temperature at the inlet to the initial dry particulate matter control device is 400 &#xB0;F or lower based on the average of the test run average temperatures;

(2) For mercury, both:

(i) An average as-fired concentration of mercury in all hazardous waste feedstreams in excess of 1.9 parts per million by weight; and

(ii) Either:

(A) Emissions in excess of 120 µg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, or

(B) A hazardous waste feed maximum theoretical emission concentration (MTEC) in excess of 120 µg/dscm;

(3) For cadmium and lead, both:

(i) Emissions in excess of 6.2 x 10lbs combined emissions of cadmium and lead attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste; and

(ii) Emissions in excess of 180 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;

(4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, both:

(i) Emissions in excess of 1.5 x 10lbs combined emissions of arsenic, beryllium, and chromium attributable to the hazardous waste per million Btu heat input from the hazardous waste; and

(ii) Emissions in excess of 54 µgm/dscm, combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
