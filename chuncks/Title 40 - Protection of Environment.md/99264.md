####### Components covered.

(c)The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase a locomotive's emissions of any regulated pollutant. This includes components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix A, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers the components you sell even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover components whose failure would not increase a locomotive's emissions of any regulated pollutant. For remanufactured locomotives, your emission-related warranty is required to cover only those parts that you supply or those parts for which you specify allowable part manufacturers. It does not need to cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.
