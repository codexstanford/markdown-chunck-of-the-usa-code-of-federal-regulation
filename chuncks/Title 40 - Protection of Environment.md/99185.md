####### Characteristic level.

(g)The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a mean value from testing some number of engines, then calculating a "characteristic level" by applying a set of statistical factors in ICAO Appendix 6 that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding standard. Engines comply with an applicable standard if the testing results show that the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed the numerical level of that standard.
