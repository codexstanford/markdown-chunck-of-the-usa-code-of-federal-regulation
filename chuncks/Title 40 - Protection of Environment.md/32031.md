####### Operating limits.

(c)On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by §§ 63.7 and 63.1384 is completed, the owner or operator must operate all affected control equipment and processes according to the following requirements.

(1)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour of an alarm from a bag leak detection system and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when the bag leak detection system alarm is sounded for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(2)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when any 3-hour block average of the monitored electrostatic precipitator (ESP) parameter is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64 subpart D when the monitored ESP parameter is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate the ESP such that the monitored ESP parameter is not outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(3)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when any 3-hour block average temperature of a cold top electric furnace as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface, exceeds 120 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F) and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator of a cold top electric furnace must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when the temperature, as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface, exceeds 120 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F) for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate the cold top electric furnace such that the temperature does not exceed 120 &#xB0;C (250 &#xB0;F) as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface, for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month reporting period.

(4)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when any 3-hour block average value for the monitored parameter(s) for a glass-melting furnace, which uses no add-on controls and which is not a cold top electric furnace, is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64 subpart D when the monitored parameter(s) is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate a glass-melting furnace, which uses no add-on controls and which is not a cold top electric furnace, such that the monitored parameter(s) is not outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(5)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when the average glass pull rate of any 4-hour block period for glass melting furnaces equipped with continuous glass pull rate monitors, or daily glass pull rate for glass melting furnaces not so equipped, exceeds the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384, by greater than 20 percent and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when the glass pull rate exceeds, by more than 20 percent, the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate each glass-melting furnace such that the glass pull rate does not exceed, by more than 20 percent, the average glass pull rate established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(6) The owner or operator must operate each incinerator used to comply with the emission limits for rotary spin or flame attenuation lines specified in Table 2 to this subpart such that any 3-hour block average temperature in the firebox does not fall below the average established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384.

(7)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when the average pressure drop, liquid flow rate, or chemical feed rate for any 3-hour block period is outside the limits established during the performance tests as specified in § 63.1384 for each wet scrubbing control device and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when any scrubber parameter is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate each scrubber such that each monitored parameter is not outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(8)(i) The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 1 hour when the monitored process parameter level(s) is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for the process modification(s) used to comply with the emission limits for rotary spin or flame attenuation lines specified in Table 2 to this subpart, and complete corrective actions in a timely manner according to the procedures in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan.

(ii) The owner or operator must implement a QIP consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring provisions of 40 CFR part 64, subpart D when the process parameter(s) is outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(iii) The owner or operator must operate the process modifications such that the monitored process parameter(s) is not outside the limit(s) established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384 for more than 10 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period.

(9) The owner or operator must use a resin in the formulation of binder such that the free-formaldehyde and free-phenol contents of the resin used do not exceed the respective ranges contained in the specification for the resin used during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384.

(10) The owner or operator must use a binder formulation that does not vary from the specification and operating range established and used during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384. For the purposes of this standard, adding or increasing the quantity of urea and/or lignin in the binder formulation does not constitute a change in the binder formulation.

(11) The owner or operator must maintain the percentage of cullet in the materials mix for each gas-fired glass-melting furnace at or below the level established during the performance test as specified in § 63.1384(a)(4).
