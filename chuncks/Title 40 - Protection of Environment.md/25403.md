####### Minor change to monitoring

means:

(1) A modification to federally required monitoring that:

(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standard;

(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the monitoring requirements); and

(iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.

(2) Examples of minor changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:

(i) Modifications to a sampling procedure, such as use of an improved sample conditioning system to reduce maintenance requirements;

(ii) Increased monitoring frequency; and

(iii) Modification of the environmental shelter to moderate temperature fluctuation and thus protect the analytical instrumentation.

(1) A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting that:

(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standards;

(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the recordkeeping or reporting requirement); and

(iii) Is site-specific.

(2) Examples of minor changes to recordkeeping or reporting include, but are not limited to:

(i) Changes to recordkeeping necessitated by alternatives to monitoring;

(ii) Increased frequency of recordkeeping or reporting, or increased record retention periods;

(iii) Increased reliability in the form of recording monitoring data, e.g., electronic or automatic recording as opposed to manual recording of monitoring data;

(iv) Changes related to compliance extensions granted pursuant to ยง 63.6(i);

(v) Changes to recordkeeping for good cause shown for a fixed short duration, e.g., facility shutdown;

(vi) Changes to recordkeeping or reporting that is clearly redundant with equivalent recordkeeping/reporting requirements; and

(vii) Decreases in the frequency of reporting for area sources to no less than once a year for good cause shown, or for major sources to no less than twice a year as required by title V, for good cause shown.
