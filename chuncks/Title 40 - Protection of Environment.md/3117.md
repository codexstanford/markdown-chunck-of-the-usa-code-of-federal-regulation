######## Actual emissions

means the actual rate of emissions, in tons per year, of an air pollutant emitted from an air pollution source. For an existing air pollution source, the actual emissions are the actual rate of emissions for the preceding calendar year and must be calculated using the actual operating hours, production rates, in-place control equipment, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the preceding calendar year. For a new air pollution source that did not operate during the preceding calendar year, the actual emissions are the estimated actual rate of emissions for the current calendar year.
