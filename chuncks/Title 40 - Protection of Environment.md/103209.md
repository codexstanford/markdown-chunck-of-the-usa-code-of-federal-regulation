(1) To calculate,, multiply its mean concentration,, by its corresponding mean molar flow rate,. If the result is a molar flow rate, convert this quantity to a mass rate by multiplying it by its molar mass,The result is the mean mass rate of the emission,. In the case of PM emissions, where the mean PM concentration is already in units of mass per mole of exhaust, simply multiply it by the mean molar flow rate,. The result is the mass rate of PM,. Calculateusing the following equation:
