(j) Substitution weighing involves measurement of a reference weight before and after each weighing of the PM sampling medium (the filter). While substitution weighing requires more measurements, it corrects for a balance's zero-drift and it relies on balance linearity only over a small range. This is most advantageous when quantifying net PM masses that are less than 0.1% of the sample medium's mass. However, it may not be advantageous when net PM masses exceed 1% of the sample medium's mass. If you utilize substitution weighing, it must be used for both pre-test and post-test weighing. The same substitution weight must be used for both pre-test and post-test weighing. Correct the mass of the substitution weight for buoyancy if the density of the substitution weight is less than 2.0 g/cm. The following steps are an example of substitution weighing:

(1) Use electrically grounded tweezers or a grounding strap, as described in ยง 1065.190.

(2) Use a static neutralizer as described in ยง 1065.190 to minimize static electric charge on any object before it is placed on the balance pan.
