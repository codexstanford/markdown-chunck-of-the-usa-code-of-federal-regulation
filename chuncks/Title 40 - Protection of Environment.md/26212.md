###### § 63.347 Reporting requirements.
####### Contents of ongoing compliance status reports.

(3)The owner or operator of an affected source for which compliance monitoring is required in accordance with § 63.343(c) shall prepare a summary report to document the ongoing compliance status of the source. The report must contain the following information:

(i) The company name and address of the affected source;

(ii) An identification of the operating parameter that is monitored for compliance determination, as required by § 63.343(c);

(iii) The relevant emission limitation for the affected source, and the operating parameter value, or range of values, that correspond to compliance with this emission limitation as specified in the notification of compliance status required by paragraph (e) of this section;

(iv) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;

(v) A description of the type of process performed in the affected source;

(vi) The total operating time of the affected source during the reporting period;

(vii) If the affected source is a hard chromium electroplating tank and the owner or operator is limiting the maximum cumulative rectifier capacity in accordance with § 63.342(c)(2), the actual cumulative rectifier capacity expended during the reporting period, on a month-by-month basis;

(viii) A summary of operating parameter values, including the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period as indicated by those values, the total duration of excess emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to process upsets, control equipment malfunctions, other known causes, and unknown causes;

(ix) A certification by a responsible official, as defined in § 63.2, that the work practice standards in § 63.342(f) were followed in accordance with the operation and maintenance plan for the source;

(x) If the operation and maintenance plan required by § 63.342(f)(3) was not followed, an explanation of the reasons for not following the provisions, an assessment of whether any excess emission and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred, and a copy of the report(s) required by § 63.342(f)(3)(iv) documenting that the operation and maintenance plan was not followed;

(xi) A description of any changes in monitoring, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;

(xii) The number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.342(a)(1), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.

(xiii) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and

(xiv) The date of the report.

(4) When more than one monitoring device is used to comply with the continuous compliance monitoring required by § 63.343(c), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each monitoring device. However, when one monitoring device is used as a backup for the primary monitoring device, the owner or operator shall only report the results from the monitoring device used to meet the monitoring requirements of this subpart. If both devices are used to meet these requirements, then the owner or operator shall report the results from each monitoring device for the relevant compliance period.
