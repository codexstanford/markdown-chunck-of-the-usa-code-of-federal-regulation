######## Corrective measures.

(v)If, after any AWFCO, there is an exceedance of an emission standard or operating requirement, irrespective of whether the exceedance occurred while hazardous waste remained in the combustion chamber (i.e., whether the hazardous waste residence time has transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated), you must investigate the cause of the AWFCO, take appropriate corrective measures to minimize future AWFCOs, and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.
