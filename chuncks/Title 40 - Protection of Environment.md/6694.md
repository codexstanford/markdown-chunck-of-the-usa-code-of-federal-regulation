() Any change in ownership at a stationary source.

(iv) For the purpose of applying the requirements of paragraph IV.H of this Ruling to modifications at major stationary sources of nitrogen oxides located in ozone nonattainment areas or in ozone transport regions, whether or not subject with respect to ozone to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act, any significant net emissions increase of nitrogen oxides is considered significant for ozone.

(v) Any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a major stationary source of volatile organic compounds that results in any increase in emissions of volatile organic compounds from any discrete operation, emissions unit, or other pollutant emitting activity at the source shall be considered a significant net emissions increase and a major modification for ozone, if the major stationary source is located in an extreme ozone nonattainment area that is subject to subpart 2, part D, title I of the Act.

(vi) This definition shall not apply with respect to a particular regulated NSR pollutant when the major stationary source is complying with the requirements under paragraph IV.K of this ruling for a PAL for that pollutant. Instead, the definition at paragraph IV.K.2(viii) of this Ruling shall apply.

(vii) Fugitive emissions shall not be included in determining for any of the purposes of this Ruling whether a physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source is a major modification, unless the source belongs to one of the source categories listed in paragraph II.A.4(iii) of this Ruling.
