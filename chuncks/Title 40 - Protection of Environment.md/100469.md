####### Flatbed trailer

means a trailer designed to accommodate side-loading cargo onto a single, continuous load-bearing surface that runs from the rear of the trailer to at least the trailer's kingpin. This includes trailers that use curtains, straps, or other devices to restrain or protect cargo while underway. It also may include similar trailers that have one or more side walls without completely enclosing the cargo space. For purposes of this definition, disregard any ramps, moveable platforms, or other rear-mounted equipment or devices designed to assist with loading the trailer.
