####### ยง 63.5160 What performance tests must I complete?
######## Thermal oxidizer.

(i)If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

(A) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.

(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
