######## i.e.,,i.e.,

(2) To demonstrate initial compliance using either a CMS that measures HAP concentrations directly (an Hg, HCl, or HF CEMS, or a sorbent trap monitoring system) or an SOor PM CEMS, the initial performance test shall consist of 30- or, if applicable for Hg, 90-boiler operating days. If the CMS is certified prior to the compliance date (or, if applicable, the approved extended compliance date), the test shall begin with the first operating day on or after that date, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section. If the CMS is not certified prior to the compliance date, the test shall begin with the first operating day after certification testing is successfully completed. In all cases, the initial 30- or 90- operating day averaging period must be completed on or before the date that compliance must be demonstrated (180 days after the applicable compliance date).

(i) The CMS performance test must demonstrate compliance with the applicable Hg, HCl, HF, PM, or SOemissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
