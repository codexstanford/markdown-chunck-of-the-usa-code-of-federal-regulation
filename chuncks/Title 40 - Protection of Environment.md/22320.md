###### 3.5 Estimated Detection Limit (EDL).

The minimum qualitatively recognizable signal above background for a target compound. The EDL is a detection limit specific to each sample analysis based on the noise signal measured near the retention time of a target compound or target isomer group. Being sample specific, the EDL is affected by sample size, dilution, recoveries of pre-extraction standard, chemical noise from sample extract, electronic noise from instrument, extract aliquot, relative response of instrument, etc.
