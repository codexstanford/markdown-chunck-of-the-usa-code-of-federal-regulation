####### ยง 63.10042 What definitions apply to this subpart?
######## Fossil fuel-fired,e.g.,

means an electric utility steam generating unit (EGU) that is capable of producing more than 25 MW of electrical output from the combustion of fossil fuels. To be "capable of combusting" fossil fuels, an EGU would need to have these fuels allowed in its operating permit and have the appropriate fuel handling facilities on-site or otherwise available (coal handling equipment, including coal storage area, belts and conveyers, pulverizers, etc.; oil storage facilities). In addition, fossil fuel-fired means any EGU that fired fossil fuels for more than 10.0 percent of the average annual heat input during the 3 previous calendar years after the compliance date for your facility in ยง 63.9984 or for more than 15.0 percent of the annual heat input during any one of those calendar years. EGU owners and operators must estimate coal, oil, and natural gas usage for the first 3 calendar years after the applicable compliance date and they are solely responsible for assuring compliance with this final rule or other applicable standard based on their fuel usage projections. After the first 3 years of compliance, EGUs are required to evaluate applicability based on coal or oil usage from the three previous calendars years on an annual rolling basis.
