####### Plan components.

(b)The owner or operator shall organize the work practice plan to indicate clearly which parts of the plan pertain to each emission point subject to visible emission standards under this subpart. Each of the following provisions, at a minimum, shall be addressed in the plan:

(1) An initial and refresher training program for all coke plant operating personnel with responsibilities that impact emissions, including contractors, in job requirements related to emission control and the requirements of this subpart, including work practice requirements. Contractors with responsibilities that impact emission control may be trained by the owner or operator or by qualified contractor personnel; however, the owner or operator shall ensure that the contractor training program complies with the requirements of this section. The training program in the plan must include:

(i) A list, by job title, of all personnel that are required to be trained and the emission point(s) associated with each job title;

(ii) An outline of the subjects to be covered in the initial and refresher training for each group of personnel;

(iii) A description of the training method(s) that will be used (e.g., lecture, video tape);

(iv) A statement of the duration of initial training and the duration and frequency of refresher training;

(v) A description of the methods to be used at the completion of initial or refresher training to demonstrate and document successful completion of the initial and refresher training; and

(vi) A description of the procedure to be used to document performance of plan requirements pertaining to daily operation of the coke oven battery and its emission control equipment, including a copy of the form to be used, if applicable, as required under the plan provisions implementing paragraph (b)(7) of this section.

(2) Procedures for controlling emissions from coke oven doors on by-product coke oven batteries, including:

(i) A program for the inspection, adjustment, repair, and replacement of coke oven doors and jambs, and any other equipment for controlling emissions from coke oven doors, including a defined frequency of inspections, the method to be used to evaluate conformance with operating specifications for each type of equipment, and the method to be used to audit the effectiveness of the inspection and repair program for preventing exceedances;

(ii) Procedures for identifying leaks that indicate a failure of the emissions control equipment to function properly, including a clearly defined chain of command for communicating information on leaks and procedures for corrective action;

(iii) Procedures for cleaning all sealing surfaces of each door and jamb, including identification of the equipment that will be used and a specified schedule or frequency for the cleaning of sealing surfaces;

(iv) For batteries equipped with self-sealing doors, procedures for use of supplemental gasketing and luting materials, if the owner or operator elects to use such procedures as part of the program to prevent exceedances;

(v) For batteries equipped with hand-luted doors, procedures for luting and reluting, as necessary to prevent exceedances;

(vi) Procedures for maintaining an adequate inventory of the number of spare coke oven doors and jambs located onsite; and

(vii) Procedures for monitoring and controlling collecting main back pressure, including corrective action if pressure control problems occur.

(3) Procedures for controlling emissions from charging operations on by-product coke oven batteries, including:

(i) Procedures for equipment inspection, including the frequency of inspections, and replacement or repair of equipment for controlling emissions from charging, the method to be used to evaluate conformance with operating specifications for each type of equipment, and the method to be used to audit the effectiveness of the inspection and repair program for preventing exceedances;

(ii) Procedures for ensuring that the larry car hoppers are filled properly with coal;

(iii) Procedures for the alignment of the larry car over the oven to be charged;

(iv) Procedures for filling the oven (e.g., procedures for staged or sequential charging);

(v) Procedures for ensuring that the coal is leveled properly in the oven; and

(vi) Procedures and schedules for inspection and cleaning of offtake systems (including standpipes, standpipe caps, goosenecks, dampers, and mains), oven roofs, charging holes, topside port lids, the steam supply system, and liquor sprays.

(4) Procedures for controlling emissions from topside port lids on by-product coke oven batteries, including:

(i) Procedures for equipment inspection and replacement or repair of topside port lids and port lid mating and sealing surfaces, including the frequency of inspections, the method to be used to evaluate conformance with operating specifications for each type of equipment, and the method to be used to audit the effectiveness of the inspection and repair program for preventing exceedances; and

(ii) Procedures for sealing topside port lids after charging, for identifying topside port lids that leak, and procedures for resealing.

(5) Procedures for controlling emissions from offtake system(s) on by-product coke oven batteries, including:

(i) Procedures for equipment inspection and replacement or repair of offtake system components, including the frequency of inspections, the method to be used to evaluate conformance with operating specifications for each type of equipment, and the method to be used to audit the effectiveness of the inspection and repair program for preventing exceedances;

(ii) Procedures for identifying offtake system components that leak and procedures for sealing leaks that are detected; and

(iii) Procedures for dampering off ovens prior to a push.

(6) Procedures for controlling emissions from nonrecovery coke oven batteries including:

(i) Procedures for charging coal into the oven, including any special procedures for minimizing air infiltration during charging, maximizing the draft on the oven, and for replacing the door promptly after charging;

(ii) If applicable, procedures for the capture and control of charging emissions;

(iii) Procedures for cleaning coke from the door sill area for both sides of the battery after completing the pushing operation and before replacing the coke oven door;

(iv) Procedures for cleaning coal from the door sill area after charging and before replacing the push side door;

(v) Procedures for filling gaps around the door perimeter with sealant material, if applicable; and

(vi) Procedures for detecting and controlling emissions from smoldering coal.

(7) Procedures for maintaining, for each emission point subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart, a daily record of the performance of plan requirements pertaining to the daily operation of the coke oven battery and its emission control equipment, including:

(i) Procedures for recording the performance of such plan requirements; and

(ii) Procedures for certifying the accuracy of such records by the owner or operator.

(8) Any additional work practices or requirements specified by the Administrator according to paragraph (d) of this section.
