###### Option 1:

4.5.5.7The various Oconcentrations required in steps 4.5.3.11 and 4.5.5.5 may be obtained by dilution of the Oconcentration generated in steps 4.5.3.6 and 4.5.5.3. With this option, accurate flow measurements are required. The dynamic calibration system may be modified as shown in Figure 3 to allow for dilution air to be metered in downstream of the Ogenerator. A mixing chamber between the Ogenerator and the output manifold is also required. The flow rate through the Ogenerator (Fo) and the dilution air flow rate (FD) are measured with a flow or volume standard that is traceable to a NIST flow or volume calibration standard. Each Oconcentration generated by dilution is calculated from:
