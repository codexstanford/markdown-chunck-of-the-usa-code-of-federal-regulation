(B) Containers shall be composed of material that () adsorb negligible amounts of test chemical, and () withstand high speed centrifugation. The volume of the container is not a major consideration; however, it is extremely important that the amount of soil or sediment and the solid/solution ratio used in the study result in minimal container headspace. It is also extremely important that the containers be sterilized before use.

(C) A 150 micron (100 mesh) stainless-steel or brass sieve.

(D) Drying oven, with circulating air, that can attain 100 &#xB0;C.

(E) Vortex mixer or a comparable device.

(F) Rotary shaker or a comparable device.

(G) High speed temperature-controlled centrifuge capable of sedimenting particles greater than 0.5 micron from aqueous solution.
