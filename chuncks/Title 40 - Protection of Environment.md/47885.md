##### Subpart S - General Compliance Provisions for Control of Air Pollution From New and In-Use Light-Duty Vehicles, Light-Duty Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Vehicles
###### § 86.1823-01 Durability demonstration procedures for exhaust emissions.

This section applies to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, complete heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles certified under the provisions of § 86.1801-01(c). Eligible small volume manufacturers or small volume test groups may optionally meet the requirements of §§ 86.1838-01 and 86.1826-01 in lieu of the requirements of this section. For model years 2001, 2002, and 2003 all manufacturers may elect to meet the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section in lieu of these requirements for light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks.

(a) The manufacturer shall propose a durability program consisting of the elements discussed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section for advance approval by the Administrator. The durability process shall be designed to effectively predict the expected deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles over their full and intermediate useful life and shall be consistent with good engineering judgment. The Administrator will approve the program if he/she determines that it is reasonably expected to meet these design requirements.
