###### 13.1 Background Assessment-Field Train Proof Blank, LMB and Materials.,e.g.,

Determine the contribution to target compound concentration from reagents, media and glassware used to make target compound measurements. Conduct at least one field train proof blank for each test series at a single facility. Analyze at least one LMB sample during an analytical sequence or every 12 hours, whichever is shorter. Native target compound concentrations in the field train proof blank, LMB and materials assessment must be less than or equal to three times the EDL of the method or 10 times lower than the quantitation limit required by the end use of the data (compliance limit or other limits set by consent decree or permit), whichever is higher. The field train proof blank, LMB and materials assessment must also meet the performance specifications in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9, as applicable to the compound target list.
