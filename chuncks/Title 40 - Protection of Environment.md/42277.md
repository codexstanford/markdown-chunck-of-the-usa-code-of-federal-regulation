####### Submittal for other allowances for auction.

(c)Authorized account representatives may offer allowances for sale at auction, provided that allowances are dated for the year in which they are offered or for any previous year or for seven years following the year in which they are offered. Such authorized account representatives may specify a minimum price for the allowances offered at the auctions. The authorized account representative must notify the Administrator fifteen business days prior to the auctions, using the SOAllowance Offer Form published by the Administrator, or by means of electronic communication if the Administrator, following public notice, so requires or permits at some future time. The notification shall include:

(1) The compliance use date of the allowances offered;

(2) The number of allowances to be sold and any other information identifying the allowances offered that may be required by subpart C of this part;

(3) Any minimum price; and

(4) Whether the authorized account representative is willing to sell fewer allowances than the number stated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the full amount cannot be sold. After notification, the Administrator will deduct allowances from the appropriate Allowance Tracking System account from which allowances are being offered and place them in a separate subaccount for such allowances.
