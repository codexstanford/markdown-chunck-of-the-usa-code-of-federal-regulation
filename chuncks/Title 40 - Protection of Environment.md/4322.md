9.1Procedures are described for short-term sampling (30-minute and 1-hour) and for long-term sampling (24-hour). Different combinations of absorbing reagent volume, sampling rate, and sampling time can be selected to meet special needs. For combinations other than those specifically described, the conditions must be adjusted so that linearity is maintained between absorbance and concentration over the dynamic range. Absorbing reagent volumes less than 10 mL are not recommended. The collection efficiency is above 98 percent for the conditions described; however, the efficiency may be substantially lower when sampling concentrations below 25 Âµ&#x3B3;SO/m.()
