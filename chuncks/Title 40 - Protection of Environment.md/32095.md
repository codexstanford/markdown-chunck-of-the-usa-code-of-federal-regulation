####### Heat exchange system

means any cooling tower system or once-through cooling water system (e.g., river or pond water) designed and intended to operate to not allow contact between the cooling medium and process fluid or gases (i.e., a noncontact system). A heat exchange system may include more than one heat exchanger and may include recirculating or once-through cooling systems.
