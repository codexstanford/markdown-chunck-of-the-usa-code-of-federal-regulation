###### ยง 141.92 Monitoring for lead in schools and child care facilities.

All community water systems must conduct directed public education and lead monitoring at the schools and child care facilities they serve if those schools or child care facilities were constructed prior to January 1, 2014 or the date the State adopted standards that meet the definition of lead free in accordance with Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended by the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, whichever is earlier. Water systems must conduct lead sampling at elementary schools and child care facilities they serve once and on request of the facility thereafter. Water systems shall also conduct lead sampling at secondary schools they serve on request. The provisions of this section do not apply to a school or child care facility that is regulated as a public water system. The provisions in paragraph (a) of this section apply until a water system samples all the elementary schools and child care facilities they serve once as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Thereafter, water systems shall follow the provisions as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
