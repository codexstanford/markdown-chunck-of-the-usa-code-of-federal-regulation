####### ยง 49.138 Rule for the registration of air pollution sources and the reporting of emissions.
######## Report of relocation.

(5)After initial registration, the owner or operator of an air pollution source must report any relocation of the source to the Regional Administrator in writing no later than 30 days prior to the relocation of the source. The report must update the information required in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(v) and (e)(3)(viii) of this section, and any other information required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section if it will change as a result of the relocation. Submitting a report of relocation does not relieve the owner or operator from the requirement to obtain a permit to construct if the relocation of the air pollution source would be a new source or modification subject to any Federal or Tribal permit to construct rule.
