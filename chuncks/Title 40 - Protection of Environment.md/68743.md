(2)Vessels at sea or at port are not subject to this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, used oil produced on vessels from normal shipboard operations is considered to be generated at the time it is transported ashore. The owner or operator of the vessel and the person(s) removing or accepting used oil from the vessel are co-generators of the used oil and are both responsible for managing the waste in compliance with this subpart once the used oil is transported ashore. The co-genenerators may decide among them which party will fulfill the requirements of this subpart.
