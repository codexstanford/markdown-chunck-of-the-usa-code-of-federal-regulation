####### ยง 49.122 Partial delegation of administrative authority to a Tribe.
######## How is the partial delegation of administrative authority accomplished?

(c)(1) A Partial Delegation of Administrative Authority Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, will specify the provisions that the Tribe will be authorized to administer on behalf of EPA, and will be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the Tribe. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Regional Administrator and the Tribe have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the Tribe will have the authority under the Clean Air Act, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for administering one or more of the Federal requirements that are in effect in subpart M of this part for the particular Indian reservation and will act on behalf of the Regional Administrator.

(2) A Partial Delegation of Administrative Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with the Tribe. Any substantive modifications or amendments will be subject to the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.
