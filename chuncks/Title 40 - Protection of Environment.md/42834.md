######### Unit with multiple stack or duct configuration.

(d)When the flue gases from an affected unit discharge to the atmosphere through more than one stack, or when the flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than in the stack, the owner or operator shall either:

(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each of the multiple stacks and determine NOmass emissions from the affected unit as the sum of the NOmass emissions recorded for each stack. If another unit also exhausts flue gases into one of the monitored stacks, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in order to properly determine the NOmass emissions from the units using that stack;

(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each of the ducts that feed into the stack, and determine NOmass emissions from the affected unit using the sum of the NOmass emissions measured at each duct; or

(3) If the unit is eligible to use the procedures in appendix D to this part and if the conditions and restrictions of ยง 75.17(c)(2) are fully met, install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system in one of the ducts feeding into the stack or in one of the multiple stacks, (as applicable) in accordance with ยง 75.17(c)(2), and use the procedures in appendix D to this part to determine heat input rate for the unit.
