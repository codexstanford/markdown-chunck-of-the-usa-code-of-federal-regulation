######## Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation not using liquid-liquid material balances.

(j)For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the controlled coating operation, excluding all periods of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, during the month using Equation 2 of this section. The calculation of mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the controlled coating operation during the month applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings and thinners that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during each month. Except as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement of the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. Equation 2 of this section treats the materials used during such a deviation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation.

(1) Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the coatings used in the controlled coating operation, kg, using Equation 2A of this section.

(2) Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the thinners used in the controlled coating operation, kg, using Equation 2B of this section.

(3) Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the coatings used in the controlled coating operation during deviations specified in ยง 63.3163(c) and (d), using Equation 2C of this section:

(4) Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the thinners used in the controlled coating operation during deviations specified in ยง 63.3163(c) and (d), using Equation 2D of this section:
