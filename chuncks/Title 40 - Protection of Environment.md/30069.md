######## Hydrocarbon readings exceeding the span.

(4)(i) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, if a hydrocarbon CEMS detects a response that results in a one-minute average at or above the 100 ppmv span level required by Performance Specification 8A in appendix B, part 60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be recorded as 500 ppmv. The one-minute 500 ppmv value must be used for calculating the hourly rolling average HC level.

(ii) Hydrocarbon CEMS that use a span value of 500 ppmv when one-minute hydrocarbon levels are equal to or exceed 100 ppmv are not subject to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Hydrocarbon CEMS that use a span value of 500 ppmv are subject to the same CEMS performance and equipment specifications when operating in the range of 100 ppmv to 500 ppmv that are provided by Performance Specification 8A for other hydrocarbon CEMS, except:

(A) The zero and high-level calibration gas must have a hydrocarbon level of between 0 and 100 ppmv, and between 250 and 450 ppmv, respectively;

(B) The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be capable of recording all readings within the CEM measurement range and must have a resolution of 2.5 ppmv;

(C) The CEMS calibration must not differ by more than +/-15 ppmv after each 24-hour period of the seven day test at both zero and high levels;

(D) The calibration error must be no greater than 25 ppmv; and

(E) The zero level, mid-level, and high level calibration gas used to determine calibration error must have a hydrocarbon level of 0-200 ppmv, 150-200 ppmv, and 350-400 ppmv, respectively.
