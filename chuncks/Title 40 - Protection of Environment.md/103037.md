###### ยง 1065.518 Engine preconditioning.
####### Ramped-modal cycle for steady-state testing.

(5)Precondition the engine by running at least the second half of the ramped-modal cycle, based on the number of test modes. For example, for the five-mode cycle specified in 40 CFR 1039.505(b)(1), the second half of the cycle consists of modes three through five. We will precondition your engine by running one complete ramped-modal cycle. Do not shut down the engine between cycles. Immediately after completing each preconditioning cycle, start the next cycle (including the emission test) as soon as practical. For any repeat cycles, start the next cycle within 60 seconds after completing the last preconditioning cycle. See ยง 1065.530(a)(1)(iii) for additional instructions if the cycle begins and ends under different operating conditions.

(d) You may conduct calibrations or verifications on any idle equipment or analyzers during engine preconditioning.
