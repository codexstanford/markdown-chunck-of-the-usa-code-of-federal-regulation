####### Halogenated vent determination.

(g)In order to determine whether a process vent is halogenated, the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in organic compounds shall be calculated according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. A process vent is considered halogenated if the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in the organic compounds is equal to or greater than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour).

(1) The process vent concentration of each organic compound containing halogen atoms (parts per million by volume, by compound) shall be determined based on one of the following procedures:

(i) Process knowledge that no halogen or hydrogen halides are present in the process vent; or

(ii) Applicable engineering assessment as discussed in paragraph (i)(3) of this section; or

(iii) Concentration of organic compounds containing halogens measured by Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; or

(iv) Any other method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63.

(2) Equation 64-4 of this section shall be used to calculate the mass emission rate of halogen atoms:
