####### Producing establishment's registration number.

(f)The producing establishment registration number preceded by the phrase "EPA Est.", of the final establishment at which the product was produced may appear in any suitable location on the label or immediate container. It must appear on the wrapper or outside container of the package if the EPA establishment registration number on the immediate container cannot be clearly read through such wrapper or container. For a pesticide product packaged in a refillable container, an appropriately sized area on the label may be left blank after the phrase "EPA Est." to allow the EPA establishment registration number to be marked in by the refiller according to 40 CFR 165.65(h) or 165.70(i) prior to distribution or sale of the pesticide.
