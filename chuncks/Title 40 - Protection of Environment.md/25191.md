###### § 63.7 Performance testing requirements.
####### Request to waive a performance test.

(3)(i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i), the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested or if the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.

(ii) If an application for a waiver of a subsequent performance test is made, the application may accompany any required compliance progress report, compliance status report, or excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report [such as those required under § 63.6(i), § 63.9(h), and § 63.10(e) or specified in a relevant standard or in the source's title V permit], but it shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.

(iii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source performing the required test.
