####### Reconfiguration.

(1)Each time equipment is reconfigured for production of a different product or intermediate, the batch product-process equipment train shall be pressure-tested for leaks before regulated material is first fed to the equipment and the equipment is placed in regulated material service.

(i) When the batch product-process equipment train is reconfigured to produce a different product, pressure testing is required only for the new or disturbed equipment.

(ii) Each batch product process that operates in regulated material service during a calendar year shall be pressure-tested at least once during that calendar year.

(iii) Pressure testing is not required for routine seal breaks, such as changing hoses or filters, that are not part of the reconfiguration to produce a different product or intermediate.
