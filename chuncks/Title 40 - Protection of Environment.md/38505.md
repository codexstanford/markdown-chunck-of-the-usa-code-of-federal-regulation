16.1 Application of EPA test Methods 1 and 2. If you use periodic stack testing to comply with anemissions limit, you must determine the stack gas flow rate during each performance test run in which EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26, 26A, 29, or 30B is used, in order to convert the measured pollutant concentration to units of the standard. For EPA test Methods 5, 5D, 26A and 29, which require isokinetic sampling, the delta-P readings made with the pitot tube and manometer at the EPA test Method 1 traverse points, taken together with measurements of stack gas temperature, pressure, diluent gas concentration (from a separate EPA test Method 3A or 3B test) and moisture, provide the necessary data for the EPA test Method 2 flow rate calculations. Note that even if you elect to comply with astandard, when EPA test Method 5, 5D, 26A, or 29 is used, you must still use EPA test Method 2 to determine the average stack gas velocity (v), which is needed for the percent isokinetic calculation. The EPA test Methods 26 and 30B do not require isokinetic sampling; therefore, when either of these methods is used, if the stack gas flow rate is needed to comply with the applicableemissions limit, you must make a separate EPA test Method 2 determination during each test run.
