(b) The Pb NAAQS is violated at a monitoring site when the identified design value is valid and is greater than 0.15 µg/m, no matter whether determined from Pb-TSP or Pb-PMdata. A Pb design value greater than 0.15 µg/mis valid no matter how many valid 3-month means in the 3-year period it encompasses; that is, a violating design value is valid even if it (, the highest 3-month mean) is the only valid 3-month mean in the 3-year timeframe. Further, a site does not have to monitor for three full calendar years in order to have a valid violating design value; a site could monitor just three months and still produce a valid (violating) design value.
