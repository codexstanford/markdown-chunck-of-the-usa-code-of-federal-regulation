8.5.4.5You must weigh or measure the volume of the contents of CPM Container #4 either in the field or during sample analysis (Section 11.2.4). If the water from the cold impinger has been weighed in the field, it can be discarded. Otherwise, quantitatively transfer liquid from the cold impinger that follows the CPM filter into a clean, leak-proof container labeled with test identification and "CPM Container #4, Cold Water Impinger." Mark the liquid level on the container. CPM Container #4 holds the remainder of the liquid water from the emission gases.
