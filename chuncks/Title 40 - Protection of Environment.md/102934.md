####### Temperature.,T,T

(8)You may perform the linearity verification for temperature measurement systems with thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors by removing the sensor from the system and using a simulator in its place. Use a NIST-traceable simulator that is independently calibrated and, as appropriate, cold-junction-compensated. The simulator uncertainty scaled to absolute temperature must be less than 0.5% of. If you use this option, you must use sensors that the supplier states are accurate to better than 0.5% ofcompared with their standard calibration curve.
