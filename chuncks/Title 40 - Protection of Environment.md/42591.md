####### Procedures for loss of certification.

(5)When the Administrator issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application or a notice of disapproval of certification status (as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), then:

(i) Until such time, date, and hour as the continuous emission monitoring system can be adjusted, repaired, or replaced and certification tests successfully completed (or, if the conditional data validation procedures in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section are used, until a probationary calibration error test is passed following corrective actions in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), the owner or operator shall substitute the following values, as applicable, for each hour of unit operation during the period of invalid data specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section or in § 75.21: the maximum potential concentration of SO, as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part, to report SOconcentration; the maximum potential NOemission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, to report NOemissions in lb/mmBtu; the maximum potential concentration of NO, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, to report NOemissions in ppm (when a NOconcentration monitoring system is used to determine NOmass emissions, as defined under § 75.71(a)(2)); the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, to report volumetric flow; the maximum potential concentration of CO, as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part, to report COconcentration data; and either the minimum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part or, if Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NOemission rate, the maximum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part; and

(ii) The designated representative shall submit a notification of certification retest dates as specified in § 75.61(a)(1)(ii) and a new certification application according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

(iii) The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or other requirements that were failed by the continuous emission or opacity monitoring system, as indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of disapproval.
