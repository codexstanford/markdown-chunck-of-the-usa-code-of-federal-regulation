######## Upholstery leather (less than 4 grams finish add-on per square foot)

means an upholstery leather with a final finish add-on to leather ratio of less than 4 grams of finish per square foot of leather. These types of finishes are typically used for furniture seating covers. The finishes tend to be solvent-based and leave a thinner, softer, and more natural leather texture.
