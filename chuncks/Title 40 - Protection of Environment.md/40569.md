###### ยง 65.6 Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and procedures.
####### Operation of source.

(2)During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of a regulated source shall operate and maintain such source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in accordance with ยง 65.3(a). The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
