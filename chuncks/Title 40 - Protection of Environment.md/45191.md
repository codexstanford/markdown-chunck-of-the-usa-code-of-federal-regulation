###### Appendix B2 to Subpart F of Part 82 - Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling, and/or Reclaim Equipment
####### Recycle Flow Rate.

9.3The recycle flow rate shall be as defined in 3.10, expressed in kg/min, and the accuracy shall be per 9.4.

9.3.1 For equipment using multi-pass recycling or a separate sequence, the recycle rate shall be determined by dividing the net weight W of the refrigerant to be recycled by the actual time T required to recycle. Any set-up or operator interruptions shall not be included in the time T.

9.3.2 If no separate recycling sequence is used, the recycle rate shall be the higher of the vapor refrigerant recovery rate or the liquid refrigerant recovery rate. The recycle rate shall match a process which leads to contaminant levels in 9.9. Specifically, a recovery rate determined from bypassing a contaminant removal device cannot be used as a recycle rate when the contaminant levels in 9.9 are determined by passing the refrigerant through the contaminant removal device.
