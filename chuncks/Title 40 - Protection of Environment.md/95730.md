####### Range-finding test.

(3)(i) A range-finding test should be conducted to establish test solution concentrations for the definitive test.

(ii) The daphnids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced concentrations of the test chemical (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/1, etc.), usually under static conditions.

(iii) A minimum of five daphnids should be exposed to each concentration of test chemical for a period of 48 hours. The exposure period may be shortened if data suitable for the purpose of the range-finding test can be obtained in less time. No replicates are required and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
