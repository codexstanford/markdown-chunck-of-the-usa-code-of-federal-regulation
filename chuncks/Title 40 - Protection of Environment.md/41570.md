####### Exemption for certain territories.

(m)Upon petition by the Governor of Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the Administrator may exempt any source or class of sources in such territory from the requirement to have a part 71 permit under this chapter. Such an exemption does not exempt such source or class of sources from any requirement of section 112 of the Act, including the requirements of section 112 (g) or (j).

(1) Such exemption may be granted if the Administrator finds that compliance with part 71 is not feasible or is unreasonable due to unique geographical, meteorological, or economic factors of such territory, or such other local factors as the Administrator deems significant. Any such petition shall be considered in accordance with section 307(d) of the Act, and any exemption granted under this paragraph (m) shall be considered final action by the Administrator for the purposes of section 307(b) of the Act.

(2) The Administrator shall promptly notify the Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Environment and Public Works and on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate upon receipt of any petition under this paragraph (m) and of the approval or rejection of such petition and the basis for such action.
