(vi) For sources performing hard chromium electroplating, the maximum potential cumulative potential rectifier capacity;

(vii) For sources performing hard chromium electroplating, a statement of whether the affected source(s) is located at a small or a large, hard chromium electroplating facility and whether this will be demonstrated through actual or maximum potential cumulative rectifier capacity;

(viii) For sources performing hard chromium electroplating, a statement of whether the owner or operator of an affected source(s) will limit the maximum potential cumulative rectifier capacity in accordance with ยง 63.342(c)(2) such that the hard chromium electroplating facility is considered small; and
