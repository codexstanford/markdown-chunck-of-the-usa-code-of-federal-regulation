####### Temporary enclosure

(16)means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an affected facility. A temporary enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive VOC emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in ยง 60.713(b)(5)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
