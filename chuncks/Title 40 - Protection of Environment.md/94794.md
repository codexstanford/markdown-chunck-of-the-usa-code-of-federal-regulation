####### qualitative analysis

Forby XRD methods, samples are initially scanned over limited diagnostic peak regions for the serpentine (âˆ¼7.4 &#xC5;) and amphibole (8.2-8.5 &#xC5;) minerals (Table 2-2). Standard slow-scanning methods for bulk sample analysis may be used for materials shown by PLM to contain significant amounts of asbestos (>5-10 percent). Detection of minor or trace amounts of asbestos may require special sample preparation and step-scanning analysis. All samples that exhibit diffraction peaks in the diagnostic regions for asbestiform minerals are submitted to a full (5&#xB0;-60&#xB0; 2&#x3B8;; 1&#xB0; 2&#x3B8;/min) qualitative XRD scan, and their diffraction patterns are compared with standard reference powder diffraction patternsto verify initial peak assignments and to identify possible matrix interferences when subsequent quantitative analysis will be performed.
