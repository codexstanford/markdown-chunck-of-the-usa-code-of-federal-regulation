####### Nuclear specialty coating

means any protective coating used to seal porous surfaces such as steel (or concrete) that otherwise would be subject to intrusion by radioactive materials. These coatings must be resistant to long-term (service life) cumulative radiation exposure (ASTM D4082-89 [incorporation by reference-see ยง 63.14]), relatively easy to decontaminate (ASTM D4256-89 or 94 [reapproved 1994] [incorporation by reference-see ยง 63.14]), and resistant to various chemicals to which the coatings are likely to be exposed (ASTM D3912-80 [incorporation by reference-see ยง 63.14]). [For nuclear coatings, see the general protective requirements outlined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a report entitled "U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Regulatory Guide 1.54" dated June 1973, available through the Government Printing Office at (202) 512-2249 as document number A74062-00001.]
