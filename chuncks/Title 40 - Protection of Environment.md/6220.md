means an optional set of analyses provided by a state that are designed to show that emissions of a particular PMprecursor do not contribute significantly to PMlevels that exceed the relevant PMstandard in a particular nonattainment area. The three types of precursor demonstrations provided in this rule are the comprehensive precursor demonstration, the major stationary source precursor demonstration, and the NNSR precursor demonstration.
