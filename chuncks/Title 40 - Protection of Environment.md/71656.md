###### Conditional POTW program approval.

(c)The POTW may request conditional approval of the Pretreatment Program pending the acquisition of funding and personnel for certain elements of the Program. The request for conditional approval must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section except that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, may be relaxed if the Submission demonstrates that:

(1) A limited aspect of the Program does not need to be implemented immediately;

(2) The POTW had adequate legal authority and procedures to carry out those aspects of the Program which will not be implemented immediately; and

(3) Funding and personnel for the Program aspects to be implemented at a later date will be available when needed. The POTW will describe in the Submission the mechanism by which this funding will be acquired. Upon receipt of a request for conditional approval, the Approval Authority will establish a fixed date for the acquisition of the needed funding and personnel. If funding is not acquired by this date, the conditional approval of the POTW Pretreatment Program and any removal allowances granted to the POTW, may be modified or withdrawn.
