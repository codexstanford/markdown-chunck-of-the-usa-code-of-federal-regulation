###### § 1066.20 Units of measure and overview of calculations.
####### Units conversion.

(b)Use good engineering judgment to convert units between measurement systems as needed. For example, if you measure vehicle speed as kilometers per hour and we specify a precision requirement in terms of miles per hour, convert your measured kilometer per hour value to miles per hour before comparing it to our specification. The following conventions are used throughout this document and should be used to convert units as applicable:

(1) 1 hp = 33,000 ft &#xB7; lbf/min = 550 ft &#xB7; lbf/s = 0.7457 kW.

(2) 1 lbf = 32.174 ft &#xB7; lbm/s= 4.4482 N.

(3) 1 inch = 25.4 mm.

(4) 1 mile = 1609.344 m.

(5) For ideal gases, 1 µmol/mol = 1 ppm.

(6) For ideal gases, 10 mmol/mol = 1%.
