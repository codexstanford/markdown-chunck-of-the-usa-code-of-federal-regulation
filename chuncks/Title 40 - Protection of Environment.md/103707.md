(1) In this paragraph (c), the letter "y" denotes a generic measured quantity, the superscript over-bar denotes an arithmetic mean (such as), and the subscript "" denotes the known or reference quantity being measured.

(2) Operate the dynamometer system at the specified operating conditions. This may include any specified adjustment or periodic calibration of the dynamometer system.

(3) Set dynamometer speed and torque to zero.

(4) Verify the dynamometer speed or torque signal based on the dynamometer manufacturer's recommendations.

(5) After verification, check for zero speed and torque. Use good engineering judgment to determine whether or not to rezero or re-verify speed and torque before continuing.
