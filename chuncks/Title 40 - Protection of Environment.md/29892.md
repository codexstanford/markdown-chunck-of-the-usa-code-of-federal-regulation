####### § 63.1206 When and how must you comply with the standards and operating requirements?
######## Alternative standards for existing or new hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns using MACT.

(9)(i) You may petition the Administrator to request alternative standards to the mercury or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emission standards of this subpart, to the semivolatile metals emission standards under §§ 63.1205, 63.1221(a)(3)(ii), or 63.1221(b)(3)(ii), or to the low volatile metals emissions standards under §§ 63.1205, 63.1221(a)(4)(ii), or 63.1221(b)(4)(ii) if:

(A) You cannot achieve one or more of these standards while using maximum achievable control technology (MACT) because of raw material contributions to emissions of mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas; or

(B) You determine that mercury is not present at detectable levels in your raw material.

(ii) The alternative standard that you recommend under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section may be an operating requirement, such as a hazardous waste feedrate limitation for metals and/or chlorine, and/or an emission limitation.

(iii) The alternative standard must include a requirement to use MACT, or better, applicable to the standard for which the source is seeking relief, as defined in paragraphs (b)(9)(viii) and (ix) of this section.
