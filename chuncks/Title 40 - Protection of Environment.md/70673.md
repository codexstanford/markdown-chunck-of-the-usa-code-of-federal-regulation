###### Calculation of sensitive environments factor value.

6.3.4.3Sum the factor values for actual contamination and potential contamination. Do not round this sum, designated as EB, to the nearest integer.

Because the pathway score based solely on sensitive environments is limited to a maximum of 60, use the value EB to determine the value for the sensitive environments factor as follows:

- Multiply the values assigned to likelihood of release (LR), waste characteristics (WC), and EB. Divide the product by 82,500.

Enter the value assigned for the sensitive environments factor in table 6-1.
