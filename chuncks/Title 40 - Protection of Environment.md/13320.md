(ii)(A) Letter dated June 28, 1989, from the Administrator of the Louisiana Office of Air Quality, giving assurances that the State has resources and plans necessary to strive toward attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone taking into account the influence of this Bubble on air quality.

(53) On May 5, 1986, the Governor submitted a request to revise the Louisiana SIP to include an alternate Emission Reduction Plan for the American Cyanamid Company Fortier Plant located at Westwego, Jefferson Parish. A permit was issued by LDEQ on October 17, 1984 (#1896), but after several revisions, the final permit for the trade is #1896 (M-2), issued July 20, 1989. This Bubble uses credits obtained from the change of service of three storage tanks from VOC to non-VOC usage to offset reductions required by controlling one methanol storage tank.
