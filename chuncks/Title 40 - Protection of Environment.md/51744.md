####### Sendout

means, in the context of a local distribution company, the total deliveries of natural gas to customers over a specified time interval (typically hour, day, month, or year). Sendout is the sum of gas received through the city gate, gas withdrawn from on-system storage or peak shaving plants, and gas produced and delivered into the distribution system; and is net of any natural gas injected into on-system storage. It comprises gas sales, exchange, deliveries, gas used by company, and unaccounted for gas. Sendout is measured at the city gate station, and other on-system receipt points from storage, peak shaving, and production.
