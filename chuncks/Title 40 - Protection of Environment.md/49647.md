######### Calculation of allocation.

(b)For each control period for which a CAIR NOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOallowances, the permitting authority will allocate in accordance with the following procedures, if provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with § 51.123(p)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this chapter and approved by the Administrator:

(1) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOallowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR NOopt-in unit's baseline heat input determined under § 97.184(c); or

(ii) The CAIR NOopt-in unit's heat input, as determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part, for the immediately prior control period, except when the allocation is being calculated for the control period in which the CAIR NOopt-in unit enters the CAIR NOAnnual Trading Program under § 97.184(g).

(2) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOallowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(i) The CAIR NOopt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.184(d) and multiplied by 70 percent; or

(ii) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOopt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR NOallowances are to be allocated.

(3) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOallowances to the CAIR NOopt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section and if the CAIR designated representative requests, and the permitting authority issues a CAIR opt-in permit (based on a demonstration of the intent to repower stated under § 97.183(a)(5)) providing for, allocation to a CAIR NOopt-in unit of CAIR NOallowances under this paragraph (subject to the conditions in §§ 97.184(h) and 97.186(g)), the permitting authority will allocate to the CAIR NOopt-in unit as follows, if provided in a State implementation plan revision submitted in accordance with (51.123(p)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this chapter and approved by the Administrator:

(1) For each control period in 2009 through 2014 for which the CAIR NOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOallowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOallowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating CAIR NOallowance allocations will be the lesser of:

(A) The CAIR NOopt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.184(d); or

(B) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOopt-in unit at any time during the control period in which the CAIR NOopt-in unit enters the CAIR NOAnnual Trading Program under § 97.184(g).

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOallowances to the CAIR NOopt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(2) For each control period in 2015 and thereafter for which the CAIR NOopt-in unit is to be allocated CAIR NOallowances,

(i) The heat input (in mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOallowance allocations will be determined as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) The NOemission rate (in lb/mmBtu) used for calculating the CAIR NOallowance allocation will be the lesser of:

(A) 0.15 lb/mmBtu;

(B) The CAIR NOopt-in unit's baseline NOemissions rate (in lb/mmBtu) determined under § 97.184(d); or

(C) The most stringent State or Federal NOemissions limitation applicable to the CAIR NOopt-in unit at any time during the control period for which CAIR NOallowances are to be allocated.

(iii) The permitting authority will allocate CAIR NOallowances to the CAIR NOopt-in unit in an amount equaling the heat input under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, multiplied by the NOemission rate under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, divided by 2,000 lb/ton, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.
