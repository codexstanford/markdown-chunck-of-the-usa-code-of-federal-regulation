####### Hydrogen fluoride production

means a process engaged in the production and recovery of hydrogen fluoride by reacting calcium fluoride with sulfuric acid. For the purpose of implementing this subpart, hydrogen fluoride production is not a process that produces gaseous hydrogen fluoride for direct reaction with hydrated aluminum to form aluminum fluoride (i.e., the hydrogen fluoride is not recovered as an intermediate or final product prior to reacting with the hydrated aluminum).
