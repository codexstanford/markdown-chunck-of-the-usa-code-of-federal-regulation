####### Dewpoint

means a measure of humidity stated as the equilibrium temperature at which water condenses under a given pressure from moist air with a given absolute humidity. Dewpoint is specified as a temperature in &#xB0;C or K, and is valid only for the pressure at which it is measured. See ยง 1065.645 to determine water vapor mole fractions from dewpoints using the pressure at which the dewpoint is measured.
