####### First 30-day production.

(i)For the collection of fugitive emissions components at a well site, where the total production of the well site is at or below 15 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day for the first 30 days of production, according to ยง 60.5415a(j), you must comply with the provisions of either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(1)(i), the calculation must be performed within 45 days of the end of the first 30 days of production. To convert gas production to equivalent barrels of oil, divide the cubic feet of gas produced by 6,000. For well sites that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification between October 15, 2019, and November 16, 2020, the owner or operator may use the records of the first 30 days of production after becoming subject to this subpart, if available, to determine if the total well site production is at or below 15 boe per day, provided this determination is completed by December 14, 2020.
