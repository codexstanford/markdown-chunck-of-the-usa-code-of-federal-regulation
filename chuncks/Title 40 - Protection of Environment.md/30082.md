######## Feedstream analysis plan.

(2)You must develop and implement a feedstream analysis plan and record it in the operating record. The plan must specify at a minimum:

(i) The parameters for which you will analyze each feedstream to ensure compliance with the operating parameter limits of this section;

(ii) Whether you will obtain the analysis by performing sampling and analysis or by other methods, such as using analytical information obtained from others or using other published or documented data or information;

(iii) How you will use the analysis to document compliance with applicable feedrate limits (e.g., if you blend hazardous wastes and obtain analyses of the wastes prior to blending but not of the blended, as-fired, waste, the plan must describe how you will determine the pertinent parameters of the blended waste);

(iv) The test methods which you will use to obtain the analyses;

(v) The sampling method which you will use to obtain a representative sample of each feedstream to be analyzed using sampling methods described in appendix IX, part 266 of this chapter, or an equivalent method; and

(vi) The frequency with which you will review or repeat the initial analysis of the feedstream to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up to date.
