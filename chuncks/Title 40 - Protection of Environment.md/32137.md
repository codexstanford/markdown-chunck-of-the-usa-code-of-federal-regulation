####### Emission standards.

(a)For each storage vessel located at a new or existing affected source that has a capacity of greater than or equal to 20,000 gallons, but less than 40,000 gallons, and vapor pressure of 1.9 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or greater; has a capacity of greater than or equal to 40,000 gallons, but less than 90,000 gallons, and vapor pressure of 0.75 psia or greater; or has a capacity of 90,000 gallons or greater and vapor pressure of 0.15 psia or greater, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. As an alternative to complying with paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may comply with paragraph (b) of this section.

(1) Reduce emissions of total organic HAP by 95 weight-percent. Control shall be achieved by venting emissions through a closed vent system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS (national emission standards for closed vent systems, control devices, recovery devices and routing to a fuel gas system or a process). When complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, the following apply for purposes of this subpart:

(i) Design evaluations are allowed for control devices that control emission points with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP per year before control (i.e., small control devices).

(ii) When 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS refers to specific test methods for the measurement of organic HAP concentration, the test methods presented in ยง 63.1414(a) shall be used.

(iii) The option to measure TOC instead of organic HAP, as a basis for demonstrating compliance, is not allowed.

(iv) Excused excursions are not allowed.

(v) The provisions in ยง 63.1403(b), rather than the provisions in ยง 63.982(f), are to be followed for combined vent streams.

(vi) When a scrubber is used as a control device, the owner or operator shall follow the guidance provided in this subpart for design evaluations or performance tests, as appropriate, and for monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.

(vii) When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, reports shall be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.

(viii) When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and reporting requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of requirements (i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS for emission points covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and follow the requirements of this subpart for emission points covered by this subpart) or shall follow the set of requirements they prefer. If an owner or operator chooses to follow just one set of requirements, the owner or operator shall identify which set of requirements are being followed and which set of requirements are being disregarded in the appropriate report.

(2) Comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW (national emission standards for storage vessels (control level 2)). When complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW, the following apply for purposes of this subpart:

(i) When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and this subpart, reports shall be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.

(ii) When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and reporting requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and this subpart, the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of requirements (i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW for emission points covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and follow the requirements of this subpart for emission points covered by this subpart) or shall follow the set of requirements they prefer. If an owner or operator chooses to follow just one set of requirements, the owner or operator shall identify which set of requirements are being followed and which set of requirements are being disregarded in the appropriate report.
