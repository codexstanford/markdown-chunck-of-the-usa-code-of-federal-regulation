(ii) For testing with torque measurement at the wheel hubs, use Eq. 1037.550-8 settingequal to 1.

(iii) For testing with torque measurement at the engine's crankshaft:

(5) Calculate engine idle speed, by taking the average engine speed measured during the transient cycle test while the vehicle speed is below 0.100 m/s. (Note: Use all the charge-sustaining test intervals when determining engine idle speed for plug-in hybrid engines and powertrains.)

(6) For the cruise cycles specified in ยง 1037.510(a)(2)(ii), calculate the average powertrain output speed,, and the average powertrain output torque (positive torque only),, at vehicle speed at or above 0.100 m/s. (Note: Use all the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting test intervals when determiningandfor plug-in hybrid engines and powertrains.)
