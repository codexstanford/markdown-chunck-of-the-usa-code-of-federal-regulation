####### Frequency of measurement and sampling.

(3)If you estimate emissions based on monitoring of equipment, conduct monitoring at least annually. Sample at least one-third of equipment annually (except for equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor, difficult-to-monitor, insulated, or in heavy liquid service, pumps with dual mechanical seals, agitators with dual mechanical seals, pumps with no external shaft, agitators with no external shaft, pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service with an upstream rupture disk, sampling connection systems with closed-loop or closed purge systems, and pieces of equipment whose leaks are routed through a closed vent system to a destruction device), changing the sample each year such that at the end of three years, all equipment in the process has been monitored. If you estimate emissions based on a sample of the equipment in the process, ensure that the sample is representative of the equipment in the process. If you have multiple processes that have similar types of equipment in similar service, and that produce or transform similar fluorinated GHGs (in terms of chemical composition, molecular weight, and vapor pressure) at similar pressures and concentrations, then you may annually sample all of the equipment in one third of these processes rather than one third of the equipment in each process.
