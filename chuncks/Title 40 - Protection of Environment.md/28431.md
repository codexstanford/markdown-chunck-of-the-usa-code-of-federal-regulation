###### § 63.850 Notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.
####### Recordkeeping.

(e)The owner or operator shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by § 63.10(b) and by this subpart.

(1) The owner or operator must retain each record for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. The most recent 2 years of records must be retained at the facility. The remaining 3 years of records may be retained offsite;

(2) The owner or operator may retain records on microfilm, on a computer, on computer disks, on magnetic tape, or on microfiche;

(3) The owner or operator may report required information on paper or on a labeled computer disc using commonly available and compatible computer software; and

(4) In addition to the general records required by § 63.10(b), the owner or operator shall maintain records of the following information:

(i) Daily production rate of aluminum;

(ii) Daily production rate of green anode material placed in the anode bake furnace;

(iii) [Reserved]

(iv) Records of design information for paste production plant capture systems;

(v) Records of design information for an alternative emission control device for a paste production plant;

(vi) Records supporting the monitoring of similar potlines demonstrating that the performance of similar potlines is the same as or better than that of potlines sampled by manual methods;

(vii) Records supporting a request for reduced sampling of potlines;

(viii) Records supporting the correlation of emissions measured by a continuous emission monitoring system to emissions measured by manual methods and the derivation of the alternative emission limit derived from the measurements;

(ix) The current implementation plan for emission averaging and any subsequent amendments;

(x) Records, such as a checklist or the equivalent, demonstrating that the daily inspection of a potline with wet roof scrubbers for secondary emission control has been performed as required in § 63.848(f)(5)(ii), including the results of each inspection;

(xi) Records, such as a checklist or the equivalent, demonstrating that the daily visual inspection of the exhaust stack for each control device has been performed as required in § 63.848(g), including the results of each inspection;

(xii) For a potline equipped with an HF continuous emission monitor, records of information and data required by § 63.10(c);

(xiii) Records documenting the corrective actions taken when the limit(s) for an operating parameter established under § 63.847(h) were exceeded, when visible emissions indicating abnormal operation were observed from a control device stack during a daily inspection required under § 63.848(g), or when a problem was detected during the daily inspection of a wet roof scrubber for potline secondary control required in § 63.848(f)(5)(ii);

(xiv) Records documenting any POM data that are invalidated due to the installation and startup of a cathode;

(xv) Records documenting the portion of TF that is measured as particulate matter and the portion that is measured as gaseous when the particulate and gaseous fractions are quantified separately using an approved test method;
