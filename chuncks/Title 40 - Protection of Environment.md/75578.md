###### Closed-top hopper

means a completely enclosed storage vessel used to transport dry bulk cargos, either by truck, rail, or barge. Closed-top hoppers are not designed or constructed to carry liquid cargos and are typically used to transport grain, soybeans, soy meal, soda ash, lime, fertilizer, plastic pellets, flour, sugar, and similar commodities or cargos. The cargos transported come in direct contact with the hopper interior. Closed-top hoppers are also commonly referred to as dry bulk hoppers.
