####### Procedure,Number and sex of animals.

(3)-(i)Each treated and control group shall include at least 5 analyzable animals per sex (techniques described in the reference under paragraph (g)(7) of this section may be used). If at the time of the study there are data available from studies in the same species and using the same route of exposure that demonstrate that there are no substantial differences between sexes in toxicity, then testing in a single sex will be sufficient. Where human exposure to chemicals may be sex-specific, as for example with some pharmaceutical agents, the test should be performed with animals of the appropriate sex.
