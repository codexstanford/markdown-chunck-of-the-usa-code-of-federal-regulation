####### Controls.

(vii)Every test requires a control that consists of the same dilution water, conditions, procedures, and test organisms from the same group used in the other test chambers, except that none of the test substance is added. If a carrier (solvent) is used, a separate carrier control is required in addition to the regular control. The carrier control shall be identical to the regular control except that the highest amount of carrier present in any treatment is added to this control. If the test substance is a mixture, formulation, or commercial product, none of the ingredients is considered a carrier unless an extra amount is used to prepare the stock solution.
