######## Polishing with machines

means an operation which removes fine excess metal from a surface to prepare the surface for more refined finishing procedures prior to plating or other processes. Polishing may also be employed to remove burrs on castings or stampings. Polishing is performed using hard-faced wheels constructed of muslin, canvas, felt or leather, and typically employs natural or artificial abrasives. Polishing performed by hand without machines or in bench top operations are not considered polishing with machines for the purposes of this subpart.
