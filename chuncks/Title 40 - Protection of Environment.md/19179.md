(iv) Serial number.

(3) The permanent label must:

(i) Be affixed in a readily visible or readily accessible location in such a manner that it can be easily viewed before and after the appliance is installed (an easily-removable facade may be used for aesthetic purposes, however the bottom of a free-standing heater is not considered to be readily visible or readily accessible);

(iii) Be made of a material expected to last the lifetime of the wood heater;

(iv) Present the required information in a manner so that it is likely to remain legible for the lifetime of the wood heater; and

(v) Be affixed in such a manner that it cannot be removed from the appliance without damage to the label.

(4) The permanent label may be combined with any other label, as long as the required information is displayed, the integrity of the permanent label is not compromised, and the permanent label meets the requirements in ยง 60.536(a)(3).

(5) Any label statement under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section constitutes a representation by the manufacturer as to any wood heater that bears it:

(i) That a certification of compliance was in effect at the time the wood heater left the possession of the manufacturer;

(ii) That the manufacturer was, at the time the label was affixed, conducting a quality assurance program in conformity with ยง 60.533(m); and

(iii) That all wood heaters individually tested for emissions by the manufacturer under its quality assurance program pursuant to ยง 60.533(m) met the applicable emissions limits.
