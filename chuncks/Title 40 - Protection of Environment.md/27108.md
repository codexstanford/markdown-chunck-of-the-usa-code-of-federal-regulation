####### Performance test for flares.

(e)When a flare is used to comply with ยง 63.562(b)(2), (3), and (4), (c)(3) and (4), and (d)(2), the source must demonstrate that the flare meets the requirements of ยง 63.11 of subpart A of this part. In addition, a performance test according to Method 22 of appendix A of part 63 shall be performed to determine visible emissions. The observation period shall be at least 2 hours and shall be conducted according to Method 22. Performance testing shall be conducted during three complete loading cycles with a separate test run for each loading cycle. The observation period for detecting visible emissions shall encompass each loading cycle. Integrated sampling to measure process vent stream flow rate shall be performed continuously during each loading cycle. The owner or operator shall record all visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, maximum permitted velocity calculations, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test.
