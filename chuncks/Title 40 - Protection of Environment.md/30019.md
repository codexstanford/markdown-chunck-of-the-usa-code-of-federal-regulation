####### § 63.1207 What are the performance testing requirements?
######## Content of comprehensive performance test plan.

(1)(i) An analysis of each feedstream, including hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks, as fired, that includes:

(A) Heating value, levels of ash (for hazardous waste incinerators only), levels of semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, mercury, and total chlorine (organic and inorganic); and

(B) Viscosity or description of the physical form of the feedstream;

(ii) For organic hazardous air pollutants established by 42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(1), excluding caprolactam (CAS number 105602) as provided by § 63.60:

(A) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, an identification of such organic hazardous air pollutants that are present in each hazardous waste feedstream. You need not analyze for organic hazardous air pollutants that would reasonably not be expected to be found in the feedstream. You must identify any constituents you exclude from analysis and explain the basis for excluding them. You must conduct the feedstream analysis according to § 63.1208(b)(8);

(B) An approximate quantification of such identified organic hazardous air pollutants in the hazardous waste feedstreams, within the precision produced by analytical procedures of § 63.1208(b)(8); and

(C) A description of blending procedures, if applicable, prior to firing the hazardous waste feedstream, including a detailed analysis of the materials prior to blending, and blending ratios.

(D) The Administrator may approve on a case-by-case basis a hazardous waste feedstream analysis for organic hazardous air pollutants in lieu of the analysis required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if the reduced analysis is sufficient to ensure that the POHCs used to demonstrate compliance with the applicable DRE standards of this subpart continue to be representative of the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste feedstreams;

(iii) A detailed engineering description of the hazardous waste combustor, including:

(A) Manufacturer's name and model number of the hazardous waste combustor;

(B) Type of hazardous waste combustor;

(C) Maximum design capacity in appropriate units;

(D) Description of the feed system for each feedstream;

(E) Capacity of each feed system;

(F) Description of automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system(s);

(G) Description of the design, operation, and maintenance practices for any air pollution control system; and

(H) Description of the design, operation, and maintenance practices of any stack gas monitoring and pollution control monitoring systems;

(iv) A detailed description of sampling and monitoring procedures including sampling and monitoring locations in the system, the equipment to be used, sampling and monitoring frequency, and planned analytical procedures for sample analysis;

(v) A detailed test schedule for each hazardous waste for which the performance test is planned, including date(s), duration, quantity of hazardous waste to be burned, and other relevant factors;

(vi) A detailed test protocol, including, for each hazardous waste identified, the ranges of hazardous waste feedrate for each feed system, and, as appropriate, the feedrates of other fuels and feedstocks, and any other relevant parameters that may affect the ability of the hazardous waste combustor to meet the emission standards;

(vii) A description of, and planned operating conditions for, any emission control equipment that will be used;

(viii) Procedures for rapidly stopping the hazardous waste feed and controlling emissions in the event of an equipment malfunction;

(ix) A determination of the hazardous waste residence time as required by § 63.1206(b)(11);

(x) If you are requesting to extrapolate metal feedrate limits from comprehensive performance test levels under §§ 63.1209(l)(1)(v) or 63.1209(n)(2)(vii):

(A) A description of the extrapolation methodology and rationale for how the approach ensures compliance with the emission standards;

(B) Documentation of the historical range of normal (i.e., other than during compliance testing) metals feedrates for each feedstream;

(C) Documentation that the level of spiking recommended during the performance test will mask sampling and analysis imprecision and inaccuracy to the extent that the extrapolated feedrate limits adequately assure compliance with the emission standards;

(xi) If you do not continuously monitor regulated constituents in natural gas, process air feedstreams, and feedstreams from vapor recovery systems under § 63.1209(c)(5), you must include documentation of the expected levels of regulated constituents in those feedstreams;

(xii) Documentation justifying the duration of system conditioning required to ensure the combustor has achieved steady-state operations under performance test operating conditions, as provided by paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section;

(xiii) For cement kilns with in-line raw mills, if you elect to use the emissions averaging provision of this subpart, you must notify the Administrator of your intent in the initial (and subsequent) comprehensive performance test plan, and provide the information required by the emission averaging provision;

(xiv) For preheater or preheater/precalciner cement kilns with dual stacks, if you elect to use the emissions averaging provision of this subpart, you must notify the Administrator of your intent in the initial (and subsequent) comprehensive performance test plan, and provide the information required by the emission averaging provision;

(xv) If you request to use Method 23 for dioxin/furan you must provide the information required under § 63.1208(b)(1)(i)(B);

(xvi) If you are not required to conduct performance testing to document compliance with the mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emission standards under paragraph (m) of this section, you must include with the comprehensive performance test plan documentation of compliance with the provisions of that section.

(xvii) If you propose to use a surrogate for measuring or monitoring gas flowrate, you must document in the comprehensive performance test plan that the surrogate adequately correlates with gas flowrate, as required by paragraph (m)(7) of this section, and § 63.1209(j)(2), (k)(3), (m)(2)(i), (n)(5)(i), and (o)(2)(i).

(xviii) You must submit an application to request alternative monitoring under § 63.1209(g)(1) not later than with the comprehensive performance test plan, as required by § 63.1209(g)(1)(iii)(A).

(xix) You must document the temperature location measurement in the comprehensive performance test plan, as required by §§ 63.1209(j)(1)(i) and 63.1209(k)(2)(i).

(xx) If your source is equipped with activated carbon injection, you must document in the comprehensive performance test plan:

(A) The manufacturer specifications for minimum carrier fluid flowrate or pressure drop, as required by § 63.1209(k)(6)(ii); and

(B) Key parameters that affect carbon adsorption, and the operating limits you establish for those parameters based on the carbon used during the performance test, if you elect not to specify and use the brand and type of carbon used during the comprehensive performance test, as required by § 63.1209(k)(6)(iii).

(xxi) If your source is equipped with a carbon bed system, and you elect not to specify and use the brand and type of carbon used during the comprehensive performance test, you must include in the comprehensive performance test plan key parameters that affect carbon adsorption, and the operating limits you establish for those parameters based on the carbon used during the performance test, as required by § 63.1209(k)(7)(ii).

(xxii) If you feed a dioxin/furan inhibitor into the combustion system, you must document in the comprehensive performance test plan key parameters that affect the effectiveness of the inhibitor, and the operating limits you establish for those parameters based on the inhibitor fed during the performance test, if you elect not to specify and use the brand and type of inhibitor used during the comprehensive performance test, as required by § 63.1209(k)(9)(ii).
