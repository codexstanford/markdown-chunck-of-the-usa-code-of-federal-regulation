means relating to the test interval of a plug-in hybrid engine or powertrain in which the engine or powertrain consumes electric energy from the RESS that has been charged from an external power source until the RESS is depleted to the point that a test interval qualifies as charge-sustaining. The engine might consume fuel to produce power during a charge-depleting test interval.
