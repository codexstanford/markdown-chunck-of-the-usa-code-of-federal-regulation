###### Painting-Immersion (Including Electrophoretic, "E-coat")

involves applying an organic coating to a part using processes such autophoretic and electrophoretic painting.

(1) Autophoretic Painting involves applying an organic paint film by electrophoresis when a part is immersed in a suitable aqueous bath.

(2) Electrophoretic Painting is coating a part by making it either anodic or cathodic in a bath that is generally an aqueous emulsion of the organic coating material.

(3) Other Immersion Painting includes all other types of immersion painting such as dip painting.

Water is used in immersion paint operations as a carrier for paint particles and to rinse the part. Aqueous painting solutions and rinses typically are treated through an ultrafiltration system. The concentrate is returned to the painting solution, and the permeate is reused as rinse water. Sites typically discharge a bleed stream to treatment. The painting solution and rinses are batch discharged periodically to treatment.
