####### § 63.11225 What are my notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements?
######## www.epa.gov/cdx

(vi) The notification must be submitted electronically using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (). However, if the reporting form specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, the written Notification of Compliance Status must be submitted to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.

(5) If you are using data from a previously conducted emission test to serve as documentation of conformance with the emission standards and operating limits of this subpart, you must include in the Notification of Compliance Status the date of the test and a summary of the results, not a complete test report, relative to this subpart.

(b) You must prepare, by March 1 of each year, and submit to the delegated authority upon request, an annual compliance certification report for the previous calendar year containing the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. You must submit the report by March 15 if you had any instance described by paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For boilers that are subject only to the energy assessment requirement and/or a requirement to conduct a biennial or 5-year tune-up according to § 63.11223(a) and not subject to emission limits or operating limits, you may prepare only a biennial or 5-year compliance report as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) Company name and address.

(2) Statement by a responsible official, with the official's name, title, phone number, email address, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy and completeness of the notification and a statement of whether the source has complied with all the relevant standards and other requirements of this subpart. Your notification must include the following certification(s) of compliance, as applicable, and signed by a responsible official:

(i) "This facility complies with the requirements in § 63.11223 to conduct a biennial or 5-year tune-up, as applicable, of each boiler."

(ii) For units that do not qualify for a statutory exemption as provided in section 129(g)(1) of the Clean Air Act: "No secondary materials that are solid waste were combusted in any affected unit."

(iii) "This facility complies with the requirement in §§ 63.11214(d) and 63.11223(g) to minimize the boiler's time spent during startup and shutdown and to conduct startups and shutdowns according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures or procedures specified for a boiler of similar design if manufacturer's recommended procedures are not available."

(3) If the source experiences any deviations from the applicable requirements during the reporting period, include a description of deviations, the time periods during which the deviations occurred, and the corrective actions taken.

(4) The total fuel use by each affected boiler subject to an emission limit, for each calendar month within the reporting period, including, but not limited to, a description of the fuel, whether the fuel has received a non-waste determination by you or EPA through a petition process to be a non-waste under § 241.3(c), whether the fuel(s) were processed from discarded non-hazardous secondary materials within the meaning of § 241.3, and the total fuel usage amount with units of measure.

(c) You must maintain the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section.

(1) As required in § 63.10(b)(2)(xiv), you must keep a copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart and all documentation supporting any Initial Notification or Notification of Compliance Status that you submitted.

(2) You must keep records to document conformance with the work practices, emission reduction measures, and management practices required by § 63.11214 and § 63.11223 as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.

(i) Records must identify each boiler, the date of tune-up, the procedures followed for tune-up, and the manufacturer's specifications to which the boiler was tuned.

(ii) For operating units that combust non-hazardous secondary materials that have been determined not to be solid waste pursuant to § 241.3(b)(1) of this chapter, you must keep a record which documents how the secondary material meets each of the legitimacy criteria under § 241.3(d)(1). If you combust a fuel that has been processed from a discarded non-hazardous secondary material pursuant to § 241.3(b)(4) of this chapter, you must keep records as to how the operations that produced the fuel satisfies the definition of processing in § 241.2 and each of the legitimacy criteria in § 241.3(d)(1) of this chapter. If the fuel received a non-waste determination pursuant to the petition process submitted under § 241.3(c) of this chapter, you must keep a record that documents how the fuel satisfies the requirements of the petition process. For operating units that combust non-hazardous secondary materials as fuel per § 241.4, you must keep records documenting that the material is a listed non-waste under § 241.4(a).

(iii) For each boiler required to conduct an energy assessment, you must keep a copy of the energy assessment report.

(iv) For each boiler subject to an emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must keep records of monthly fuel use by each boiler, including the type(s) of fuel and amount(s) used. For each new oil-fired boiler that meets the requirements of § 63.11210(e) or (f), you must keep records, on a monthly basis, of the type of fuel combusted.

(v) For each boiler that meets the definition of seasonal boiler, you must keep records of days of operation per year.

(vi) For each boiler that meets the definition of limited-use boiler, you must keep a copy of the federally enforceable permit that limits the annual capacity factor to less than or equal to 10 percent and records of fuel use for the days the boiler is operating.

(3) For sources that demonstrate compliance through fuel analysis, a copy of all calculations and supporting documentation that were done to demonstrate compliance with the mercury emission limits. Supporting documentation should include results of any fuel analyses. You can use the results from one fuel analysis for multiple boilers provided they are all burning the same fuel type.

(4) Records of the occurrence and duration of each malfunction of the boiler, or of the associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment.

(5) Records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with the general duty to minimize emissions in § 63.11205(a), including corrective actions to restore the malfunctioning boiler, air pollution control, or monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.

(6) You must keep the records of all inspection and monitoring data required by §§ 63.11221 and 63.11222, and the information identified in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (vi) of this section for each required inspection or monitoring.

(i) The date, place, and time of the monitoring event.

(ii) Person conducting the monitoring.

(iii) Technique or method used.

(iv) Operating conditions during the activity.

(v) Results, including the date, time, and duration of the period from the time the monitoring indicated a problem to the time that monitoring indicated proper operation.

(vi) Maintenance or corrective action taken (if applicable).

(7) If you use a bag leak detection system, you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Records of the bag leak detection system output.

(ii) Records of bag leak detection system adjustments, including the date and time of the adjustment, the initial bag leak detection system settings, and the final bag leak detection system settings.

(iii) The date and time of all bag leak detection system alarms, and for each valid alarm, the time you initiated corrective action, the corrective action taken, and the date on which corrective action was completed.

(d) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review. You must keep each record for 5 years following the date of each recorded action. You must keep each record on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that instantly provide access at the site for at least 2 years after the date of each recorded action. You may keep the records off site for the remaining 3 years.

(e)(1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, following the procedure specified in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
