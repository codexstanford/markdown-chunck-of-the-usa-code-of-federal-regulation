This would limit any dewpoint-related change in PM to less than +/-2%, even for PM that is 50% sulfuric acid. If you know your expected fraction of sulfuric acid in PM, we recommend that you select an appropriate dewpoint tolerance for showing compliance with emission standards using Table 1 of ยง 1065.190 as a guide:
