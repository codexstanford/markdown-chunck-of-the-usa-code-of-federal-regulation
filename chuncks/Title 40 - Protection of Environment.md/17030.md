####### Concrete protective coating

means a high-build coating, formulated and recommended, for application in a single coat over concrete, plaster, or other cementitious surfaces. These coatings are formulated to be primerless, one-coat systems that can be applied over form oils and/or uncured concrete. These coatings prevent spalling of concrete in freezing temperatures by providing long-term protection from water and chloride ion intrusion.
