####### § 63.1506 Operating requirements.
######## Feed/charge weight.

(d)The owner or operator of each affected source or emission unit subject to an emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton) or µg/Mg (gr/ton) of feed/charge must:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, install and operate a device that measures and records or otherwise determine the weight of feed/charge (or throughput) for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test; and

(2) Operate each weight measurement system or other weight determination procedure in accordance with the OM&M plan.

(3) The owner or operator may chose to measure and record aluminum production weight from an affected source or emission unit rather than feed/charge weight to an affected source or emission unit, provided that:

(i) The aluminum production weight, rather than feed/charge weight is measured and recorded for all emission units within a SAPU; and

(ii) All calculations to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for SAPUs are based on aluminum production weight rather than feed/charge weight.
