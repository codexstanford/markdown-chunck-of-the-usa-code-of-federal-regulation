####### Rim seal

means a device attached to the rim of a floating roof deck that spans the annular space between the deck and the wall of the storage vessel. When a floating roof has only one such device, it is a primary seal; when there are two seals (one mounted above the other), the lower seal is the primary seal and the upper seal is the secondary seal.
