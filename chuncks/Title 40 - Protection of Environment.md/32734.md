######## In-line fluxer.

(k)The owner or operator of an in-line fluxer with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must:

(1) If a bag leak detection system is used to meet the monitoring requirements in ยง 63.1510,

(i) Initiate corrective action within 1-hour of a bag leak detection system alarm and complete the corrective action procedures in accordance with the OM&M plan.

(ii) Operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month block reporting period. In calculating this operating time fraction, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If the owner or operator takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by the owner or operator to initiate corrective action.

(2) If a continuous opacity monitoring system is used to meet the monitoring requirements in ยง 63.1510, initiate corrective action within 1 hour of any 6-minute average reading of 5 percent or more opacity and complete the corrective action procedures in accordance with the OM&M plan.

(3) For a continuous injection system, maintain free-flowing lime in the hopper to the feed device at all times and maintain the lime feeder setting at or above the level established during the performance test.

(4) Maintain the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test at or below the average rate established during the performance test.
