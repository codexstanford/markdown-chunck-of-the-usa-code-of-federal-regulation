####### Small business concern

means a manufacturer or processor who meets the size standards identified in the following table. The number of employees indicates the maximum allowed for a manufacturer or processor to be considered small. If the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of a manufacturer or processor is not represented in the table, it will be considered small if it has 500 or fewer employees. When calculating the number of employees, a manufacturer or processor must include the employees of all of its "parent companies" (if any) and all companies it "owns or controls," as defined by 40 CFR 704.3. The number of employees are calculated as the average number of people employed for each pay period of the business' latest 12 calendar months, regardless of hours worked or temporary status.
