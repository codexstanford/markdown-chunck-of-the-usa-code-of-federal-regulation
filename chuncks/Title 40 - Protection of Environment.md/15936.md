######## Phase C - Blow-off.

(3)(i) Alter the intake of the samplers to sample air from the clean air generation system.

(ii) Sample clean air for one of the required blow-off time durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours).

(iii) Remove the filters from the samplers.

(iv) Weigh the filters immediately and record this weight, FinalWtand FinalWt, where c is the candidate method sampler and r is the reference method sampler.

(v) Calculate the residual mass for the reference method sampler:

(vi) Calculate the corrected residual mass for the candidate method sampler as:

(4) Repeat steps in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section until three repetitions have been completed for each of the required blow-off time durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours).
