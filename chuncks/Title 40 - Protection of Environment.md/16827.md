###### Neighborhood scale

(3)-The neighborhood scale would characterize air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high SOconcentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate SOsources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.
