2.1 What types of PM CEMS technologies are covered? Several different types of PM CEMS technologies (light scattering, Beta attenuation, etc.) can be designed with in-situ or extractive sample gas handling systems. Each PM CEMS technology and sample gas handling technology has certain site-specific advantages. You should select and install a PM CEMS that is appropriate for the flue gas conditions at your source.

2.2 How is PS-11 different from other performance specifications? The PS-11 is based on a technique of correlating PM CEMS responses relative to emission concentrations determined by the reference method. This technique is called "the correlation." This differs from CEMS used to measure gaseous pollutants that have available calibration gases of known concentration. Because the type and characteristics of PM vary from source to source, a single PM correlation, applicable to all sources, is not possible.
