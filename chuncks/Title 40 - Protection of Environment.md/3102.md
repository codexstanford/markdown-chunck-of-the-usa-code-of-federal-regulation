####### ยง 49.103 Delegation of authority of administration to Indian tribes.
######## How is the delegation of administrative authority accomplished

(c)? (1) A Delegation of Authority Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the administrative delegation, will specify the rule and provisions that the tribe shall be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA, and shall be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the tribe. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Regional Administrator and the authorized representative of the tribe have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the tribe will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for assisting us with administration of this FIP and shall act as the Regional Administrator as that term is used in these regulations. Any Delegation of Authority Agreement will clarify the circumstances in which the term "Regional Administrator" found throughout this FIP is to refer only to the EPA Regional Administrator and when it is intended instead to refer to the EPA Regional Administrator or a federally-recognized tribe.

(2) A Delegation of Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with a tribe.
