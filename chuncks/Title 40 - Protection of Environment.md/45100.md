####### Recycle Rate.

3.7The amount of refrigerant processed (in pounds) divided by the time elapsed in the recycling mode in pounds per minute. For equipment which uses a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate does not include the recovery rate (or elapsed time). For equipment which does not use a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate is a maximum rate based solely on the higher of the liquid or vapor recovery rate, by which the rated contaminant levels can be achieved.
