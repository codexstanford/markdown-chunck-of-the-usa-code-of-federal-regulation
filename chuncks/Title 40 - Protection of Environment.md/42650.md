###### ยง 75.31 Initial missing data procedures.
####### Non-load-based volumetric flow and NO,emission rate or NO,concentration data (operational bins not used

(d)). The procedures in this paragraph, (d), apply only to affected units that do not produce electrical output (in megawatts) or thermal output (in klb/hr of steam) and for which operational bins are not used. For each hour of missing volumetric flow rate data, NOemission rate data, or NOconcentration data used to determine NOmass emissions:

(1) Whenever prior quality-assured data exist at the time of the missing data period, the owner or operator shall substitute, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, for each hour of missing data, the arithmetic average of all of the prior quality-assured hourly average flow rates or NOemission rates or NOconcentrations.

(2) Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate, NOemission rate, or NOconcentration data exist, the owner or operator shall, as applicable, substitute for each hour of missing data, the maximum potential flow rate as specified in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part or the maximum potential NOemission rate or the maximum potential NOconcentration as specified in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part.
