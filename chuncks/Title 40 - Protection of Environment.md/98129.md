####### Principle of the test.

(d)(1) The test substance is administered in graduated doses to several groups of males and females. Males should be dosed for a minimum of four weeks and up to and including the day before scheduled sacrifice (this includes a minimum of two weeks prior to mating, during the mating period and, approximately, two weeks post-mating). In view of the limited pre-mating dosing period in males, fertility may not be a particular sensitive indicator of testicular toxicity. Therefore, a detailed histological examination of the testes is essential. The combination of a pre-mating dosing period of two weeks and subsequent mating/fertility observations with an overall dosing period of at least four weeks, followed by detailed histopathology of the male gonads, is considered sufficient to enable detection of the majority of effects on male fertility and spermatogenesis.

(2) Females should be dosed throughout the study. This includes two weeks prior to mating (with the objective of covering at least two complete oestrous cycles), the variable time to conception, the duration of pregnancy and at least four days after delivery, up to and including the day before scheduled sacrifice.

(3) Duration of study, following acclimatization, is dependent on the female performance and is approximately 54 days, (at least 14 days premating, (up to) 14 days mating, 22 days gestation, 4 days lactation).

(4) During the period of administration, the animals are observed closely each day for signs of toxicity. Animals which die or are sacrificed during the test period are necropsied and, at the conclusion of the test, surviving animals are sacrificed and necropsied.
