####### Range-finding test.

(3)(i) A range-finding test should be conducted to establish test solution concentrations for the definitive test.

(ii) The mysids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced concentrations of the test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/l), usually under static conditions.

(iii) A minimum of 10 mysids should be exposed to each concentration of test substance for a period of time which allows estimation of appropriate chronic test concentrations. No replicates are required and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
