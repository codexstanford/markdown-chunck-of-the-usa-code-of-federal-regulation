###### Calibration Drift,2-hour,consecutive

6.2.5(). Using the calibration values obtained at two-hour intervals during the field test, calculate the differences betweentwo-hour readings expressed as ppm. These values should be corrected for the corresponding zero drift during that two-hour period. Calculate the mean and confidence interval of these corrected difference values using Equations D-1 and D-2. Do not use the differences between non-consecutive readings. Report the calibration drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
