###### ยง 430.03 Best management practices (BMPs) for spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine management, spill prevention, and control.
####### Requirement to develop a BMP Plan.

(d)(1) Each mill subject to this section must prepare and implement a BMP Plan. The BMP Plan must be based on a detailed engineering review as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. The BMP Plan must specify the procedures and the practices required for each mill to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the construction the mill determines is necessary to meet those requirements including a schedule for such construction, and the monitoring program (including the statistically derived action levels) that will be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. The BMP Plan also must specify the period of time that the mill determines the action levels established under paragraph (h) of this section may be exceeded without triggering the responses specified in paragraph (i) of this section.

(2) Each mill subject to this section must conduct a detailed engineering review of the pulping and chemical recovery operations-including but not limited to process equipment, storage tanks, pipelines and pumping systems, loading and unloading facilities, and other appurtenant pulping and chemical recovery equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service-for the purpose of determining the magnitude and routing of potential leaks, spills, and intentional diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine during the following periods of operation:

(i) Process start-ups and shut downs;

(ii) Maintenance;

(iii) Production grade changes;

(iv) Storm or other weather events;

(v) Power failures; and

(vi) Normal operations.

(3) As part of the engineering review, the mill must determine whether existing spent pulping liquor containment facilities are of adequate capacity for collection and storage of anticipated intentional liquor diversions with sufficient contingency for collection and containment of spills. The engineering review must also consider:

(i) The need for continuous, automatic monitoring systems to detect and control leaks and spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine;

(ii) The need for process wastewater diversion facilities to protect end-of-pipe wastewater treatment facilities from adverse effects of spills and diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine;

(iii) The potential for contamination of storm water from the immediate process areas; and

(iv) The extent to which segregation and/or collection and treatment of contaminated storm water from the immediate process areas is appropriate.
