###### Test containers.

3.4.10For tests with fish or mysids, use 1-liter glass beakers measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. In conducting the test, add to each beaker 1 liter of the test solution or seawater formulation aerated to saturation with DO. To add the liter volume easily and accurately, use a large volume (1-liter) graduated cylinder. Process all required glassware before each test. Immerse in normal hexane for 10 minutes. Follow this with a thorough rinse with hot tap water; three hot detergent scrubs; an additional hot tap-water rinse; and three rinses with distilled water. Oven or air dry the glassware in a reasonably dust-free atmosphere.
