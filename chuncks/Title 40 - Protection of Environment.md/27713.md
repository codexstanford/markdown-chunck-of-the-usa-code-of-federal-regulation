####### Airless and air-assisted airless spray

mean any coating spray application technology that relies solely on the fluid pressure of the coating to create an atomized coating spray pattern and does not apply any atomizing compressed air to the coating before it leaves the spray gun nozzle. Air-assisted airless spray uses compressed air to shape and distribute the fan of atomized coating, but still uses fluid pressure to create the atomized coating.
