####### Primary exhaust gas sensor monitoring conditions.

(v)(A) The manufacturer must define monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraphs (h)(8)(ii)(A) and (h)(8)(ii)(D) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in paragraphs (h)(8)(ii)(A) and (h)(8)(ii)(D) of this section must be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (h)(8)(v)(C) of this section, monitoring for malfunctions identified in paragraphs (h)(8)(ii)(B) and (h)(8)(ii)(C) of this section must be conducted continuously.

(C) The manufacturer may disable continuous primary exhaust gas sensor monitoring when a primary exhaust gas sensor malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects (e.g., disable out-of-range low monitoring during fuel cut conditions). To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate via data or engineering analyses that a properly functioning sensor cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sensor and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection.
