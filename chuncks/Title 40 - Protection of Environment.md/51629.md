####### Global warming potential or GWP,i.e.,

means the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of one kilogram of a trace substance relative to that of one kilogram of a reference gas (CO). GWPs for each greenhouse gas are provided in Table A-1 of this subpart. For purposes of the calculations in this part, if the GHG has a chemical-specific GWP listed in Table A-1, use that GWP. Otherwise, use the default GWP provided in Table A-1 for the fluorinated GHG group of which the GHG is a member.
