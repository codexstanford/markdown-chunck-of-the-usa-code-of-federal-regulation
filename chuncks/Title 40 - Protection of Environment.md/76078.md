####### Discrete Wet Scrubbing Device.

(i)A discrete wet scrubbing device is a distinct, stand-alone device that removes particulates and fumes from a contaminated gas stream by bringing the gas stream into contact with a scrubber liquor, usually water, and from which there is a wastewater discharge. Examples of discrete wet scrubbing devices are: Spray towers and chambers, venturi scrubbers (fixed and variable), wet caps, packed bed scrubbers, quenchers, and orifice scrubbers. Semi-wet scrubbing devices where water is added and totally evaporates prior to dry air pollution control are not considered to be discrete wet scrubbing devices. Ancillary scrubber operations such as fan washes and backwashes are not considered to be discrete wet scrubber devices. These ancillary operations are covered by the mass limitations of the associated scrubber. Aftercoolers are not considered to be discrete wet scrubbing devices, and water discharges from aftercooling are not regulated as a process wastewater in this category.
