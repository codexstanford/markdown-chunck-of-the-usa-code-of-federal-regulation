###### ยง 1042.315 Determining compliance.
####### Round deteriorated test results.

(3)Round the results to the number of decimal places in the emission standard expressed to one more decimal place.

(b) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, if a production-line engine fails to meet emission standards and you test additional engines as described in ยง 1042.310, calculate the average emission level for each pollutant for all the engines. If the calculated average emission level for any pollutant exceeds the applicable emission standard, the engine family fails the production-line testing requirements of this subpart. Tell us within ten working days if an engine fails. You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the engine family as described in ยง 1042.225(f).
