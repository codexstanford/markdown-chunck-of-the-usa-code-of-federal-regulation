####### Contents.

(2)The owner or operator shall include the following information in the implementation plan or in the application for an operating permit for all emission sources to be included in an emissions average:

(i) The identification of all emission sources (potlines or anode bake furnaces) in the average;

(ii) The assigned TF, POM and/or PM emission limit for each averaging group of potlines and/or anode bake furnaces;

(iii) The specific control technologies or pollution prevention measures to be used for each emission source in the averaging group and the date of its installation or application. If the pollution prevention measures reduce or eliminate emissions from multiple sources, the owner or operator must identify each source;

(iv) The test plan for the measurement of TF, POM and/or PM emissions in accordance with the requirements in ยง 63.847(b);

(v) The operating parameters to be monitored for each control system or device and a description of how the operating limits will be determined;

(vi) If the owner or operator requests to monitor an alternative operating parameter pursuant to ยง 63.848(l):

(A) A description of the parameter(s) to be monitored and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s); and

(B) A description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter indicates proper operation of the control device; the frequency and content of monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements; and a demonstration, to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, that the proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control device operating conditions; and

(vii) A demonstration that compliance with each of the applicable emission limit(s) will be achieved under representative operating conditions.
