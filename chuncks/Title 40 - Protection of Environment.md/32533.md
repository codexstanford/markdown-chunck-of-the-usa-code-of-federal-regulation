####### Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.

(c)Parameter monitoring levels established under this paragraph shall be based on the parameter values measured during the performance test supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values. The information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall be provided in the Notification of Compliance Status.

(1) The specific level of the monitored parameter(s) for each emission point.
