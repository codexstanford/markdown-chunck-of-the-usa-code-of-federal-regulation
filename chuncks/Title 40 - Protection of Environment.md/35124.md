######## Operating scenario

means for a dyeing/finishing process operation or group of process operations, the combination of operating conditions (including but not limited to, type of substrate, type and mass fraction of organic HAP in dyeing/finishing materials applied, and the process operation temperature and pressure) affecting the fraction of organic HAP applied in dyeing and finishing operations discharged to wastewater. For example, a dyeing process operation run at atmospheric pressure would be a different operating scenario from the same dyeing process operation run under pressure.
