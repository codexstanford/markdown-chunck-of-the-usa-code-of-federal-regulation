####### Determination of Failure to Attain:

(h)Effective December 23, 2016, the EPA has determined that the San Joaquin Valley Serious PMnonattainment area failed to attain the 1997 annual and 24-hour PMNAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2015. This determination triggers the requirements of CAA sections 179(d) and 189(d) for the State of California to submit a revision to the California SIP for the San Joaquin Valley to the EPA by December 31, 2016. The SIP revision must, among other elements, demonstrate expeditious attainment of the 1997 PMNAAQS within the time period provided under CAA section 179(d) and that provides for annual reduction in the emissions of direct PMor a PMplan precursor pollutant within the area of not less than five percent until attainment.
