###### ยง 1065.305 Verifications for accuracy, repeatability, and noise.
####### Noise.,rms

(iii)Noise is two times the root-mean-square of the ten standard deviations (that is, noise = 2 &#xB7;) when the reference signal is a zero-quantity signal. Refer to the example of a root-mean-square calculation in ยง 1065.602. We recommend that instrument noise be within the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205.

(10) You may use a measurement instrument that does not meet the accuracy, repeatability, or noise specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205, as long as you meet the following criteria:

(i) Your measurement systems meet all the other required calibration, verification, and validation specifications that apply as specified in the regulations.

(ii) The measurement deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards in this chapter.
