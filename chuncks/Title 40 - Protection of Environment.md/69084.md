####### bona fide,

(ii) For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest in a reasonably expeditious manner an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or may employ the means specified in § 280.210(c)(2). A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a writtenfirm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as provided in § 280.210(c)(2), is not considered to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest.

(2) Holding foreclosed property for disposition and liquidation. A holder, who does not participate in management prior to or after foreclosure, may sell, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures, prior to sale or other disposition, to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. A holder may also arrange for an existing or new operator to continue or initiate operation of the UST or UST system. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the security interest exemption, subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as being for sale or disposition on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil procedure) covering the location of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date that the marketable title or deed has been issued, approved and recorded, and the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to obtain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title or deed or to gain access to the UST or UST system, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the holder first acquires either title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system, or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later.

(ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located are not held primarily to protect the security interest, unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.

(A) Fair consideration, in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest includes all debt and costs incurred by the security interest holder, and is calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure). The value of the security interest also includes all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident to work out, foreclosure, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing, prior to sale, the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or other disposition. The value of the security interest also includes environmental investigation costs (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located), and corrective action costs incurred under §§ 280.51 through 280.67 or any other costs incurred as a result of reasonable efforts to comply with any other applicable federal, state or local law or regulation; less any amounts received by the holder in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower (if not already applied to the borrower's obligations) subsequent to the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in this paragraph (c).
