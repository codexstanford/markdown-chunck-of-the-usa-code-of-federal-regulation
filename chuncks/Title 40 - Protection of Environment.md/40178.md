###### Transfer of Reference Spectra.

3.2To determine whether reference spectra recorded under one set of conditions (e.g., optical bench, instrumental linewidth, absorption pathlength, detector performance, pressure, and temperature) can be used to analyze sample spectra taken under a different set of conditions, quantitatively compare "calibration transfer standards" (CTS) and reference spectra as described in this Protocol.
