######## Increase in an emissions unit's annual allowable emissions limit.

(2)If you propose a physical or operational change at your minor or major source that would increase an emissions unit's allowable emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant above its existing annual allowable emissions limit, you must obtain a permit revision to reflect the increase in the limit prior to making the change. For a physical or operational change that is not otherwise subject to review under major NSR or under this program, such increase in the annual allowable emissions limit may be accomplished through an administrative permit revision as provided in ยง 49.159(f).
