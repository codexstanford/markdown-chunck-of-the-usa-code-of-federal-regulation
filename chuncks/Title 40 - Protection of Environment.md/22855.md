###### Relative Accuracy (RA)

2.7means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant concentrations determined by a continuous monitoring system (e.g., Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system) and the values determined by a reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for sources with an average RM concentration less than 5.0 micrograms per standard cubic meter (Âµg/scm), the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean CEMS and RM values.
