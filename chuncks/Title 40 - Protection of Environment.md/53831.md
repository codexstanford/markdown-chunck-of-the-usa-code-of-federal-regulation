####### Non-water Quality Environmental and Other Impacts Study.

(12)The owner or operator of an existing facility that withdraws greater than 125 mgd AIF must develop for submission to the Director a detailed facility-specific discussion of the changes in non-water quality environmental and other impacts attributed to each technology and operational measure considered in paragraph (r)(10) of this section, including both impacts increased and impacts decreased. The study must include the following:

(i) Estimates of changes to energy consumption, including but not limited to auxiliary power consumption and turbine backpressure energy penalty;

(ii) Estimates of air pollutant emissions and of the human health and environmental impacts associated with such emissions;

(iii) Estimates of changes in noise;

(iv) A discussion of impacts to safety, including documentation of the potential for plumes, icing, and availability of emergency cooling water;

(v) A discussion of facility reliability, including but not limited to facility availability, production of steam, impacts to production based on process unit heating or cooling, and reliability due to cooling water availability;

(vi) Significant changes in consumption of water, including a facility-specific comparison of the evaporative losses of both once-through cooling and closed-cycle recirculating systems, and documentation of impacts attributable to changes in water consumption; and

(vii) A discussion of all reasonable attempts to mitigate each of these factors.
