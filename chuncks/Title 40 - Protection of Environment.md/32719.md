######## Group 1 furnace.

(i)The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace must use the limits in this paragraph to determine the emission standards for a SAPU.

(1) 0.20 kg of PM per Mg (0.40 lb of PM per ton) of feed/charge from a group 1 furnace, that is not a melting/holding furnace processing only clean charge, at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(2) 0.40 kg of PM per Mg (0.80 lb of PM per ton) of feed/charge from a group 1 melting/holding furnace processing only clean charge at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source;

(3) 15 µg of D/F TEQ per Mg (2.1 x 10gr of D/F TEQ per ton) of feed/charge from a group 1 furnace at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major or area source. This limit does not apply if the furnace processes only clean charge; and

(4) 0.20 kg of HF per Mg (0.40 lb of HF per ton) of feed/charge from an uncontrolled group 1 furnace and 0.20 kg of HCl per Mg (0.40 lb of HCl per ton) of feed/charge or, if the furnace is equipped with an add-on air pollution control device, 10 percent of the uncontrolled HCl emissions, by weight, for a group 1 furnace at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source.

(5) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace at a secondary aluminum production facility that is a major source must not discharge or cause to be discharged to the atmosphere visible emissions in excess of 10 percent opacity from any PM add-on air pollution control device if a COM is chosen as the monitoring option.

(6) The owner or operator may determine the emission standards for a SAPU by applying the group 1 furnace limits on the basis of the aluminum production weight in each group 1 furnace, rather than on the basis of feed/charge.

(7) The owner or operator of a sidewell group 1 furnace that conducts reactive fluxing (except for cover flux) in the hearth, or that conducts reactive fluxing in the sidewell at times when the level of molten metal falls below the top of the passage between the sidewell and the hearth, must comply with the emission limits of paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section on the basis of the combined emissions from the sidewell and the hearth.
