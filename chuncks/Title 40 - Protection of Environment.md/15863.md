####### ยง 53.62 Test procedure: Full wind tunnel test.
######## Measure the aerosol with the candidate sampler.

(7)(i) Install the test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum blockage limit of paragraph (c)(1) of this section or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.

(ii) Remove the test sampler from the wind tunnel.

(iii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the test sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for each replicate as:

(iv)(A) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as:

(B) If a single isokinetic sampler is used for the determination of particle mass concentration, replace Cwith C.
