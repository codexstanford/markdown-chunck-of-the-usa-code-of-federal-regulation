####### Charge time.

(k)For electric vehicles, determine the time it takes to fully charge the battery from a 240 volt power source to the point that the battery meets the manufacturer's end-of-charge criteria, consistent with the procedures specified in SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference in ยง 600.011) for electric vehicles and in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in ยง 600.011) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, as described in ยง 600.116. This value may be more or less than the 12-hour minimum charging time specified for testing. You must alternatively specify the charge time based on a standard 120 volt power source if the vehicle cannot be charged at the higher voltage.
