####### DPF regeneration frequency.

(B)The OBD system must detect a malfunction when the DPF regeneration frequency increases from (i.e., occurs more often than) the manufacturer's specified regeneration frequency to a level such that it would cause an engine's NMHC emissions to exceed the emissions threshold for DPF systems as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). If no such regeneration frequency exists that could cause NMHC emissions to exceed the applicable emission threshold, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the DPF regeneration frequency exceeds the manufacturer's specified design limits for allowable regeneration frequency.
