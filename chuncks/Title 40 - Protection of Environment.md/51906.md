###### § 98.43 Calculating GHG emissions.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, continue to monitor and report COmass emissions as required under § 75.13 or section 2.3 of appendix G to 40 CFR part 75, and § 75.64. Calculate CO, CH, and NO emissions as follows:

(1) Convert the cumulative annual COmass emissions reported in the fourth quarter electronic data report required under § 75.64 from units of short tons to metric tons. To convert tons to metric tons, divide by 1.1023.

(2) Calculate and report annual CHand NO mass emissions under this subpart by following the applicable method specified in § 98.33(c).

(b) Calculate and report biogenic COemissions under this subpart by following the applicable methods specified in § 98.33(e). The COemissions (excluding biogenic CO) for units subject to this subpart that are reported under §§ 98.3(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(iii)(B) shall be calculated by subtracting the biogenic COmass emissions calculated according to § 98.33(e) from the cumulative annual COmass emissions from paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Separate calculation and reporting of biogenic COemissions is optional only for the 2010 reporting year pursuant to § 98.3(c)(12) and required every year thereafter.
