####### Engine torque for constant-speed engines.,T,T,T,T

(3)For constant-speed engines, normalized torque is expressed as a percentage of maximum test torque,. Section 1065.610 describes how to transform normalized torques into a sequence of reference torques,. Section 1065.610 also describes under what conditions you may commandgreater than the reference torque you calculated from the normalized duty cycle. This provision permits you to commandvalues that are limited by a declared minimum torque.
