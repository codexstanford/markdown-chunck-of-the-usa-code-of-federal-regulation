###### Exposure components.

5.0.1Evaluate the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on two exposure components:

- Soil exposure component (see section 5.1).

- Subsurface intrusion component (see section 5.2).

Score one or both components considering their relative importance. If only one component is scored, assign its score as the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score. If both components are scored, sum the two scores and assign it as the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, subject to a maximum of 100.
