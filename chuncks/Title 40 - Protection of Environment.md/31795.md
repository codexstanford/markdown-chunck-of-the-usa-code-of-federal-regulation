####### Calculation of percent leakers.

(4)(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the end of the first monitoring period what groups of processes will be developed. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percent calculations shall be made on the same basis.

(ii) If, calculated on a 1-year rolling average, 10 percent or more of the pumps in a group of processes (or 3 pumps in a group of processes with fewer than 30 pumps) leak, the owner or operator shall monitor each pump once per month, until the calculated 1-year rolling average value drops below 10 percent (or three pumps in a group of processes with fewer than 30 pumps).

(iii) The number of pumps in a group of processes shall be the sum of all the pumps in organic HAP service, except that pumps found leaking in a continuous process within 1 quarter after startup of the pump shall not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one monitoring period only.

(iv) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined using Equation 3 of this subpart:
