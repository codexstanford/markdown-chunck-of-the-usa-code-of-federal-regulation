######## Procedure.
######### Procedure.
########## Scope and frequency.

(a)If you use an analyzer that measures only NO to determine NO, you must use an NO-to-NO converter upstream of the analyzer. Perform this verification after installing the converter, after major maintenance and within 35 days before an emission test. This verification must be repeated at this frequency to verify that the catalytic activity of the NO-to-NO converter has not deteriorated.
