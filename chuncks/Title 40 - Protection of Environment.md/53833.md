####### New Units.

(14)The applicant must identify the chosen compliance method for the new unit. In addition, the owner or operator that selects the BTA standards for new units at 40 CFR 125.94 (e)(2) as its route to compliance must submit information to demonstrate entrainment reductions equivalent to 90 percent or greater of the reduction that could be achieved through compliance with 40 CFR 125.94(e)(1). The demonstration must include the Entrainment Characterization Study at paragraph (r)(9) of this section. In addition, if data specific to your facility indicates that compliance with the requirements of ยง 125.94 of this chapter for each new unit would result in compliance costs wholly out of proportion to the costs EPA considered in establishing the requirements at issue, or would result in significant adverse impacts on local air quality, significant adverse impacts on local water resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse impacts on local energy markets, you must submit all supporting data as part of paragraph (r)(14) of this section. The Director may determine that additional data and information, including but not limited to monitoring, must be included as part of paragraph (r)(14) of this section.
