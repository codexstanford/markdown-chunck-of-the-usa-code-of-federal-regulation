###### Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
####### § 63.4141 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
######## Determine the density of each coating.,see

(c)Determine the density of each coating used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM D1475-13, "Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products, ASTM D2111-10 (R2015), "Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity of Halogenated Organic Solvents and Their Admixtures"(both incorporated by reference,§ 63.14); if you use this method, the specific gravity must be corrected to a standard temperature, information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between test results from ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM D2111-10 (R2015) and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence.

(d) Determine the organic HAP content of each coating. Determine the organic HAP content, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids, of each coating used during the compliance period, using Equation 2 of this section, except that if the mass fraction of organic HAP equals zero, then the organic HAP content also equals zero and you are not required to use Equation 2 to calculate the organic HAP content:

(e) The organic HAP content for each coating used during the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090; and each thinner and cleaning material used during the initial compliance period must contain no organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep all records required by §§ 63.4130 and 63.4131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required in § 63.4110, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, and you used no thinners or cleaning materials that contain organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section.
