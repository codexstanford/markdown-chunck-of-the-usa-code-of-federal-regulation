####### Post-manufacture marinizer

means an entity that produces a marine engine by modifying a non-marine engine, whether certified or uncertified, complete or partially complete, where the entity is not controlled by the manufacturer of the base engine or by an entity that also controls the manufacturer of the base engine. In addition, vessel manufacturers that substantially modify marine engines are post-manufacture marinizers. For the purpose of this definition, "substantially modify" means changing an engine in a way that could change engine emission characteristics.
