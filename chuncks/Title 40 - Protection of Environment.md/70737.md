###### Calculations.

3.6.1The LCis the concentration lethal to 50% of the test population. It can be calculated as an interpolated value based on percentages of organisms surviving at two or more concentrations, at which less than half and more than half survived. The LCcan be estimated with the aid of computer programs or graphic techniques (log paper). The 95% confidence intervals for the LCestimate should also be determined.
