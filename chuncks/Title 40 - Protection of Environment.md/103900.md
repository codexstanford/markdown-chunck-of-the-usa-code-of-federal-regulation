(1)Measure and record ambient temperature and humidity in the test cell at least once every 30 seconds during the sampling period. Alternatively, if you collect data of at least once every 12 seconds, you may use a moving average of up to 30 second intervals to measure and record ambient temperature and humidity. Control ambient temperature throughout the test sequence to (35.0 +/- 3.0) &#xB0;C. Control ambient temperature during emission sampling to (33.6 to 36.4) &#xB0;C on average. Control ambient humidity during emission sampling as described in ยง 1066.420(d).
