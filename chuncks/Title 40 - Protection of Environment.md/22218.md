###### 12.6 Effluent Gas Concentration.,e.g.

For each test run, calculate C, the arithmetic average of all valid NOconcentration values (, 1-minute averages). Then adjust the value of Cfor bias using Equation 7E-5a if you use a non-zero gas as your low-level calibration gas, or Equation 7E-5b if you use a zero gas as your low-level calibration gas.
