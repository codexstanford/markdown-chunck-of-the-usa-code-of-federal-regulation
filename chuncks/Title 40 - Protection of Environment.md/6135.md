###### ยง 51.904 How do the classification and attainment date provisions in section 172(a) of subpart 1 of the CAA apply to areas subject to ยง 51.902(b)?
####### Classification.

(a)The Administrator may classify an area subject to ยง 51.902(b) as an overwhelming transport area if:

(1) The area meets the criteria as specified for rural transport areas under section 182(h) of the CAA;

(2) Transport of ozone and/or precursors into the area is so overwhelming that the contribution of local emissions to observed 8-hour ozone concentration above the level of the NAAQS is relatively minor; and

(3) The Administrator finds that sources of VOC (and, where the Administrator determines relevant, NO) emissions within the area do not make a significant contribution to the ozone concentrations measured in other areas.
