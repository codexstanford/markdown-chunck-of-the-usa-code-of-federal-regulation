####### Process vents from continuous unit operations.

(3)The uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for each process vent from a continuous unit operation in a PMPU shall be determined at the location specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, using the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) For process vents subject to either the provisions for epoxide emissions in ยง 63.1425(b) or the provisions for organic HAP emissions from catalyst extraction in ยง 63.1425(d), uncontrolled emissions shall be determined after the exit from the continuous unit operation but before any recovery device.

(ii) The owner or operator shall determine the hourly uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from each process vent from a continuous unit operation in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, except that the emission rate shall be determined at the location specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
