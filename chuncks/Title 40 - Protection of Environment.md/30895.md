###### § 63.1258 Monitoring Requirements.
####### Monitoring for the alternative standards.

(5)(i) For control devices that are used to comply with the provisions of § 63.1253(d) or § 63.1254(c), the owner or operator shall monitor and record the outlet TOC concentration and the outlet hydrogen halide and halogen concentration every 15 minutes during the period in which the device is functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this subpart using CEMS as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) A TOC monitor meeting the requirements of EPA Performance Specification 8, 9, or 15 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 shall be installed, calibrated, and maintained according to § 63.8.

(B) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(C) and (D) of this section, the owner or operator must monitor HCl using either a FTIR CEMS that meets Performance Specification 15 of appendix B of part 60 or any other CEMS capable of measuring HCl for which a performance specification has been promulgated in appendix B of part 60. To monitor HCl with a CEMS for which a performance specification has not been promulgated, the owner or operator must prepare a monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.8.

(C) As an alternative to using a CEMS as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section to monitor halogenated vent streams that are controlled by a combustion device followed by a scrubber, the owner or operator may elect to monitor scrubber operating parameters as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that demonstrate the HCl emissions are reduced by at least 95 percent by weight.

(D) The owner or operator need not monitor the hydrogen halide and halogen concentration if, based on process knowledge, the owner or operator determines that the emission stream does not contain hydrogen halides or halogens.

(ii) An owner or operator complying with the alternative standard using control devices in which supplemental gases are added to the vents or manifolds must either correct for supplemental gases as specified in § 63.1257(a)(3) or comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. If the owner or operator corrects for supplemental gases as specified in § 63.1257(a)(3)(ii) for noncombustion control devices, the flow rates must be evaluated as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section.
