###### What This Subpart Covers
####### ยง 63.5787 What if I also manufacture fiberglass boats or boat parts?

(a) If your source meets the applicability criteria in ยง 63.5785, and is not subject to the Boat Manufacturing NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV), you are subject to this subpart regardless of the final use of the parts you manufacture.

(b) If your source is subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, and all the reinforced plastic composites you manufacture are used in manufacturing your boats, you are not subject to this subpart.

(c) If you are subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, and meet the applicability criteria in ยง 63.5785, and produce reinforced plastic composites that are not used in fiberglass boat manufacture at your facility, all operations associated with the manufacture of the reinforced plastic composites parts that are not used in fiberglass boat manufacture at your facility are subject to this subpart, except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) Facilities potentially subject to both this subpart and 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV may elect to have the operations in paragraph (c) of this section covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, in lieu of this subpart, if they can demonstrate that this will not result in any organic HAP emissions increase compared to complying with this subpart.
