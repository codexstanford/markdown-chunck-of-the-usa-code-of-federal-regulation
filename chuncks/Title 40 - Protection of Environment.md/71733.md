###### Substantial modifications defined.

(b)Substantial modifications include:

(1) Modifications that relax POTW legal authorities (as described in ยง 403.8(f)(1)), except for modifications that directly reflect a revision to this part 403 or to 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, and are reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;

Maximum Allowable Industrial Loading means the total mass of a pollutant that all Industrial Users of a POTW (or a subgroup of Industrial Users identified by the POTW) may discharge pursuant to limits developed under ยง 403.5(c);

(3) Changes to the POTW's control mechanism, as described in ยง 403.8(f)(1)(iii);

(4) A decrease in the frequency of self-monitoring or reporting required of industrial users;

(5) A decrease in the frequency of industrial user inspections or sampling by the POTW;

(6) Changes to the POTW's confidentiality procedures; and

(7) Other modifications designated as substantial modifications by the Approval Authority on the basis that the modification could have a significant impact on the operation of the POTW's Pretreatment Program; could result in an increase in pollutant loadings at the POTW; or could result in less stringent requirements being imposed on Industrial Users of the POTW.
