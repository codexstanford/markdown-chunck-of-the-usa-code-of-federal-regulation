####### Adjustment to an opacity emission standard.

(9)(i) If the Administrator finds under paragraph (h)(8) of this section that an affected source is in compliance with all relevant standards for which initial performance tests were conducted under ยง 63.7, but during the time such performance tests were conducted fails to meet any relevant opacity emission standard, the owner or operator of such source may petition the Administrator to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity emission standard for the affected source. Until the Administrator notifies the owner or operator of the appropriate adjustment, the relevant opacity emission standard remains applicable.

(ii) The Administrator may grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that-

(A) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests;

(B) The performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the Administrator; and

(C) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the relevant opacity emission standard.

(iii) The Administrator will establish an adjusted opacity emission standard for the affected source meeting the above requirements at a level at which the source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, to meet the opacity emission standard at all times during which the source is meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator will promulgate the new opacity emission standard in the

(iv) After the Administrator promulgates an adjusted opacity emission standard for an affected source, the owner or operator of such source shall be subject to the new opacity emission standard, and the new opacity emission standard shall apply to such source during any subsequent performance tests.
