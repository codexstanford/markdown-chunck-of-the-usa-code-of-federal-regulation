### Subchapter N - Effluent Guidelines and Standards
#### PART 403 - GENERAL PRETREATMENT REGULATIONS FOR EXISTING AND NEW SOURCES OF POLLUTION
##### ยง 403.12 Reporting requirements for POTW's and industrial users.
###### Measurement of pollutants.

(5)(i) The user shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process;

(ii) In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the Standard or Control Authority) of regulated pollutants in the Discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by the Control Authority or the applicable Standards to determine compliance with the Standard;

(iii) The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.

(iv) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of ยง 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with ยง 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;

(v) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator;

(vi) The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;

(vii) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW;
