###### Sample Dilution.

8.7.2The sample may be diluted using an in-stack dilution probe, or an external dilution device provided that the sample is not diluted below the instrument's quantification range. As an alternative to using a dilution probe, nitrogen may be dynamically spiked into the effluent stream in the same manner as analyte spiking. A constant dilution rate shall be maintained throughout the measurement process. It is critical to measure and verify the exact dilution ratio when using a dilution probe or the nitrogen spiking approach. Calibrating the system with a calibration gas containing an appropriate tracer compound will allow determination of the dilution ratio for most measurement systems. The tester shall specify the procedures used to determine the dilution ratio, and include these calibration results in the report.
