######## emission limit.

SOThe individual sulfur dioxide emission limit for a unit shall be 0.06 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) as averaged over a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day period. For each unit, SOemissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SOfrom that day and the preceding 29 boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SOby the sum of the heat input during the same 30 boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO. If a valid SOpounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SOpounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO.
