###### § 98.37 Records that must be retained.
####### Verification software records.

(b)For each stationary fuel combustion source that elects to use the verification software specified in § 98.5(b) rather than report data specified in paragraphs (b)(9)(iii), (c)(2)(ix), (e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(C), (e)(2)(ii)(D), (e)(2)(iv)(A), (e)(2)(iv)(C), (e)(2)(iv)(F), and (e)(2)(ix)(D) through (F) of this section, you must keep a record of the file generated by the verification software for the applicable data specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (36) of this section. Retention of this file satisfies the recordkeeping requirement for the data in paragraphs (b)(1) through (36) of this section.

(10) Measured high heat value of each liquid fuel, for month (which may be the arithmetic average of multiple determinations), or, if applicable, an appropriate substitute data value (mmBtu per gallons) (Equation C-2b).

(11) Measured high heat value of each gaseous fuel, for month (which may be the arithmetic average of multiple determinations), or, if applicable, an appropriate substitute data value (mmBtu per scf) (Equation C-2b).

(12) Mass of each solid fuel combusted during month (tons) (Equation C-2b).

(13) Volume of each liquid fuel combusted during month (gallons) (Equation C-2b).

(14) Volume of each gaseous fuel combusted during month (scf) (Equation C-2b).

(15) Total mass of steam generated by municipal solid waste or each solid fuel combustion during the reporting year (pounds steam) (Equation C-2c of § 98.33).

(16) Ratio of the boiler's maximum rated heat input capacity to its design rated steam output capacity (MMBtu/pounds steam) (Equation C-2c).

(18) Annual average carbon content of each solid fuel (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction) (Equation C-3).

(19) Annual volume of each liquid fuel combusted (gallons/year) (Equation C-4 of § 98.33).

(20) Annual average carbon content of each liquid fuel (kg C per gallon of fuel) (Equation C-4).

(23) Annual average molecular weight of each gaseous fuel (kg/kg-mole) (Equation C-5).

(24) Molar volume conversion factor at standard conditions, as defined in § 98.6 (scf per kg-mole) (Equation C-5).

(25) Identify for each fuel if you will use the default high heat value from Table C-1 of this subpart, or actual high heat value data (Equation C-8 of § 98.33).

(26) High heat value of each solid fuel (mmBtu/tons) (Equation C-8).

(27) High heat value of each liquid fuel (mmBtu/gallon) (Equation C-8).
