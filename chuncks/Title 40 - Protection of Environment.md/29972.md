######## Establishing the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance.

(ii)You must establish the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance (i.e., after the compliance date but prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance subsequent to conducting the initial comprehensive performance test) of an existing source as follows:

(A) You must obtain a minimum of three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data, provided in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter, and PMDS data to establish an approximate correlation curve. Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the compliance date may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.

(B) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of your determination whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS.

(C) You must approximate the correlation of the reference method data to the PMDS data.
