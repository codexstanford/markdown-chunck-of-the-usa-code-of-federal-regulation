##### § 403.7 Removal credits.
###### Exception to POTW Pretreatment Program Requirement.

(d)A POTW required to develop a local pretreatment program by § 403.8 may conditionally give removal credits pending approval of such a program in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(1) All Industrial Users who are currently subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard and who wish conditionally to receive a removal credit must submit to the POTW the information required in § 403.12(b)(1) through (7) (except new or modified industrial users must only submit the information required by § 403.12(b)(1) through (6)), pertaining to the categorical Pretreatment Standard as modified by the removal credit. The Industrial Users shall indicate what additional technology, if any, will be needed to comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) as modified by the removal credit;

(2) The POTW must have submitted to the Approval Authority an application for pretreatment program approval meeting the requirements of §§ 403.8 and 403.9 in a timely manner, not to exceed the time limitation set forth in a compliance schedule for development of a pretreatment program included in the POTW's NPDES permit, but in no case later than July 1, 1983, where no permit deadline exists;

(3) The POTW must:

(i) Compile and submit data demonstrating its consistent removal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;

(ii) Comply with the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

(iii) Submit a complete application for removal credit authority in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;

(4) If a POTW receives authority to grant conditional removal credits and the Approval Authority subsequently makes a final determination, after appropriate notice, that the POTW failed to comply with the conditions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the authority to grant conditional removal credits shall be terminated by the Approval Authority and all Industrial Users to whom the revised discharge limits had been applied shall achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) within a reasonable time, not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as may be specified by the Approval Authority.

(5) If a POTW grants conditional removal credits and the POTW or the Approval Authority subsequently makes a final determination, after appropriate notice, that the Industrial User(s) failed to comply with the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the conditional credit shall be terminated by the POTW or the Approval Authority for the non-complying Industrial User(s) and the Industrial User(s) to whom the revised discharge limits had been applied shall achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) within a reasonable time, not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as may be specified by the Approval Authority. The conditional credit shall not be terminated where a violation of the provisions of this paragraph results from causes entirely outside of the control of the Industrial User(s) or the Industrial User(s) had demonstrated substantial compliance.

(6) The Approval Authority may elect not to review an application for conditional removal credit authority upon receipt of such application, in which case the conditionally revised discharge limits will remain in effect until reviewed by the Approval Authority. This review may occur at any time in accordance with the procedures of § 403.11, but in no event later than the time of any pretreatment program approval or any NPDES permit reissuance thereunder.
