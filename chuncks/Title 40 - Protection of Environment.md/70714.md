###### Synthetic seawater formation.

3.2.3To prepare standard seawater, mix technical-grade salts with 900 liters of distilled or demineralized water in the order and quantities listed in table 4. These ingredients must be added in the order listed and each ingredient must be dissolved before another is added. Stir constantly after each addition during preparation until dissolution is complete. Add distilled or demineralized water to make up to 1,000 liters. The pH should now be 8.0+/-0.2. To attain the desired salinity of 20+/-1 ppt, dilute again with distilled or demineralized water at time of use.
