####### First wash.

(a)Cover the entire surface with concentrated or industrial strength detergent or non-ionic surfactant solution. Contain and collect all cleaning solutions for proper disposal. Scrub rough surfaces with a scrub brush or scrubbing pad, adding cleaning solution such that the surface is always very wet, such that each 900 cm(1 square foot) is washed for 1 minute. Wipe smooth surfaces with a cleaning solution-soaked disposable absorbent pad such that each 900 cm(1 square foot) is wiped for 1 minute. Wash any surface <1 square foot for 1 minute. Mop up or absorb the residual cleaner solution and suds with a clean, disposable, absorbent pad until the surface appears dry. This cleaning should remove any residual dirt, dust, grime, or other absorbent materials left on the surface during the first wash.
