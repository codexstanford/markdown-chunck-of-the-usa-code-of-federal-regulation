(1) Immediately cease injection;

(2) Take all steps reasonably necessary to determine whether there may have been a release of the injected carbon dioxide stream or formation fluids into any unauthorized zone;

(3) Notify the Director within 24 hours;

(4) Restore and demonstrate mechanical integrity to the satisfaction of the Director prior to resuming injection; and

(5) Notify the Director when injection can be expected to resume.
