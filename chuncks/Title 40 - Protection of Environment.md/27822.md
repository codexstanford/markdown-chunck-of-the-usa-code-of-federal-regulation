####### Vapor pressure determination.

(b)The composite vapor pressure of hand-wipe cleaning solvents used in a cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall be determined as follows:

(1) For single-component hand-wipe cleaning solvents, the vapor pressure shall be determined using MSDS or other manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods.

(2) The composite vapor pressure of a blended hand-wipe solvent shall be determined by quantifying the amount of each organic compound in the blend using manufacturer's supplied data or a gas chromatographic analysis in accordance with ASTM E 260-91 or 96 (incorporated by reference-see ยง 63.14 of subpart A of this part) and by calculating the composite vapor pressure of the solvent by summing the partial pressures of each component. The vapor pressure of each component shall be determined using manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods. The following equation shall be used to determine the composite vapor pressure:
