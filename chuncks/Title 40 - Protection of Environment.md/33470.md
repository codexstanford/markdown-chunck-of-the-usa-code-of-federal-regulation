() An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)() of this section provided the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and before the otherwise applicable compliance date and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request must include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the problems.

A denial will be effective as of the original compliance date.
