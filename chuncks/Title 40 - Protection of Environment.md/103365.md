####### Adjustable parameter

means any device, system, or element of design that someone can adjust (including those which are difficult to access) and that, if adjusted, may affect emissions or engine performance during emission testing or normal in-use operation. This includes, but is not limited to, parameters related to injection timing and fueling rate. In some cases, this may exclude a parameter that is difficult to access if it cannot be adjusted to affect emissions without significantly degrading engine performance, or if it will not be adjusted in a way that affects emissions during in-use operation.
