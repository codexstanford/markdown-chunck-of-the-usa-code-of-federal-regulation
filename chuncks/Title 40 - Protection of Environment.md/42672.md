####### Time dependency (autocorrelation).

(2)The screening and adjustment for time dependency are conducted according to the following procedures:

(i) Calculate the degree of autocorrelation of the data on their LAG1 values, where the degree of autocorrelation is represented by the Pearson autocorrelation coefficient, ρ, computed from an AR(1) autoregression model, such that:

(ii) The data in a data set will be considered autocorrelated if the autocorrelation coefficient, ρ, is significant at the 5 percent significance level. To determine if this condition is satisfied, calculate Z using the following equation:
