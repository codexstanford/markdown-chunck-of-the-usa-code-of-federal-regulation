####### Correlation.

(i)The correlation must be based on a minimum sample size of five data pairs and a simple linear regression (unless the threshold approach at paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section is used) where the dependent variable (Y-axis) is the quality control test value and the independent variable (X-axis) is the ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 770.99) test value or, upon a showing of equivalence in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 770.99) test value. Either composite wood products or formaldehyde emissions reference materials can be used to establish the correlation.
