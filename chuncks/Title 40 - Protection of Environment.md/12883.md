(153) On July 9, 1999, the State of Illinois submitted a site-specific State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision affecting Volatile Organic Material control requirements at Sun Chemical Corporation (Sun) in Northlake, Illinois. The SIP revision changes requirements for 17 resin storage tanks operated by Sun. Specifically, the SIP revision exempts the 17 tanks from the bottom or submerged fill pipe requirements, provided that no odor nuisance exists at the Sun Northlake facility, and that the vapor pressures of materials stored in the tanks remain less the 0.5 pounds per square inch absolute at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
