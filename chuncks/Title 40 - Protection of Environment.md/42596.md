(D) If a daily calibration error test is failed during a recertification test period (, the results of the test exceed twice the performance specification in section 3 of appendix A to this part), the CEMS is out-of-control as of the hour in which the calibration error test is failed. Emission data from the CEMS shall be invalidated prospectively from the hour of the failed calibration error test until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test following corrective action, at which time the conditionally valid status of data from the monitoring system resumes. Failure to perform a required daily calibration error test during a recertification test period shall also cause data from the CEMS to be invalidated prospectively, from the hour in which the calibration error test was due until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test. Whenever a calibration error test is failed or missed during a recertification test period, no further recertification tests shall be performed until the required subsequent calibration error test has been passed, re-establishing the conditionally valid status of data from the monitoring system. If a calibration error test failure occurs while a linearity check or RATA is still in progress, the linearity check or RATA must be re-started.

(E) Trial gas injections and trial RATA runs are permissible during the recertification test period, prior to commencing a linearity check or RATA, for the purpose of optimizing the performance of the CEMS. The results of such gas injections and trial runs shall not affect the status of previously-recorded conditionally valid data or result in termination of the recertification test period, provided that the following specifications and conditions are met:
