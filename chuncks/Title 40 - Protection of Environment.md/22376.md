###### e.g.,

11.2.2 Initial Extract Concentration. You may perform an initial concentration of the sample extract using the techniques (Kuderna Danish, rotary evaporation, nitrogen blowdown) found to recover the pre-extraction standard sufficient to meet the performance criteria in Section 13.15 of this method. Concentrate initial extracts in toluene using a heating mantle and three-ball Snyder column or a rotary evaporator. Concentrate the field train proof blank and LMB samples in the same manner as samples.

To meet isotopically labeled standard recoveries for low molecular weight PCB and PAH, do not evaporate samples to dryness and do not use a rotary evaporator to concentrate extracts.

11.2.3 Allow the sample extract to cool. You should use a minimum of one half of the sample extract for PCDD/PCDF analysis. You may archive the remaining sample extract or further split the sample extract for PCB and/or PAH analysis and archive.

If using amount other than half the sample extract, adjust the spiking amount of the labeled standards accordingly.
