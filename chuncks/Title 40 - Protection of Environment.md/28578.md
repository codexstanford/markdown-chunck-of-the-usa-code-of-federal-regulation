####### Cover

means a device or system that provides a continuous barrier over the material managed in a surface impoundment to prevent or reduce air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. A cover may have openings needed for operation, inspection, sampling, maintenance, and repair of the surface impoundment provided that each opening is closed when not in use (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports). Examples of a cover for a surface impoundment include, but are not limited to, a floating membrane cover placed on the surface of the material in the surface impoundment or an air-supported structure installed over the surface impoundment.
