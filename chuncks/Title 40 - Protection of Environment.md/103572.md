(vii) Use the cycle weights from paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section and the mode conditions from paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section to generate a set of candidate aging modes by multiplying the cycle weight factor,by 0.25 for the 25th percentile temperature mode, 0.65 for the 50th percentile temperature mode, and by 0.10 for the 90th percentile temperature mode. This will generate a weighted set of mode numbers three times the number of regulatory cycles for the target application. Each mode will have a target temperature and exhaust flow rate.

(viii) If you have only one regulatory cycle for your application, use the cycle modes and weighting factors as they are given in the standard setting part.
