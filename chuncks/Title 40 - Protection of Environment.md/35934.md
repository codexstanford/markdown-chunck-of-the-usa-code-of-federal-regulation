(a) Use equation 1 of this section to calculate the weighted-average organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents used in the past 12 months.

(b) Compliance is based on a 12-month rolling average. If the weighted-average organic HAP content does not exceed 0.33 kilograms of organic HAP per liter of total coating solids, then you are in compliance with the emission limit specified in ยง 63.5743(a)(1).
