###### Graduated payment mortgage loan.

A loan for the purpose of acquiring a single-family dwelling unit involving a plan for repayment in which a portion of the interest due is deferred for a period of time. The interest so deferred is added to the principal balance thus resulting in a principal amount greater than at loan origination (negative amortization). The monthly payments increase on an annual basis (graduate) for a predetermined period of time until the payments reach a level which will fully amortize the loan during the remaining loan term.
