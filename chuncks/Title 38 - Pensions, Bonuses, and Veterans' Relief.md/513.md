##### Patient identifying information.

The term "patient identifying information" means the name, address, social security number, fingerprints, photograph, or similar information by which the identity of a patient can be determined with reasonable accuracy and speed either directly or by reference to other publicly available information. The term does not include a number assigned to a patient by a treatment program, if that number does not consist of, or contain numbers (such as social security, or driver's license number) which could be used to identify a patient with reasonable accuracy and speed from sources external to the treatment program.
