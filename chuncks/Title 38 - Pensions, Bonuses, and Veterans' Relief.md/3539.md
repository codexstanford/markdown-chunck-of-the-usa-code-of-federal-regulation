###### Cost sharing limitations.

(c)To provide financial protection against the impact of a long-term illness or injury, there is a $3,000 calendar year limit or "catastrophic cap" per CHAMPVA eligible family on the CHAMPVA beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs for allowable services and supplies. After a family has paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs, to include both cost-share and deductible amounts, in a calendar year, CHAMPVA will pay the full allowable amounts for the remaining CHAMPVA-covered services and supplies through the end of that calendar year. Credits to the annual catastrophic cap are limited to the applied annual deductible(s) and the CHAMPVA beneficiary cost-share amount. Costs above the CHAMPVA determined allowable amount, as well as costs associated with non-covered medical services and supplies, are not credited toward the catastrophic cap calculation.
