####### Approval of tests.

(b)(1) If an organization or entity wants a licensing or certification test that it offers to be approved for payment of educational assistance, it must apply for approval to the State approving agency having jurisdiction over the locality where the organization or entity has its headquarters. The application must be in the form the State approving agency requires.

(2) In order to be approved for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons, a licensing or certification test must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and the organization or entity offering the test must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and, if appropriate, the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

(i) The State approving agency may approve a licensing or certification test only if-

(A) The test is required under Federal, State, or local law or regulation for an individual to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession; or

(B) The State approving agency decides that the test is generally accepted, in accordance with relevant government, business, or industry standards, employment policies, or hiring practices, as attesting to a level of knowledge or skill required to qualify to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession.

(ii) If a State or political subdivision of a State offers a licensing or certification test, the State approving agency will deem the test to have met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

(3) In considering whether the test is generally accepted, a State approving agency may consider the following:

(i) The nature and number of the entities that recognize the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;

(ii) The degree to which employers in the relevant industry accept the certification test;

(iii) Whether major employers in an industry require that their employees obtain the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;

(iv) The percentage of people employed in the vocation or profession who have taken the test and obtained the certificate; or

(v) Any other reasonable criterion that the State approving agency believes will clarify whether the test is generally accepted.

(4) Generally, if a State approving agency approves a certification test, VA will consider that the test is approved for any veteran or eligible person even if he or she takes the test at a location outside the State where the organization or entity offering the test has its headquarters. However, a certification test approval is valid only in the State where the State approving agency has jurisdiction if-

(i) A State licensing agency recognizes the certification test as meeting a requirement for a license and has sought approval for that test; and

(ii) The State approving agency for the State where the licensing agency is located approves that test.
