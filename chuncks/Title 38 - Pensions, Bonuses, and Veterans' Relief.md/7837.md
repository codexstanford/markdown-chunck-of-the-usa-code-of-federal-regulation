(9)v.All known debts and obligations including any alimony and/or child support payments of the borrower and spouse must be documented. Significant liabilities, to be deducted from the total income in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments are accounts that, generally, are of a relatively long term,, 10 months or over. Other accounts for terms of less than 10 months must, of course, be considered in determining ability to meet family expenses. Certainly, any severe impact on the family's resources for any period of time must be considered in the loan analysis. For example, monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan with a remaining balance of $1,500 would be included in those obligations to be deducted from the total income regardless of the fact that the account can be expected to pay out in 5 months. It is clear that the applicant will, in this case, continue to carry the burden of those $300 payments for the first, most critical months of the home loan.
