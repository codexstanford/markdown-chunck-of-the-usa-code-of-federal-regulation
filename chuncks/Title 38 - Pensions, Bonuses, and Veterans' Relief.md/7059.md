###### ยง 21.7672 Measurement of courses not leading to a standard college degree.
####### Overview.

(a)(1) Courses not leading to a standard college degree may be measured on either a clock-hour basis, or a credit-hour basis or a combination of both. Factors which the Department of Veterans Affairs must include in determining the proper basis for measurement include whether the courses are accredited; whether the course could be credited toward a standard college degree; and whether the course is offered on a standard quarter or semester-hour basis.

(2) In determining which is the correct basis for measuring a reservist's enrollment, VA will first examine whether credit-hour measurement is appropriate, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(3) If it is not appropriate to measure a reservist's enrollment on a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the enrollment on a clock-hour basis as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
