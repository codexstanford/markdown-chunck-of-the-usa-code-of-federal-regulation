####### Rights of children.

(3)Where primary title is vested in the surviving spouse, the claimant's election controls the rights of any of the veteran's children, regardless of whether they are in the claimant's custody and regardless of the fact that such children may not be eligible to receive benefits under laws administered by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. A child who is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation or other benefits independent of the surviving spouse's entitlement may receive such benefits concurrently with payment of FECA benefits to the surviving spouse.
