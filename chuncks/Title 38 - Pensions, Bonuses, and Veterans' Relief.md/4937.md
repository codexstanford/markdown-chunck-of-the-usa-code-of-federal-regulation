####### Selection of courses.

(b)VA will generally select courses of study and training, completion of which usually results in a diploma, certificate, degree, qualification for licensure, or employment. If such courses are not available in the area in which the veteran resides, or if they are available but not accessible to the veteran, other arrangements may be made. Such arrangements may include, but are not limited to:

(1) Relocation of the veteran to another area in which necessary services are available, or

(2) Use of an individual instructor to provide necessary training.
