(a)Ordinarily, special restorative training may not exceed 12 months. When the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor, after consulting with the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel, determines that more than 12 months of training is necessary, he or she will refer the program to the Executive Director, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Service for prior approval. Where the plan for a program of special restorative training itself (not in combination with the program of education) will require more than 45 months (or its equivalent in accelerated payments) the plan will be included in the recommendation to the Executive Director, VR&E Service for approval.
