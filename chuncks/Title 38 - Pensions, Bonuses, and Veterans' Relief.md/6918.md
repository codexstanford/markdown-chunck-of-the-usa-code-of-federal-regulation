####### Vocational or professional objective.

(28)A vocational or professional objective is one that leads to an occupation. It may include educational objectives essential to prepare for the chosen occupation, but not include any educational objectives beyond the bachelor's degree. When a program of education consists of series of courses not leading to an educational objective, these courses must be pursued at an institution of higher learning and must be required for attainment of a designated vocational or professional objective.
