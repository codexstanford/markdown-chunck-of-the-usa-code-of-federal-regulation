##### ยง 17.56 VA payment for inpatient and outpatient health care professional services at non-departmental facilities and other medical charges associated with non-VA outpatient care.

(a) Except for health care professional services provided in the state of Alaska (see paragraph (b) of this section), VA will determine the amounts paid under ยง 17.52 or ยง 17.120 for health care professional services, and all other medical services associated with non-VA outpatient care, using the applicable method in this section:

(1) If a specific amount has been negotiated with a specific provider, VA will pay that amount.

(2) If an amount has not been negotiated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, VA will pay the lowest of the following amounts:

(i) The applicable Medicare fee schedule or prospective payment system amount ("Medicare rate") for the period in which the service was provided (without any changes based on the subsequent development of information under Medicare authorities), subject to the following:

(A) In the event of a Medicare waiver, the payment amount will be calculated in accordance with such waiver.

(B) In the absence of a Medicare rate or Medicare waiver, payment will be the VA Fee Schedule amount for the period in which the service was provided. The VA Fee Schedule amount is determined by the authorizing VA medical facility, which ranks all billings (if the facility has had at least eight billings) from non-VA facilities under the corresponding procedure code during the previous fiscal year, with billings ranked from the highest to the lowest. The VA Fee Schedule amount is the charge falling at the 75th percentile. If the authorizing facility has not had at least eight such billings, then this paragraph does not apply.
