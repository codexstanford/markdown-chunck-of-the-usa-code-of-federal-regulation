####### Conversion of credit hours to clock hours.

(c)If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by-

(1) Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and

(2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
