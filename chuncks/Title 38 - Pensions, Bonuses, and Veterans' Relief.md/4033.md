###### Adaptive household item

means a durable household item that has been adapted to compensate for, or that by design compensates for, loss of physical, sensory, or cognitive function and is necessary to complete one or more ADLs in the home or other residential setting. Adaptive household items include but are not limited to adaptive eating utensils, shower stools or chairs, hooks to assist in buttoning clothing, or shoe horns. This definition does not include household furniture or furnishings, improvements or structural alterations, or household appliances, unless a household appliance is necessary to complete an ADL in the home or other residential setting. VA will not furnish such items or services in such a manner as to relieve any other person or entity of a contractual obligation to furnish these items or services to the veteran.
