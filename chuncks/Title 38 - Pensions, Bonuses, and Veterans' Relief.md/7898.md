(i)(1) The holder shall make an inspection of the property securing the loan whenever it becomes aware that the physical condition of the security may be in jeopardy. Unless a repayment agreement is in effect, a property inspection shall also be made at the following times:

(i) Before the 60th day of delinquency or before initiating action to liquidate a loan, whichever is earlier; and

(ii) At least once each month after liquidation proceedings have been started unless servicing information shows the property remains owner-occupied.

(2) Whenever a holder obtains information which indicates that the property securing the loan is abandoned, it shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the property from vandalism and the elements. Thereafter, the holder shall schedule inspections at least monthly to prevent unnecessary deterioration due to vandalism, or neglect. With respect to any loan more than 60 calendar days delinquent, if the property is abandoned, this fact must be reported to the Secretary as required in ยง 36.4317(c)(10) and immediate action should be initiated by the servicer to terminate the loan once the abandonment has been confirmed.
