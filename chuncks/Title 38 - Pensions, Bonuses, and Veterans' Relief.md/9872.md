(i) CATEX-does not require documentation unless the Master Planner determines that an extraordinary circumstance may exist, whereupon a CATEX-requires documentation must be prepared (below). The likelihood of such a circumstance is judged to be so low that no specific environmental document is typically required.

(ii) CATEX-requires documentation that involves a cursory review to ensure that no extraordinary circumstances exist. For an action falling into such a category, a CATEX requiring documentation is completed to support a determination by the Master Planner, as to whether the action needs further review under NEPA. A CATEX documentation is developed and maintained by the Master Planner.

(3) CATEXs requiring and not requiring documentation are listed in appendix A of these regulations.
