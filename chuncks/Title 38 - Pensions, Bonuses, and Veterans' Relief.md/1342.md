(c)(1) A determination is required as to whether a veteran was discharged or released from active duty service because of a service-connected disability (or whether the official service department records show that the veteran had at time of separation from service a service-connected disability which in medical judgment would have warranted discharge for disability) whenever any of the following circumstances exist:

(i) The veteran applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32, the minimum active duty service requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5303A apply to him or her, and the veteran would be eligible for such benefits only if-

(A) He or she was discharged or released from active duty for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty, or

(B) He or she has a disability that VA has determined to be compensable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 11; or

(ii) The veteran applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 and-

(A) The evidence of record does not clearly show either that the veteran was discharged or released from active duty for disability or that the veteran's discharge or release from active duty was unrelated to disability, and

(B) The veteran is eligible for basic educational assistance except for the minimum length of active duty service requirements of § 21.7042(a) or § 21.7044(a) of this chapter.

(2) A determination is required as to whether a veteran was discharged or released from service in the Selected Reserve for a service-connected disability or for a medical condition which preexisted the veteran's having become a member of the Selected Reserve and which VA determines is not service connected when the veteran applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 and-

(i) Either the veteran would be eligible for basic educational assistance under that chapter only if he or she was discharged from the Selected Reserve for a service-connected disability, or for a medical condition which preexisted the veteran's having become a member of the Selected Reserve and which VA finds is not service connected, or

(ii) The veteran is entitled to basic educational assistance and would be entitled to receive it at the rates stated in § 21.7136(a) or § 21.7137(a) of this chapter only if he or she was discharged from the Selected Reserve for a service-connected disability or for a medical condition which preexisted the veteran's having become a member of the Selected Reserve and which VA finds is not service connected.

(3) A determination is required as to whether a reservist has been unable to pursue a program of education due to a disability which has been incurred in or aggravated by service in the Selected Reserve when-

(i) The reservist is otherwise entitled to educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, and

(ii) He or she applies for an extension of his or her eligibility period.

(4) The determinations required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section are subject to the presumptions of incurrence under § 3.304(b) and aggravation under § 3.306 (a) and (c) of this part, based on service rendered after May 7, 1975.
