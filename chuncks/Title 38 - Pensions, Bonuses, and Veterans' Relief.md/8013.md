(4)All amenities of the condominium (to include offsite community facilities), that are to be considered in the unit value, must be bound legally to the condominium regime. All such amenities as well as the common elements of the project, must be substantially completed and available for use by the unit owners. In large multi-phase projects, the declarant should construct common elements in a manner consistent with the addition of units to support the entire development. The Secretary, in appropriate cases, may approve the placement of adequate funds by the declarant in an escrow or otherwise earmarked account or accept a letter of credit or surety bond to assure completion of amenities and allow closing of VA-guaranteed (or insured) loans. Such funds must be adequate to assure completion of the amenities free and clear of all liens.
