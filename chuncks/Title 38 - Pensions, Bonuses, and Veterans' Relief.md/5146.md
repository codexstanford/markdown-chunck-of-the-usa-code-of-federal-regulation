####### Requirements for payments to employers.

(b)Payments may be made to employers to provide on-job training or to begin and maintain employment if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The veteran is in need of an on-job training situation or is generally qualified for employment but such on-job situation or employment opportunity is not otherwise available despite repeated and intensive efforts on the part of VA and the veteran to secure such opportunities. These conditions are also considered to be met when:

(i) There are few employers within commuting distance of the veteran's home who can provide a training or employment opportunity consistent with the veteran's plan; and

(ii) The veteran reasonably could not be required to seek on-job or employment opportunities in other areas due to the effects of his or her disability, family situation, or other pertinent factors; and

(iii) The available local employers will only provide a training or employment opportunity if VA agrees to reimburse for direct expenses to the degree permitted under this section.

(2) The training establishment or employer is in compliance with provisions of ยง 21.292 (a) and (b), pertaining to the approval of courses and facilities.

(3) VA entered into an agreement with the employer in writing prior to the beginning of the period of on-job training or employment, whereby the employer will be reimbursed for direct expenses approved under provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

(4) The on-job training program or employment of the veteran does not displace a current employee or prevent the recall of a laid-off employee.
