####### Institution of higher learning.

(b)(1) VA may hold an institution of higher learning liable for overpayments that result from the institution of higher learning's willful or negligent failure to report excessive absences from a course, discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by an individual or from willful or negligent false certification by the institution of higher learning. See § 21.9695(b).

(2) If an institution of higher learning willfully and knowingly submits a false report or certification, VA may disapprove that institution of higher learning's programs of education for further enrollments and may discontinue educational assistance to eligible individuals already enrolled. In doing so, VA will apply §§ 21.4210 through 21.4216.
