### PART 0 - VALUES, STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, AND RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES
#### Subpart A - Core Values, Characteristics, and Customer Experience Principles of the Department
##### ยง 0.605 Ethical framework principles for access to and use of veteran data.
###### Principle 4. Access to and exchange of veteran data should be transparent and consistent.

(4)Access to and the exchange of veteran data should be transparent and consistent, and in accordance with all applicable standards. For the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), this includes practices described in VHA's Notice of Privacy Practices. Data should only be shared or accessed for approved and specified purposes; there should be no unspecified use, or re-use of veteran data without VA agreement or approval. The release of veteran data for purposes other than those which were originally approved or specified, such as in an agreement, requires a separate approval and commitment of all parties to follow these principles. Failure to ensure such protections is a breach of veteran trust and confidentiality.
