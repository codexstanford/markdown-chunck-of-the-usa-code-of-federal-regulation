(a) If the holder acquires the property that secured the guaranteed loan at the liquidation sale or through acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and if, under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the Secretary may accept conveyance of the property, the holder must notify the Secretary by electronic means no later than 15 calendar days after the date of liquidation sale (, the event which fixes the rights of the parties in the property, such as the date of foreclosure sale, date of recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or confirmation/ratification of sale date when required under local practice) that the holder elects to convey the property to the Secretary. The Secretary will not accept conveyance of the property if the holder fails to notify the Secretary of its election within such 15 calendar days. In computing the eligible indebtedness under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the holder may follow the alternative procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section.
