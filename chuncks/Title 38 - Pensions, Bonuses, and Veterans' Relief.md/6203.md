###### ยง 21.5072 Entitlement charge.
####### Correspondence training courses.

(c)(1) A charge against the period of entitlement for a program consisting exclusively of correspondence training will be made on the basis of 1 month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under ยง 21.5138(a)(2)(viii), which is paid to the individual as an educational assistance allowance for this training. When computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.

(2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at by applying the formula is determined to be $150 at the time a benefit program for correspondence training is computed, the individual will be charged 1 month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.
