(2) Only after all candidates in the area described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section either have been given work-study contracts or have withdrawn their request for contracts will VA offer contracts to those who are not pursuing a program of education or rehabilitation and who wish to reduce their indebtedness through performance of work-study services.

(3) VA shall not offer a contract to an individual who is receiving compensation from another source for the work-study services the individual wishes to perform.

(4) VA shall not offer a contract to an individual if VA determines that the debt can be collected through other means such as collection in a lump sum, collection in installments as provided in ยง 1.917 or compromise as provided in ยง 1.918.
