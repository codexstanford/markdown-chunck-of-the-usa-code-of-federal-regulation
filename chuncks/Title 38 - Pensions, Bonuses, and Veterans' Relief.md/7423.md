(b)If the courses are measured in clock hours, VA will-

(1) Convert the clock hours to equivalent credit hours by-

(i) Adding the total number of clock hours pursued during the term, quarter or semester;

(ii) Dividing the sum of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by the total number of weeks in the term; and

(iii) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section rounded to the nearest hundredth by-

(A) If the institution of higher learning measures courses using both credit and clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing the number of credit hours considered full-time at the institution by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.

(B) If the institution of higher learning only measures courses using clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing 14 credit hours by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.

(2) Divide the result of paragraph (b)(1) rounded to the nearest hundredth by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.

(c) Fourteen credit hours are full-time unless the institution of higher learning certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for 13 credit hours, or for 12 credit hours, are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes.
