###### Default.

(d)Whenever VA determines that a default, in whole or in part, has occurred on any such loan the eligible spouse or surviving spouse shall be notified that the amount of the default shall be recovered from the eligible spouse or surviving spouse concerned in the same manner as other debt due the United States. Once a default has occurred, the eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's subsequent reentrance into training at the half-time or greater rate shall not be the basis for rescinding the default. A default may only be rescinded when VA has been led to create the default as a result of a mistake of fact or law.
