##### limb salvage

(xix) The termmeans a series of operations designed to save an arm or leg with all of its associated parts rather than amputate it. For purposes of this section, a surgeon must certify that the option of amputation of the limb(s) was a medically justified alternative to salvage, and the patient chose to pursue salvage.
