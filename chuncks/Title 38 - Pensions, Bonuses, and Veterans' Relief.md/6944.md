####### Interruption to conserve entitlement.

(d)A reservist may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester if the reservist is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the reservist is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:

(1) Enrollment is terminated;

(2) The reservist cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

(3) The reservist interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester; and

(4) The reservist requests interruption or cancellation for any break when an institution of higher learning was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. In such a case entitlement will be restored unless the reservist negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period and does not repay the amount received.
