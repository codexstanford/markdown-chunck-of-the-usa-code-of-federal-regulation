##### § 1.970 Standards for compromise.

Decisions of the Committee respecting acceptance or rejection of a compromise offer shall be in conformity with the standards in §§ 1.930 through 1.936. In loan guaranty cases the offer of a veteran or other obligor to effect a compromise must relate to an indebtedness established after the liquidation of the security, if any, and shall be reviewed by the Committee. An offer to effect a compromise may be accepted if it is deemed advantageous to the Government. A decision on an offer of compromise may be revised or modified on the basis of any information which would warrant a change in the original decision.
