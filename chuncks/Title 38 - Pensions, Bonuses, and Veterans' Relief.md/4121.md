###### Criteria for using.

(a)VA may furnish hospital care, medical services, or extended care services through a Veterans Care Agreement only if:

(1) Such care or services are furnished to a covered individual who is eligible for such care or services under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 and requires such care or services; and

(2) Such care or services are not feasibly available to that covered individual through a VA facility, contract, or sharing agreement. For purposes of this subparagraph, hospital care, medical services, or extended care services are not feasibly available through a VA facility, contract, or sharing agreement when VA determines that the medical condition of the covered individual, the travel involved, the nature of the care or services, or a combination of these factors make the use of a VA facility, contract, or sharing agreement impracticable or inadvisable.
