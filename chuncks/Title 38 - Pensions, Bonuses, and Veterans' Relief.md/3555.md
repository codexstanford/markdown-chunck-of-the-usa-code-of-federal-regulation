###### Ambulatory surgery.

(l)The CHAMPVA reimbursement methodology for facility charges associated with procedures performed in a freestanding ambulatory surgery center is based on a prospectively determined amount, similar to that used by TRICARE. These facility charges do not include physician fees, anesthesiologist fees, or fees of other authorized non-VA providers; such independent professional fees must be submitted separately from facility fees and are calculated under the methodology in paragraph (e) of this section.
