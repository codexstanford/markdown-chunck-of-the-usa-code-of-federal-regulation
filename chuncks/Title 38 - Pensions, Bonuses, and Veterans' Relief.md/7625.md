(b) A lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat charge not exceeding one (1) percent of the amount of the loan less the portion thereof allocated to the manufactured home:That such flat charge shall be in lieu of all other charges relating to costs of origination not expressly specified and allowed in this schedule.

(c) Except for a refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) or (G) fees and charges specified in this section may not be included in the loan.

(d)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary. A fee of 1 percent of the total loan amount must be paid to the Secretary before a combination manufactured home and lot loan (or a loan to purchase a lot upon which a manufactured home owned by the veteran will be placed) will be eligible for guaranty. Provided, however, that the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F). All or part of such fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

(2) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which section 3714 of chapter 37 of 38 U.S.C. applies. The instrument securing such a loan shall contain a provision describing the right of the holder to collect this fee as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The loan holder shall list the amount of this fee in every assumption statement provided and include a notice that the fee must be paid to the holder immediately following loan settlement. The fee must be transmitted to the Secretary within 15 days of receipt by the holder of notice of the transfer.

Any lender closing a loan, subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, who fails to submit timely payment of this fee will be subject to a late charge equal to 4 percent of the total fee due. If payment of the 1 percent fee is made more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.

(4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them.
