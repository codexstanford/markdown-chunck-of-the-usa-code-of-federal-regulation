####### Courses not leading to a standard college degree.

(1)(i) Except as provided in this paragraph VA requires that a certification of attendance be submitted monthly for each veteran or eligible person enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree.

Unless exempted by this paragraph this requirement also applies to courses measured on a credit-hour basis. This requirement does not apply to-

(A) Courses measured on a credit-hour basis pursuant to footnote 6 of ยง 21.4270(a),

(B) A course pursued on a less than one-half-time basis,

(C) A course pursued by a serviceperson while on active duty, or

(D) A correspondence course which must meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
