####### Credit hour measurement: Undergraduate, nonstandard term.

(b)(1) If an individual enrolls in a nonstandard term, quarter or semester, and the school measures the course on a credit-hour basis, VA will determine whether that individual is a full-time student by-

(i) Multiplying the credits earned in the term by 18 if credit is granted in semester hours, or by 12 if credit is granted in quarter hours, and

(ii) Dividing the product by the number of whole weeks in the term.

(2) In determining whole weeks VA will-

(i) Divide the number of days in the term by 7;

(ii) Disregard a remainder of 3 days or less, and

(iii) Consider 4 days or more to be a whole week.

(3) If the number obtained by using the formula in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section is 12 or more, the individual is a full-time student. If that number is less than 12, the individual is a part-time student.
