##### § 17.93 Eligibility for outpatient services.
###### For adjunct treatment.

(2)Subject to the provisions of §§ 17.36 through 17.38, medical services on an ambulatory or outpatient basis shall be provided to veteans for an adjunct nonservice-connected condition associated with and held to be aggravating a disability from a disease or injury adjudicated as being service-connected.

(b) The term "shall furnish" in this section and 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1) and (a)(2) means that, if the veteran is in immediate need of outpatient medical services, VA shall furnish care at the VA facility where the veteran applies. If the needed medical services are not available there, VA shall arrange for care at the nearest VA medical facility or Department of Defense facility (with which VA has a sharing agreement) that can provide the needed care. If VA and Department of Defense facilities are not available, VA shall arrange for care on a fee basis, but only if the veteran is eligible to receive medical services in non-VA facilities under § 17.52.

(c) VA may furnish on an ambulatory or outpatient basis medical services as needed to the following applicants, except that applications for dental treatment must also meet the provisions of § 17.123.
