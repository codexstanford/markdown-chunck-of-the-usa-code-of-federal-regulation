(5)An applicant for a Federally-assisted loan will not be considered a satisfactory credit risk for such loan if the applicant is presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government, e.g., a Small Business Administration loan, a U.S. Guaranteed Student loan, a debt to the Public Health Service, or where there is a judgment lien against the applicant's property for a debt owed to the Government. The applicant may not be approved for the loan until the delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency owed, or the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied. Of course, the applicant must also be able to otherwise qualify for the loan from an income and remaining credit standpoint. Refinancing under VA's interest rate reduction refinancing provisions, however, is allowed even if the borrower is delinquent on the VA guaranteed mortgage being refinanced. Prior approval processing is required in such cases.
