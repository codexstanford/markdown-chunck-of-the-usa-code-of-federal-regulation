## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 21 - VETERAN READINESS AND EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION
#### Subpart G - Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32
##### Eligibility
###### ยง 21.5042 Extended period of eligibility.
####### Qualifying period of disability.

(c)(1) A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the period of time that the veteran himself or herself was prevented by reason of physical or mental disability, not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct, from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education.

(2) VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct provided the last date of the time limit for filing a claim for the extension determined under ยง 21.5030(c)(3) of this part occurs after November 17, 1988.

(3) Evidence must be presented which clearly establishes that the veteran's disability made pursuit of his or her program medically infeasible during the veteran's original period of eligibility as determined by ยง 21.5041 of this part. A period of disability following the end of the original disability period will not be a basis for extension.

(4) VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.
