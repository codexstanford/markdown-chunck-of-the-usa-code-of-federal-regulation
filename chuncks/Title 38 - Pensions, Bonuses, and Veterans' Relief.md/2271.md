###### What happens if a policyholder enrolled in VALife dies, surrenders or cancels coverage during the two-year enrollment period?

(e)If a policyholder enrolls in VALife for an amount less than the statutory maximum and elects to apply for additional coverage at a later date and dies before completing the two-year waiting period for the additional VALife coverage amount, the beneficiary shall be refunded premiums that were paid for the additional VALife coverage, plus interest, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1922B(c)(3)(A). If a policyholder surrenders or cancels a VALife policy during the two-year waiting period imposed by 38 U.S.C. 1922B(c)(2) before coverage is in force, the United States shall not return to the policyholder the premiums that were paid to purchase the coverage.
