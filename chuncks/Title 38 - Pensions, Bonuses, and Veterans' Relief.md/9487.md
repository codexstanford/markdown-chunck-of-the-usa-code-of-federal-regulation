##### i.e.,

(e)(1) If the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(b) or (c) (is a legacy participant or a legacy applicant), the eligible veteran and Family Caregiver will be reassessed by VA (in collaboration with the primary care team to the maximum extent practicable) within the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020 to determine whether the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(a). This reassessment may include a visit to the eligible veteran's home. If the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(a), the reassessment will consider whether the eligible veteran is unable to self-sustain in the community for purposes of the monthly stipend rate under § 71.40(c)(4)(i)(A).

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a reassessment will not be completed under paragraph (e)(1) if at some point before a reassessment is completed during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020 the individual no longer meets the requirements of § 71.20(b) or (c).
