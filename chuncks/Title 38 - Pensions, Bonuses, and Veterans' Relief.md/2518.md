(b)Fiduciary matters arise after VA has determined that a beneficiary is entitled to benefits, and decisions on fiduciary matters are not decisions on claims for VA monetary benefits. Accordingly, VA's regulations governing the adjudication of claims for benefits,38 CFR part 3, do not apply to fiduciary matters unless VA has prescribed applicability in this part.
