(2) There will be a charge (for record purposes only) against the remaining entitlement, under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34, of an individual who is receiving the educational assistance under ยง 21.7137 of this part. The record-purpose charges against entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 will not count against the 48 months of total entitlement under both 38 U.S.C. chapters 30 and 34 to which the veteran or servicemember may be entitled. (ยง 21.4020(a) of this part).

(3) Generally, VA will base those entitlement charges on the principle that a veteran or servicemember who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement. However, this general principle does not apply to a veteran or servicemember who:

(i) Is pursuing correspondence training;

(ii) Is pursuing flight training;

(iii) Is pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training;

(iv) Is paid an accelerated payment;

(v) Is receiving educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test; or

(vi) Is receiving tuition assistance top-up.

(4) The provisions of this section apply to:

(i) Veterans and servicemembers training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30; and

(ii) Veterans training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 who make a valid election under ยง 21.21 of this part to receive educational assistance equivalent to that paid to veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30.
