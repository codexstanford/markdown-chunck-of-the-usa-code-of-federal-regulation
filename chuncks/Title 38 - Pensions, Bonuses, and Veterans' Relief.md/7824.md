(iii)If income from rental property will be used to qualify for the new loan, the documentation required of a self-employed applicant should be obtained together with evidence of cash reserves equaling 3 months PITI on the rental property. As for any self-employed earnings (see paragraph (f)(7) of this section), depreciation claimed may be added back in as income. In the case of a veteran who has no experience as a landlord, it is unlikely that the income from a rental property may be used to qualify for the new loan.
