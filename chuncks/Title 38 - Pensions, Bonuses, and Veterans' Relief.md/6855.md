####### Nonpunitive grades.

(c)(1) An educational institution may assign a nonpunitive grade for a course or subject in which the veteran or servicemember is enrolled even though the veteran or eligible person does not withdraw from the course or subject. When this occurs, the educational institution must report the assignment of the nonpunitive grade in a form prescribed by the Secretary in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

(i) Thirty days from the date on which the educational institution assigns the grade, or

(ii) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period for which the nonpunitive grade is assigned.

(2) If the veteran or servicemember is enrolled in a course which does not lead to a standard college degree and for which a monthly certification of attendance is required, the educational institution may use the monthly certification of attendance to report nonpunitive grades provided VA will receive the report within the time period stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
