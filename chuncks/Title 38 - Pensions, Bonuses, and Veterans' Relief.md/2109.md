## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 3 - ADJUDICATION
#### Subpart D - Universal Adjudication Rules That Apply to Benefit Claims Governed by Part 3 of This Title
##### Revisions
###### ยง 3.2601 Higher-level review.
####### Difference of opinion.

(j)The higher-level adjudicator may grant a benefit sought in the claim under review based on a difference of opinion (see ยง 3.105(b)). However, any finding favorable to the claimant is binding except as provided in ยง 3.104(c) of this part. In addition, the higher-level adjudicator will not revise the outcome in a manner that is less advantageous to the claimant based solely on a difference of opinion. The higher-level adjudicator may reverse or revise (even if disadvantageous to the claimant) prior decisions by VA (including the decision being reviewed or any prior decision) on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error under ยง 3.105(a)(1) or (a)(2), as applicable, depending on whether the prior decision is finally adjudicated.
