####### i.e.

(ii) VA furnished the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination without the veteran's or, in appropriate cases, the veteran's representative's informed consent. To determine whether there was informed consent, VA will consider whether the health care providers substantially complied with the requirements of ยง 17.32 of this chapter. Minor deviations from the requirements of ยง 17.32 of this chapter that are immaterial under the circumstances of a case will not defeat a finding of informed consent. Consent may be express (, given orally or in writing) or implied under the circumstances specified in ยง 17.32(b) of this chapter, as in emergency situations.
