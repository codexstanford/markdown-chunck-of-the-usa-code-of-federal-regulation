(ii) A three-quarter-time enrollment is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction per week or three units per year or the equivalent;

(iii) A one-half-time enrollment is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction per week or two units per year or the equivalent;

(iv) A less than one-half-time but more than one-quarter-time enrollment is 5 through 8 clock hours net instruction per week or one unit per year or the equivalent; and

(v) A one-quarter-time enrollment is 1 through 4 clock hours net instruction per week.
