###### ยง 21.7673 Measurement of concurrent enrollments.
####### Conversion of units of measurement required.

(a)Where a reservist enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, the Department of Veterans Affairs will measure the reservist's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the reservist is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:

(1) If VA measures the course at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis as provided in ยง 21.7672(b)), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.

(2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, including courses which qualify for credit-hour measurement on the basis of ยง 21.7672(b), VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the reservist's training time.
