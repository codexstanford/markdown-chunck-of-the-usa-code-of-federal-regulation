####### General.

(a)A combination course is a course which combines training on the job with training in school. For the purpose of VA vocational rehabilitation, a course will be considered to be a combination course, if the student spends full-time on the job and one or more times a week also attends school on a part-time basis. A veteran may pursue the components of a combination course in the following manner:

(1) Concurrent school and on-job training;

(2) Primarily on-job with some related instruction in school;

(3) In a school as a preparatory course to entering on-job training; or

(4) First training on-job followed by the school portion.
