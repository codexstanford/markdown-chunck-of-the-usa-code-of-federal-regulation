## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 63 - HEALTH CARE FOR HOMELESS VETERANS (HCHV) PROGRAM
#### ยง 63.15 Duties of, and standards applicable to, non-VA community-based providers.
##### Treatment plans, therapeutic/rehabilitative services, and case management.

(b)Individualized treatment plans are to be developed through a joint effort of the veteran, non-VA community-based provider staff, and VA clinical staff. Therapeutic and rehabilitative services, as well as case management and outreach services, must be provided by the non-VA community-based provider as described in the treatment plan. In some cases, VA may complement the non-VA community-based provider's program with added treatment or other services, such as participation in VA outpatient programs or counseling. In addition to case management services, for example, to coordinate or address relevant issues related to a veteran's homelessness and health as identified in the individual treatment plan, services provided by the non-VA community-based provider should generally include, as appropriate:

(1) Structured group activities such as group therapy, social skills training, self-help group meetings, or peer counseling.

(2) Professional counseling, including counseling on self-care skills, adaptive coping skills, and, as appropriate, vocational rehabilitation counseling, in collaboration with VA programs and community resources.
