####### Educational institution or training establishment.

(b)(1) VA may hold an educational institution or training establishment liable for overpayments which result from the educational institution's or training establishment's willful or negligent failure to report excessive absences from a course or discontinuance or interruption of a course by a veteran or servicemember or from willful or negligent false certification by the educational institution or training establishment. See § 21.7144(b).

(2) If an educational institution or training establishment willfully and knowingly submits a false report or certification, VA may disapprove that institution's or establishment's courses for further enrollments and may discontinue educational assistance to veterans and servicemembers already enrolled. In doing so, VA will apply §§ 21.4210 through 21.4216.
