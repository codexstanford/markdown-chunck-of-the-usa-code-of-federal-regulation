(f)(1) For any month in which an eligible veteran pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training program fails to complete 120 hours of training, VA will reduce proportionally-

(i) The rates specified in §§ 21.7136(b)(2), (c)(2), (d)(4) through (d)(6), (f)(4), and (h)(2) and 21.7137(a)(2); and

(ii) Any increase ("kicker") set by the Secretary of the service department concerned as described in §§ 21.7136(g) and 21.7137(d).

(2) In making the computations required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, VA will round the number of hours worked to the nearest multiple of eight.

(3) For the purpose of this paragraph "hours worked" include only-

(i) The training hours the veteran worked, and

(ii) All hours of the veteran's related training which occurred during the standard workweek and for which the veteran received wages. (See § 21.4270(c), footnote 5, as to the requirements for full-time training.)
