####### Full-time training.

(c)An eligible person will pursue special restorative training on a full-time basis.

(1) Full-time training requires training for:

(i) That amount of time per week which commonly is required for a full-time course at the educational institution when, based on medical findings, the Department of Veterans Affairs determines that the eligible person's physical or mental condition permits training for that amount of time, or

(ii) The maximum time per week permitted by the eligible person's disability, as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs, based on medical findings, if the disability precludes the weekly training time stated in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) If the hours per week that can reasonably be devoted to restorative training will not of themselves equal the time required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the course will be supplemented with subject matter which will contribute toward the objective of the program of education.
