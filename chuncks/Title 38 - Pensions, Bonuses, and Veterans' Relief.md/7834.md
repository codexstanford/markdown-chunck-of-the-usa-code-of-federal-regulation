###### Absence of credit history.

(6)The fact that recently discharged veterans may have had no opportunity to develop a credit history will not preclude a determination of satisfactory credit. Similarly, other loan applicants may not have established credit histories as a result of a preference for purchasing consumer items with cash rather than credit. There are also cases in which individuals may be genuinely wary of acquiring new obligations following bankruptcy, consumer credit counseling (debt proration), or other disruptive credit occurrence. The absence of the credit history in these cases will not generally be viewed as an adverse factor in credit underwriting. However, before a favorable decision is made for cases involving bankruptcies or other derogatory credit factors, efforts should be made to develop evidence of timely payment of non-installment debts such as rent and utilities. It is anticipated that this special consideration in the absence of a credit history following bankruptcy would be the rare case and generally confined to bankruptcies that occurred over 3 years ago.
