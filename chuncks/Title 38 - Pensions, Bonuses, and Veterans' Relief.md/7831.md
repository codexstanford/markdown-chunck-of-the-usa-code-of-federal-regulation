###### Petition under Chapter 13 of Bankruptcy Code.

(3)A petition under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.) filed by the borrower or spouse is indicative of an effort to pay their creditors. Some plans may provide for full payment of debts while others arrange for payment of scaled-down debts. Regular payments are made to a court-appointed trustee over a 2- to 3-year period (or up to 5 years in some cases). When the borrowers have made all payments in a satisfactory manner, they may be considered as having reestablished satisfactory credit. When they apply for a home loan before completion of the payout period, favorable consideration may nevertheless be given if at least 12 months' worth of payments have been made satisfactorily and the Trustee or Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit.
