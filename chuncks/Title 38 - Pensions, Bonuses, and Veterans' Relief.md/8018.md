###### Proposed construction or existing declarant in control.

(1)Bona fide agreements of sale must have been executed by purchasers other than the declarant (who are obligated contractually to complete the purchase) of 70 percent of the total number of units in the project. Lenders shall certify as to satisfaction of the presale requirement prior to VA guaranty of the first unit loan. When a declarant can demonstrate that a lower percentage would be justified, the Secretary, on an individual case basis, may approve a presale requirement of less than 70 percent. Reduction of the 70 percent presale requirement will be considered when:

(i) Strong initial sales demonstrate a ready market, or

(ii) The declarant will provide cash assets or acceptable bonds for payment of full common area assessments to the owners' association until such assessments are assumed by unit purchasers, or

(iii) Subsequent phases of an overall development are being undertaken in a proven market area, or

(iv) Previous experience in similar projects in the same market area indicates strong market acceptance, or

(v) The development is in a market area that has repeatedly indicated acceptance of such projects.
