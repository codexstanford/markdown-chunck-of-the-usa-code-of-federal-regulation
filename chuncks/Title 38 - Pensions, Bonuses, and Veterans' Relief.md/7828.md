(g)The conclusion reached as to whether or not the veteran and spouse are satisfactory credit risks must also be based on a careful analysis of the available credit data. Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires that lenders, in evaluating creditworthiness, shall consider, on the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse which the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness. In other than community property states, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B prohibits any request for or consideration of information about the spouse concerning income, employment, assets or liabilities. In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant.
