####### Withdrawals and nonpunitive grades.

(a)(1) Withdrawal from a course or receipt of a nonpunitive grade affects payments to a reservist. VA will not pay benefits to a reservist for pursuit of a course from which the reservist withdraws or receives a nonpunitive grade which is not used in computing requirements for graduation unless the provisions of this paragraph are met.

(i) The reservist withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or

(ii) Both of the following exist.

(A) There are mitigating circumstances, and

(B) The reservist submits a description of the circumstances in writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the reservist that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances, or at a later date if the reservist is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances.

(2) If VA considers that mitigating circumstances exist because the reservist withdrew during a drop-add period or because the withdrawal constitutes the first withdrawal of no more than six credits after May 31, 1989, the reservist is not subject to the reporting requirement found in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
