(c)(1) If the debtor, within thirty days of the date of the notification required by paragraph (b) of this section, disputes, in writing, the existence or amount of the debt in accordance with § 1.911(c)(1), offset shall not commence until the dispute is reviewed as provided in § 1.911(c)(1) and unless the resolution is adverse to the debtor.

(2) If the debtor, within thirty days of the date of notification required by paragraph (b) of this section, requests, in writing, waiver of collection in accordance with § 1.963 or § 1.964, as applicable, offset shall not commence until the Department of Veterans Affairs has made an initial decision on waiver.
