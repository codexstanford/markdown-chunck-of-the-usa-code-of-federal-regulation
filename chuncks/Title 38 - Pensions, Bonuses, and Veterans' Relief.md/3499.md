###### Termination for convenience.

(b)The Department of Veterans Affairs or the grantee may terminate a grant in whole or in part when both parties agree that the continuation of the project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial terminations, the portion to be terminated. The grantee shall not incur new obligations for the terminated portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Department of Veterans Affairs share of the noncancellable obligations, properly incurred by the grantee prior to termination.
