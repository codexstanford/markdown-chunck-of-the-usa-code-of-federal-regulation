##### Rating Considerations Relative to Specific Diseases
###### ยง 3.371 Presumptive service connection for tuberculous disease; wartime and service on or after January 1, 1947.
####### Pulmonary tuberculosis.

(a)(1) Evidence of activity on comparative study of X-ray films showing pulmonary tuberculosis within the 3-year presumptive period provided by ยง 3.307(a)(3) will be taken as establishing service connection for active pulmonary tuberculosis subsequently diagnosed by approved methods but service connection and evaluation may be assigned only from the date of such diagnosis or other evidence of clinical activity.

(2) A notation of inactive tuberculosis of the reinfection type at induction or enlistment definitely prevents the grant of service connection under ยง 3.307 for active tuberculosis, regardless of the fact that it was shown within the appropriate presumptive period.
