####### Services must be part of a vocational training program.

(a)Independent living services may be provided as a part of a veteran's IWRP when such services are indispensable to the achievement of the vocational goal, but may not be provided as the sole program of rehabilitation for the veteran, since a vocational training program for the veteran must be found reasonably feasible before the IWRP is prepared.
