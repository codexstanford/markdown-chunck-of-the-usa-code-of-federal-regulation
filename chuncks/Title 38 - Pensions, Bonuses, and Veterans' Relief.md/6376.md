####### Claims by veterans under age 45 for whom participation in an evaluation is required.

(a)A veteran under age 45 who is awarded pension during the program period will be scheduled for an evaluation to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, unless it is determined that the veteran is unable to participate in an evaluation for reasons beyond his or her control. If VA, as a result of the evaluation, determines that achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, the veteran may elect to pursue a vocational training program. To make this election, the veteran must file a claim, in a form prescribed by VA, for services under this temporary program.
