####### Actions affecting groups.

(d)(1) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction may:

(i) Suspend payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons already enrolled in a course;

(ii) Disapprove all further enrollments or reenrollments of individuals seeking VA educational assistance for pursuit of the course (except for enrollments and reenrollments of servicemembers seeking to be paid benefits (tuition assistance top-up) to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance); and

(iii) Suspend payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, or eligible persons who may take a licensing or certification test after a date that the Director may determine.

(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (i) of this section, the decision to act as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be based on evidence of a substantial pattern of veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons enrolled in the course or taking the test receiving educational assistance to which they are not entitled because:

(i) One or more of the course approval requirements of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 are not met, including the course approval requirements specified in §§ 21.4253, 21.4254, 21.4261, 21.4262, 21.4263, 21.4264, and 21.4268; or

(ii) The educational institution offering the course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or of 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, 33, 35, and 36. These violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(A) Willful and knowing submission of false reports or certifications concerning students or courses of education;

(B) Failure to report to VA a veteran's, servicemember's, reservist's, or eligible person's reduction, discontinuance, or termination of education or training; or

(C) Submission of improper or incorrect reports in such number, manner, or period of time as to indicate negligence on its part, including failure to maintain an adequate reporting or recordkeeping system.

(3) The Director also may make a decision to take the action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when the Director has evidence that one or more prohibited assignments of benefits have occurred at an educational institution as a result of that educational institution's policy. This decision may be made regardless of whether there is a substantial pattern of erroneous payments at the educational institution. See § 21.4146.

(4) The Director may disapprove the enrollment of all individuals not already enrolled in an educational institution (which for the purposes of this paragraph does not include a training establishment) when the Director finds that the educational institution:

(i) Has charged or received from veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons an amount for tuition and fees in excess of the amount similarly circumstanced nonveterans are required to pay for the same course; or

(ii) Has instituted a policy or practice with respect to the payment of tuition, fees, or other established charges that substantially denies to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons the benefits of advance payment of educational assistance authorized to such individuals under § 21.4138(a), § 21.7140(a), § 21.7640(d), or § 21.9680; or

(iii) Has used erroneous, deceptive, or misleading practices as set forth in § 21.4252(h).
