###### Nationwide 80th percentile to median charge ratios.,to

(B)For each CPT/HCPCS code, a geographically normalized nationwide 80th percentile billed charge amount is divided by a similarly normalized nationwide median billed charge amount. The weighted average of these ratios for each APC is then obtained, using the reported 5 Percent Sample frequencies as weights. In addition, corresponding ratios are calculated for each of the APC categories set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(D) of this section, again using the reported 5 Percent Sample frequencies as weights. For APCs where the 5 Percent Sample frequencies provide a statistically credible result, the APC-specific weighted average nationwide 80th percentilemedian charge ratio so obtained is accepted without further adjustment. However, if the 5 Percent Sample data do not produce statistically credible results for any specific APC, then the APC category-specific ratio is applied for that APC.
