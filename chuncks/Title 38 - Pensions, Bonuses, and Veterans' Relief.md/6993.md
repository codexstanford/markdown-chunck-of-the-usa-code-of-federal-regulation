(n)(1) If VA does not timely receive a required certification of attendance for a reservist enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree, VA will terminate payments effective the last date of the last period for which a certification of the reservist's attendance was received. If VA later receives the certification, VA will make any adjustment on the basis of facts found.

(2) In the case of an advance payment, if VA does not receive verification of enrollment and certificate of delivery of the check within 60 days of the first day of the term, quarter, semester, or course for which the advance payment was made, VA will determine the actual facts and make an adjustment, if required. If the reservist failed to enroll, termination will be effective the beginning date of the enrollment period.
