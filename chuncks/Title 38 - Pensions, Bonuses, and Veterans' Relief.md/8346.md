(ii) Under 38 CFR 1.218(b)(5), the destruction, mutilation, defacement, injury, or removal of any monument, gravestone, or other structure within the limits of any national cemetery is prohibited, with an associated fine of $500. Under 18 U.S.C. 1361, willful depredation of any property of the United States (a headstone or marker in a non-national cemetery) shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment under title 18 of the United States Code.

(iii) When a Government-furnished memorial headstone or marker is removed from any cemetery (due to it warranting replacement under paragraph (b)(3) of this section), it should be properly disposed. Unless a memorial headstone or marker that has been removed from a cemetery would be maintained by NCA for historic purposes, such headstones and markers made of stone must be physically broken into small enough pieces to ensure no portion of the inscription is legible and to ensure no part is available for any private, personal, or commercial use, and those made of bronze must be returned to VA for recycling.
