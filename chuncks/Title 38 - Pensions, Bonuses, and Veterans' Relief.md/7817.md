###### Automobile (or similar) allowance.

(7)Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related to an applicant's employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset a corresponding car payment. However, in some instances, such an allowance may exceed the car payment. With proper documentation, income from a car allowance which exceeds the car payment can be counted as effective income. Likewise, any other similar type of allowance which exceeds the specific expense involved may be added to gross income to the extent it is documented to exceed the actual expense.
