####### Educational assistance.

(a)Although educational assistance is paid only once in a term, quarter, or semester, VA may discontinue it under the circumstances stated in § 21.5835. The discontinuance may cause an overpayment. (See also § 21.5838.) If the individual dies during an enrollment period, the provisions of § 21.5835(a) will apply, even if other types of discontinuances are involved. In all other cases where more than one type of reduction or discontinuance is involved, the earliest date found in § 21.5835 will control.
