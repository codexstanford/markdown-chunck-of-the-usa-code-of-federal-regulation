##### ยง 1.990 Written agreement to repay debt as alternative to salary offset.
###### VA response.

(b)In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, VA will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within VA's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, VA will balance its interest in collecting the debt against the hardship to the employee. VA will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in extreme hardship.
