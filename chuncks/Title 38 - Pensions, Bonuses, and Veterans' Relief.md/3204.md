###### Charge adjustment factors for specified CPT/HCPCS code modifiers.

(4)Surcharges are calculated in the following manner: From the Part B component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 Percent Sample, the ratio of weighted average billed charges for CPT/HCPCS codes with the specified modifier to the weighted average billed charge for CPT/HCPCS codes with no charge modifier is calculated, using the frequency of procedure codes with the modifier as weights in both weighted average calculations. The resulting ratios constitute the surcharge factors for specified charge-significant CPT/HCPCS code modifiers.
