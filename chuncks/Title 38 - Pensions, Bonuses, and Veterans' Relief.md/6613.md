####### Reduction in basic pay.

(2)The basic pay of anyone who makes one of the irrevocable elections described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is required by 38 U.S.C. 3018B to be reduced by $1,200.

(i) If for any reason the basic pay of an individual who received an involuntary separation is not so reduced by $1,200, the failure to make the reduction will not affect the individual's eligibility for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30.

(ii) If the individual is voluntarily separated, such reduction of the individual's basic pay by $1,200 is a precondition to establishing eligibility. Hence, educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 may not be paid to such an individual when the reduction does not occur.
