###### Horizontal condominiums.

(2)Department of Veterans Affairs policies and procedures applicable to single-family residential construction shall also apply to horizontal condominiums. Proposed or existing (declarant in control or marketing units) horizontal condominium conversions shall comply with current local building codes for alterations and improvements or repairs made to convert the building to the condominium form of ownership unless local authorities require total code compliance on the entire structure when a building is being converted to the condominium form of ownership. In those areas where local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be required from a professional architect and/or registered engineer certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of the national building codes which is typical of similar construction methods and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions of the condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or repaired must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
