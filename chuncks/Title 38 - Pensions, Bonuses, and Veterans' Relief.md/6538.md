####### Continuous active duty.,continuous active duty

(6)(i) The termmeans active duty served without interruption. An interruption in service will only be found when the individual receives a complete separation from active duty.

(ii) A period during which an individual on active duty is assigned full time by the Armed Forces to a civilian institution for a course of education substantially the same as established courses offered to civilians will not interrupt the continuity of the individual's active duty.

(iii) If an individual, during an obligated period of active-duty service, is separated from active duty to pursue a course of education at a service academy or a post-secondary school preparatory to enrollment at a service academy, no interruption in service will be found and the individual's service will be considered continuous active-duty service, provided he or she-

(A) Commences pursuit of a course of education at a service academy or post-secondary school,

(B) Fails to complete the course of education, and

(C) Immediately reenters on a period of active duty.

(iv) An individual who is discharged or released from active duty for a reason stated in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section after serving not more than 12 months of an obligated period of active duty, and who subsequently reenlists or reenters on a period of active duty, will not be considered to have an interruption in service. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vi) of this section, the individual's service during the two periods will be considered continuous active-duty service for the aggregate length of the two service periods. However, the individual's discharge or release from the earlier obligated period of service must have been:

(A) For a service-connected disability;

(B) For hardship;

(C) For a medical condition which preexisted such active-duty service and is not service connected;

(D) For a physical or mental condition not characterized as a disability and not resulting from the individual's own willful misconduct which interfered with the individual's performance of duty as determined by the Secretary concerned; or

(E) Involuntary, for the convenience of the Government as a result of a reduction in force as determined by the Secretary concerned.

(v) VA will not consider an individual to have an interruption of service when he or she:

(A) Serves a period of active duty without interruption (without a complete separation from active duty), as an enlisted member or warrant officer;

(B) While serving on such active duty is assigned to officer training school; and

(C) Following successful completion of the officer training school is discharged to accept, without a break in service, a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces for a period of active duty.

(vi) If the second period of active-duty service referred to in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) or (b)(6)(v) of this section is of such nature or character that, when aggregated with the earlier period of service referred to in that paragraph, it would cause the individual to be divested of entitlement to educational assistance otherwise established by the earlier period of active duty, the two periods of service will not be aggregated and will not be considered a single period of continuous active duty.

(vii) Time lost will not be considered to interrupt the continuity of service. For the purpose of this section, "time lost" includes excess leave, noncreditable time and not-on-duty time.
