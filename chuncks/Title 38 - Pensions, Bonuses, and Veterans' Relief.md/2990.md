##### § 17.47 Considerations applicable in determining eligibility for hospital care, medical services, nursing home care, or domiciliary care.

(a)(1) For applicants discharged or released for disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty and who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected or service-aggravated disability, the official records of the Armed Forces relative to findings of line of duty for its purposes will be accepted in determining eligibility for hospital care or medical services. Where the official records of the Armed Forces show a finding of disability not incurred or aggravated in line of duty and evidence is submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs which permits of a different finding, the decision of the Armed Forces will not be binding upon the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will be free to make its own determination of line of duty incurrence or aggravation upon evidence so submitted. It will be incumbent upon the applicant to present controverting evidence and, until such evidence is presented and a determination favorable to the applicant is made by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the finding of the Armed Forces will control and hospital care or medical services will not be authorized. Such controverting evidence, when received from an applicant, will be referred to the adjudicating agency which would have jurisdiction if the applicant was filing claim for pension or disability compensation, and the determination of such agency as to line of duty, which is promptly to be communicated to the head of the field facility receiving the application for hospital care or medical services , will govern the facility Director's disapproval or approval of such care or services,other eligibility requirements having been met. Where the official records of the Armed Forces show that the disability for which a veteran was discharged or released from the Armed Forces under other than dishonorable conditions was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, such showing will be accepted for the purpose of determining his or her eligibility for hospital care or medical services, notwithstanding the fact that the Department of Veterans Affairs has made a determination in connection with a claim for monetary benefits that the disability was incurred or aggravated not in line of duty.

(2) In those exceptional cases where the official records of the Armed Forces show discharge or release under other than dishonorable conditions because of expiration of period of enlistment or any other reason except disability, but also show a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty during the said enlistment; and the disability so recorded is considered in medical judgment to be or to have been of such character, duration, and degree as to have justified a discharge or release for disability had the period of enlistment not expired or other reason for discharge or release been given, the Under Secretary for Health, upon consideration of a clear, full statement of circumstances, is authorized to approve hospital care or medical services, provided other eligibility requirements are met. A typical case of this kind will be one where the applicant was under treatment for the said disability recorded during his or her service at the time discharge or release was given for the reason other than disability.

(b)(1) Under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1), veterans who are receiving disability compensation awarded under § 3.362 of this chapter, where a disease, injury or the aggravation of an existing disease or injury occurs as a result of VA examination, medical or surgical treatment, or of hospitalization in a VA health care facility or of participation in a rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. ch. 31, under any law administered by VA and not the result of his/her own willful misconduct. Treatment may be provided for the disability for which the compensation is being paid or for any other disability. Treatment under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1) may not be authorized during any period when disability compensation under § 3.362 of this title is not being paid because of the provision of § 3.362(b), except to the extent continuing eligibility for such treatment is provided for in the judgment for settlement described in § 3.362(b) of this title.
