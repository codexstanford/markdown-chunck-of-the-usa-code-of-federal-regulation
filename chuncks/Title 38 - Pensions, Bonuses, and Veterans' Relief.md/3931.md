## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 17 - MEDICAL
#### Payment or Reimbursement for Emergency Services for Nonservice-Connected Conditions in Non-VA Facilities
##### ยง 17.1002 Substantive conditions for payment or reimbursement.
###### e.g.,

(f) The veteran does not have coverage under a health-plan contract that would fully extinguish the medical liability for the emergency treatment (this condition cannot be met if the veteran has coverage under a health-plan contract but payment is barred because of a failure by the veteran or the provider to comply with the provisions of that health-plan contract,failure to submit a bill or medical records within specified time limits, or failure to exhaust appeals of the denial of payment);

(g) If the condition for which the emergency treatment was furnished was caused by an accident or work-related injury, the claimant has exhausted without success all claims and remedies reasonably available to the veteran or provider against a third party for payment of such treatment; and the veteran has no contractual or legal recourse against a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the purpose of extinguishing, in whole, the veteran's liability to the provider; and

(h) The veteran is not eligible for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1728 for the emergency treatment provided (38 U.S.C. 1728 authorizes VA payment or reimbursement for emergency treatment to a limited group of veterans, primarily those who receive emergency treatment for a service-connected disability).
