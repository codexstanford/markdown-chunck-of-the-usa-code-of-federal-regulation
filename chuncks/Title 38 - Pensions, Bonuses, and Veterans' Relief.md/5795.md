####### Normal commuting distance.

(m)Two locations that are within 55 miles of each other are within normal commuting distance. Furthermore, a branch, extension or additional facility of a school located more than 55 miles from the school's main campus or parent facility will be considered within normal commuting distance only if:

(1) School records show that, prior to the establishment of the additional teaching site, at least 20 students or 5 percent of the enrollment, whichever is the lesser, on the main campus or parent facility were regularly commuting from the area where the additional teaching site is located; or

(2) Other comparable evidence clearly shows that students commute regularly between the two locations.
