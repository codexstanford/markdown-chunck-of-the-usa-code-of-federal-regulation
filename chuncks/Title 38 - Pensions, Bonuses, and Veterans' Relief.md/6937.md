##### Eligibility
###### ยง 21.7551 Extended period of eligibility.
####### Period of eligibility may be extended.

(a)VA shall grant an extension of a delimiting period determined by ยง 21.7550(a) of this part provided:

(1) The individual applies for an extension within the time period specified in ยง 21.1033(c) of subpart B.

(2) The individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period, because of a physical or mental disability, which is not the result of the reservist's own willful misconduct, and which was incurred in or aggravated by service in the Selected Reserve. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. (See ยง 21.7520(b)(29)). Evidence must establish that such a program of education was medically infeasible. VA will not grant a reservist an extension for a period of disability which was 30 days or less unless the evidence establishes that the reservist was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program, or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.
