##### Deceased.

The term "deceased" means death established by either neurological criteria (brain death) or cardiopulmonary criteria (cardiac death). Brain death is the irreversible cessation of all brain function. Cardiac death is the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function. In both cases, "irreversible" means that function will not resume spontaneously and will not be restarted artificially.
