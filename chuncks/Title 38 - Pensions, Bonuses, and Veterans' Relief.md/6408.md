###### ยง 21.6054 Criteria for determining good employment potential.
####### Negative determinations.

(e)If VA does not find good employment potential, VA will notify the veteran that he or she is not eligible to receive an evaluation. Since this finding will preclude program participation, the veteran will be informed of his or her appellate rights as described in ยง 21.59 of this part.

(1) If the determination cannot be made on the evidence of record, VA shall advise the veteran and may provide him or her with an opportunity to submit additional information within a reasonable time.

(2) A veteran's disagreement with a negative finding shall be considered evidence of motivation for employment, and may, when considered in relation to other information, provide a basis for finding that good employment potential exists;

(3) If the final VA determination, following a review of a contested negative finding, is that good potential for achieving employment does not exist, a personal interview will be scheduled, and the reasons for VA's determination shall be discussed with the veteran.
