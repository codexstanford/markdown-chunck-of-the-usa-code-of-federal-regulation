##### Transfer of Entitlement to Basic Educational Assistance to Dependents

####### Rate of payment of educational assistance.

(k)VA will apply the rules in § 21.7136 or § 21.7137 (and the rules in § 21.7138 when applicable) to determine the educational assistance rate that would apply to the transferor. VA will pay the dependent the monthly rate of educational assistance that would be payable to the transferor except that VA will-

(1) Exclude the transferor's kicker for service in the Selected Reserve (§§ 21.7136(g) and 21.7137(e)) if the transferor is eligible for such kicker;

(2) Include the dependent's Selected Reserve kicker, if the dependent is eligible for a kicker from the Selected Reserve based on the dependent's own Selected Reserve service; and

(3) Disregard the fact that either the transferor or the dependent is on (or both are on) active duty and pay the veteran rate rather than the rate applicable to individuals on active duty.
