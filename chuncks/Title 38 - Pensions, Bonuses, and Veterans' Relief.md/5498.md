####### Parent or guardian

(d)means a natural or adoptive parent, a fiduciary legally appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction or any person who is determined to be otherwise legally vested with the care of the eligible person (38 U.S.C. 3501(a)(4)) or it may be the eligible person if he or she has attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence as shown on the application and is under no known legal disability. (38 U.S.C. 3501(b)) The eligible person may be designated as the person by whom required actions may be taken even though he or she has not attained majority, or having attained majority, is under a legal disability, when it is determined that to do otherwise would not be in his or her best interest, would result in undue delay or would not be administratively feasible. Where necessary to protect his or her interest and there is reason why the eligible person should not act for himself or herself, some other individual may be designated as the person by whom required actions should be taken.
