####### Overpayment cases.

(f)VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is waived and not recovered, or is compromised.

(1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

(2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

(3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by-

(i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees;

(ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balances as determined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, course costs and marshal fees);

(iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees); and

(iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.
