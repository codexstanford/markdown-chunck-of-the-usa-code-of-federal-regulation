# Title 38 - Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief
## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 36 - LOAN GUARANTY
#### Subpart C - Assistance to Eligible Individuals in Acquiring Specially Adapted Housing
##### ยง 36.4402 Grant types.
###### Duplication of benefits.

(d)(1) If an individual is determined eligible for a 2101(a) grant, he or she may not subsequently receive a 2101(b) grant.

(2) If an individual is determined eligible for a 2101(b) grant, and becomes eligible for a 2101(a) grant, he or she may receive 2101(a) grants and TRA grants up to the aggregate amount of assistance available for 2101(a) grants. However, any 2101(b) or TRA grants received by the individual before he or she was determined eligible for the 2101(a) grant will count towards the six grant limit in ยง 36.4403.

(3) If the Secretary has provided assistance to an eligible individual under 38 U.S.C. 1717, the Secretary will not provide assistance under this subpart that would result in duplicate payments for the same adaptations. However, nothing in this subpart prohibits an eligible individual from utilizing the assistance authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1717 and 38 U.S.C. chapter 21 simultaneously, provided that no duplicate payments result.
