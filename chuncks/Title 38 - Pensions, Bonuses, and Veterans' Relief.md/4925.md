####### Long-range goals.

(b)A change in the statement of a long-range goal may only be made following a reevaluation of the veteran's rehabilitation program by the CP or VRC. A change may be made when:

(1) Achievement of the current goal(s) is no longer reasonably feasible; or

(2) The veteran's circumstances have changed or new information has been developed which makes rehabilitation more likely if a different long-range goal is established; and

(3) The veteran fully participates and concurs in the change.
