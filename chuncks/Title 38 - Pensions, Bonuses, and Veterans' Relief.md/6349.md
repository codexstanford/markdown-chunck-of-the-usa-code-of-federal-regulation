####### Educational assistance.

(a)If an individual receives educational assistance but the educational assistance must be discontinued according to ยง 21.5835, the amount of educational assistance attributable to the portion of the term, quarter or semester following the effective date of discontinuance shall constitute a debt due the United States.

(1) The amount of the debt is equal to the product of-

(i) The number of days the individual was entitled to receive subsistence allowance during the enrollment period for which educational assistance was paid, divided by the total number of days in that enrollment period, and

(ii) The amount of educational assistance provided for that enrollment period.

(2) Nothing in this method of calculation shall change the fact that the number of months of educational assistance to which the individual remains entitled shall always be the same as the number of months of subsistence allowance to which the individual is entitled.
