####### Concurrent enrollment.

(a)When a reservist cannot schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the reservist must show that his or her complete program of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program. A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in ยง 21.7540 (b)(2) and (b)(3), may pursue courses only at an institution of higher learning. If such a reservist cannot complete his or her program at one institution of higher learning, VA may approve a concurrent enrollment only if both the educational institutions the reservist enrolls in are institutions of higher learning.
