####### Application.

(b)(1) Only the veteran may apply for an extended period of eligibility pursuant to this section. A spouse or child to whom entitlement may be or has been transferred may not apply for, nor receive, an extension based upon disability of either the veteran or the spouse or child.

(2) The veteran must apply for the extended period of eligibility in time for VA to receive the application by the later of the following dates:

(i) One year from the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable to the veteran under ยง 21.5041, or

(ii) One year from the termination date of the period of the veteran's mental or physical disability.

(3) No application for an extended period of eligibility should be submitted and none will be processed during any period when the veteran has transferred entitlement to a spouse or child, since eligibility cannot be fully determined as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
