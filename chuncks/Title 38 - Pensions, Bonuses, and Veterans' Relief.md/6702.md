####### Concurrent enrollment.

(a)(1) When a veteran or servicemember cannot successfully schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the veteran or servicemember must show that his or her complete program of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled successfully within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program. When the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two educational institutions are different, the concurrent enrollment shall be measured by converting the measurement of courses being pursued at the second educational institution under the standard applicable to such institution to its equivalent measurement under the standard required for full-time courses applicable to the primary educational institution. For a complete discussion of measurement of concurrent enrollments see ยง 21.7172 of this part.

(2) The veteran or servicemember must submit the monthly certification of attendance and pursuit. Each educational institution where concurrent enrollment is approved must either endorse that certification, or submit a separate certification showing the veteran's or servicemember's enrollment and pursuit.
