###### Discharge or release.

For purposes of basic eligibility a person will be considered discharged or released if the veteran was issued a discharge certificate under conditions other than dishonorable (38 U.S.C. 3702(c)). The term discharge or release includes-

(1) Retirement from the active military, naval, or air service, and

(2) The satisfactory completion of the period of active military, naval, or air service for which a person was obligated at the time of entry into such service in the case of a person who, due to enlistment or reenlistment, was not awarded a discharge or release from such period of service at the time of such completion thereof and who, at such time, would otherwise have been eligible for the award of a discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable.
