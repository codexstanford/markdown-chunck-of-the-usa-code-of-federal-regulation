###### ยง 21.7172 Measurement of concurrent enrollments.
####### Conversion of units of measurement required.

(a)Where a veteran enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for the measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the veteran is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:

(1) If VA measures the courses at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.

(2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.

(3) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and

(i) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a mixed basis, the courses pursued at the second school which VA can measure on credit-hour basis for at least one program at the second school will be converted to clock hours and the resulting clock hours added to determine the veteran's training time; or

(ii) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.
