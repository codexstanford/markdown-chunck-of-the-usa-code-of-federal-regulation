###### § 36.4209 Reporting requirements.

(a) Each loan proposed for guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall, unless otherwise provided in the § 36.4200 series, be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to closing. The Secretary upon determining any such proposed loan to be eligible for guaranty will issue a certificate of commitment.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty upon the ultimate actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days thereafter of a supplemental report showing such fact and:

(1) That the loan conforms to the terms of the certificate of commitment;

(2) The identity of all property purchased therewith, including the itemized list required by § 36.4204(f);

(3) That all property purchased with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the § 36.4200 series;

(4) In respect to any property purchased with the loan proceeds as to which the Secretary issued a certificate of reasonable value which was conditioned upon completion of any construction, repairs, alterations or improvements not inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary that such construction, repairs, alterations or improvements have been completed according to the plans and specifications upon which such reasonable value was based; and

(5) That the loan conforms otherwise to the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and § 36.4200 series.

(c) A deviation of more than five (5) percent between the estimates upon which the certificate of commitment was issued and the report of final payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the property acquired by the veteran with the loan proceeds will invalidate the certificate of commitment, unless such deviation or change is approved by the Secretary.
