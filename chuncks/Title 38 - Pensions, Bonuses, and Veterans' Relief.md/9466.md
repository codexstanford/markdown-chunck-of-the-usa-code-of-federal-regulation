means an eligible veteran whose Family Caregiver(s) was approved and designated by VA under this part as of the day before October 1, 2020 so long as the Primary Family Caregiver approved and designated for the eligible veteran as of the day before October 1, 2020 (as applicable) continues to be approved and designated as such.
