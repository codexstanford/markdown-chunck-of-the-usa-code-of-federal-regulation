####### Additional instruction requirements.

(2)The State approving agency will apply the following additional requirements to a flight course:

(i) All flight instruction, instruction by flight training device, flight simulator instruction, preflight briefings and postflight critiques, and ground school training in a course must be given by the flight school or under suitable arrangements between the school and another school or entity such as a local community college.

(ii) All ground school training connected with the course must be in residence under the direction and supervision of a qualified instructor providing an opportunity for interaction between the students and the instructor. Simply making provision for having an instructor available to answer questions does not satisfy this requirement.

(3) A flight school must keep at a minimum the following records for each eligible veteran, servicemember, or reservist pursuing flight training:

(i) A copy of his or her private pilot certificate;

(ii) Evidence of completion of any prior training that may be a prerequisite for the course;

(iii) A copy of the medical certificate required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the courses being pursued and copies of all medical certificates (expired or otherwise) needed to support all periods of prior instruction received at the current school;

(iv) A daily flight log or copy thereof;

(v) A permanent ground school record;

(vi) A progress log;

(vii) An invoice of flight changes for individual flights or flight lessons for training conducted on a flight simulator or advanced flight training device;

(viii) Daily flight sheets identifying records upon which the 85-15 percent ratio may be computed;

(ix) A continuous meter record for each aircraft;

(x) An invoice or flight tickets signed by the student and instructor showing hour meter reading, type of aircraft, and aircraft identification number;

(xi) An accounts receivable ledger;

(xii) Individual instructor records;

(xiii) Engine log books;

(xiv) A record for each student above the private pilot level stating the name of the course in which the student is currently enrolled and indicating whether the student is enrolled under 14 CFR part 61, part 63, part 141, or part 142;

(xv) Records of tuition and accounts which are evidence of tuition charged and received from all students; and

(xvi) If training is provided under 14 CFR part 141, the records required by that part, or if training is provided under 14 CFR part 142, the records required by that part.
