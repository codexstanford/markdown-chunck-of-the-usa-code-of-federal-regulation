####### General.

(a)If VA determines that a veteran has failed to maintain satisfactory conduct or cooperation, VA may, after determining that all reasonable counseling efforts have been made and are found not reasonably likely to be effective, discontinue services and assistance to the veteran, unless the case manager determines that mitigating circumstances exist. In any case in which such services and assistance have been discontinued, VA may reinstitute such services and assistance only if the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) determines that:

(1) The unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation of such veteran will not be likely to recur; and

(2) The rehabilitation program which the veteran proposes to pursue (whether the same or revised) is suitable to such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
