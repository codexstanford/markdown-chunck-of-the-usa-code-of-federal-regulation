##### ยง 20.1403 Rule 1403. What constitutes clear and unmistakable error; what does not.
###### Errors that constitute clear and unmistakable error.

(c)To warrant revision of a Board decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error, there must have been an error in the Board's adjudication of the appeal which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome when it was made. If it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be clear and unmistakable.
