####### Conversion of credit hours to clock hours.

(c)If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require the Department of Veterans Affairs to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by-

(1) Dividing the number of clock hours which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and

(2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will drop all fractional hours.
