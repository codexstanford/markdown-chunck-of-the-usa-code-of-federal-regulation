####### Adjustments in the training situation.

(b)The counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor must be continually aware of the eligible person's progress. At frequent intervals he or she will determine whether the eligible person is progressing satisfactorily. When the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that adjustments are needed in the course or in the training situation, he or she will act immediately to bring about the adjustments in accordance with the following:

(1) When the eligible person or his or her instructor indicates dissatisfaction with elements of the program, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor, through personal discussion with the eligible person or his or her instructor or both, will, if possible, correct the difficulty through such means as making minor adjustments in the course or by persuading the eligible person to give more attention to performance.

(2) When major difficulties cannot be corrected, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will prepare a report of pertinent facts and recommendations for action in consultation with the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel.

(3) Action will be taken to terminate the eligible person's course at the proper time so that his or her entitlement may be conserved when the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that:

(i) The eligible person is progressing much faster than anticipated, and

(ii) The eligible person's course may be terminated with satisfactory results before the time originally planned.
