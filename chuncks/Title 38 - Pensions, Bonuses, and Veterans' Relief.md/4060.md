# Title 38 - Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief
## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 17 - MEDICAL
#### Clinical Laboratory Standards
##### ยง 17.3500 VA application of 42 CFR part 493 standards for clinical laboratory operations.
###### Accreditation by a private, nonprofit accreditation organization or exemption under an approved state laboratory program.

(e)All provisions in subpart E of 42 CFR part 493 apply to VA, to the extent that this subpart addresses accreditation by a private, nonprofit accreditation organization. VA applies this subpart as follows:

(1) VA relies on CMS to grant deeming authority for accreditation organizations. VA uses only an accreditation agency with deeming authority to determine whether a laboratory is in compliance with standards established by the accreditation organization. VA determines whether the laboratory is in compliance with any additional standard established by VA which is:

(i) More stringent than that required for accreditation purposes, or

(ii) Not addressed by accreditation standards or 42 CFR part 493.

(2) VA uses only CMS-approved proficiency testing providers.

(3) Proficiency testing providers release proficiency testing results directly to VA.

(4) VA, rather than CMS, performs inspections of VA laboratories.

(5) Oversight and enforcement functions under this subpart are performed by VA.
