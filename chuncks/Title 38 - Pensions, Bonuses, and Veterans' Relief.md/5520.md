####### Child; election.

(c)An election by a child under this section must be submitted to VA in writing.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an election to receive Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is final when the eligible child commences a program of education under DEA (38 U.S.C. chapter 35). Commencement of a program of education under DEA will be deemed to have occurred for VA purposes on the date the first payment of DEA educational assistance is made, as evidenced by negotiation of the first check or receipt of the first payment by electronic funds transfer.

(2) An election based on erroneous information furnished by an authorized representative of the Department of Veterans Affairs is not considered final.

(3) A child other than a helpless child, whose eligibility was based on a finding that the veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability and who commenced a program of education under DEA may not thereafter qualify as a dependent for disability compensation purposes if the veteran is later found to be less than permanently and totally disabled, or for pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation after the veteran's death.
