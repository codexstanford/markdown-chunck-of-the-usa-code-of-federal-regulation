(2)The securing of appropriate fidelity bond coverage is recommended but not required, for any person or entity handling funds of the owners' association, including, but not limited to, employees of the professional managers. Such fidelity bonds should name the association as an obligee, and be written in an amount equal to at least the estimated maximum of funds, including reserve funds, in the custody of the owners' association or the management agent at any given time during the term of the fidelity bond. However, the bond should not be less than a sum equal to 3 months' aggregate assessments on all units plus reserve funds.
