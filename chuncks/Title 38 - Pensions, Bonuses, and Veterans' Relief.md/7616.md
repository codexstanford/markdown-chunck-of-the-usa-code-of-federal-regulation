(a) The interest in the realty constituting a manufactured home lot acquired by the veteran wholly or in part with the proceeds of a guaranteed loan, or in the realty constituting a manufactured home lot improved wholly or in part with the proceeds of a guaranteed loan, shall not be less than:

(1) A fee simple estate therein, legal or equitable; or

(2) A leasehold estate running or renewable at the option of the lessee for a period of not less than 14 years from the maturity of the loan, or to any earlier date at which the fee simple title will vest in the lessee, which is assignable or transferable, if the same be subjected to the lien; however, a leasehold estate which is not freely assignable and transferable will be considered an acceptable estate if it is determined by the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, (i) that such type of leasehold is customary in the area where the property is located, (ii) that a veteran or veterans will be prejudiced if the requirement for free assignability is adhered to and, (iii) that the assignability and other provisions applicable to the leasehold estate are sufficient to protect the interests of the veteran and the Government and are otherwise acceptable; or

(3) A life estate, provided that the remainder and reversionary interests are subjected to the lien; or

(4) A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the veteran, or veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under State law.

(b) Any such property or estate will not fail to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by reason of the following:

(1) Encroachments;

(2) Easements;

(3) Servitudes;

(4) Reservations for water, timber, or subsurface rights;

(5) Right in any grantor or cotenant in the chain of title, or a successor of either, to purchase for cash, which right by the terms thereof is exercisable only if:

(i) An owner elects to sell,

(ii) The option price is not less than the price at which the then owner is willing to sell to another, and

(iii) Exercised within 30 days after notice is mailed by certified mail to the address of optionee last known to the then owner of the then owner's election to sell, stating the price and the identity of the proposed vendee;

(6) State and local housing agency deed restrictions provided that the veteran obtained the property under a State or local political subdivision program designed to assist low- or moderate-income purchasers, and as a condition the purchaser must agree to one or more of the following restrictions:

(i) If the property is resold within a time period as established by local law or ordinance, after the purchaser acquires title, the purchaser must first offer the property to the government housing agency, or a low- or moderate-income purchaser designated by such agency, provided the option to purchase is exercised within 90 days after notice by the purchaser to the agency of intention to sell;

(ii) If the property is resold within a time period as established by local law or ordinance, after the purchaser acquires title, a governmental agency may specify a maximum price for the property upon resale; or

(iii) Such other restriction approved by the Secretary designed to insure either that a property acquired under such program again be made available to low- or moderate-income purchasers, or to prevent a private purchaser from obtaining a windfall profit on the resale of such property, while assuring that the purchaser has a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the property without undue difficulty at a reasonable price.
