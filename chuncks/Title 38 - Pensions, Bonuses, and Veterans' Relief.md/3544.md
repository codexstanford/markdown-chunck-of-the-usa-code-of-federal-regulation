(b)The CHAMPVA inpatient mental health per diem reimbursement methodology is used to calculate reimbursement for inpatient mental health hospital care in specialty psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general acute hospitals that are exempt from the CHAMPVA DRG-based payment system. The per diem rate is calculated by multiplying the daily rate by the number of days (length of stay). The daily rate is updated each fiscal year for both high volume hospitals (25 or more discharges per fiscal year) and low volume hospitals (fewer than 25 discharges per fiscal year).
