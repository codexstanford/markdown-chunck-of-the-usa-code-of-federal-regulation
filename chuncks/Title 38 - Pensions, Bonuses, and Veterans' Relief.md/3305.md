###### Copayments for inpatient hospital care.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, a veteran, as a condition of receiving inpatient hospital care provided by VA (provided either directly by VA or obtained by VA by contract, provider agreement, or sharing agreement), must agree to pay VA (and is obligated to pay VA) the applicable copayment, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.

(2) The copayment for inpatient hospital care shall be, during any 365-day period, a copayment equaling the sum of:

(i) $10 for every day the veteran receives inpatient hospital care, and

(ii) The lesser of:

(A) The sum of the inpatient Medicare deductible for the first 90 days of care and one-half of the inpatient Medicare deductible for each subsequent 90 days of care (or fraction thereof) after the first 90 days of such care during such 365-day period, or

(B) VA's cost of providing the care.

(3) The copayment for inpatient hospital care for veterans enrolled in priority category 7 shall be 20 percent of the amount computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(4) For inpatient hospital care furnished through the Veterans Choice Program under §§ 17.1500 through 17.1540, or the Veterans Community Care Program under §§ 17.4000 through 17.4040, the copayment amount at the time of furnishing such care or services by a non-VA entity or provider is $0. VA will determine and assess the veteran's copayment amount at the end of the billing process, but at no time will a veteran's copayment be more than the amount identified in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section.
