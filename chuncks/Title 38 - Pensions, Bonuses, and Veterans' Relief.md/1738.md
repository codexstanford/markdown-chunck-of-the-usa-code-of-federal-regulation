VA will inform a person whose benefits are subject to this reduction of the rights of the person's dependents to an apportionment while the person is incarcerated, and the conditions under which payments to the person may be resumed upon release from incarceration.

However, no apportionment will be made if the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon as defined in paragraph (n) of this section.
