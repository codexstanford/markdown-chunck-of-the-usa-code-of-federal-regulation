###### Declarant payment of offsite facility in a series project.

(3)Until the declarant has completed all of the intended condominium phases in a total condominium development or established each condominium regime by filing a separate declaration in a series development, the balance of the total sum of the expenses of the offsite facility not covered by the assessment against the unit owners should be assessed against and be payable by the declarant commencing on the first day of the first month after the first unit is conveyed to a homeowner in the first phase. If this balance is not paid, it must become a lien against those parcels of land in the development area which are owned by the declarant. The collection of such debt and enforcement of such lien may be by foreclosure or such other remedies afforded the corporation or association under local law.
