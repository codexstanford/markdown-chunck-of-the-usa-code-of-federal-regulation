##### § 17.73 Medical foster homes - general.
###### Approval of medical foster homes.

(d)Medical foster homes will be approved by a VA Medical Foster Homes Coordinator based on the report of a VA inspection and on any findings of necessary interim monitoring of the medical foster home, if that home meets the standards established in § 17.74. The approval process is governed by the process for approving community residential care facilities under §§ 17.65 through 17.72 except as follows:

(1) Where §§ 17.65 through 17.72 reference § 17.63.

(2) Because VA does not physically place veterans in medical foster homes, VA also does not assist veterans in moving out of medical foster homes as we do for veterans in other community residential care facilities under § 17.72(d)(2); however, VA will assist such veterans in locating an approved medical foster home when relocation is necessary.
