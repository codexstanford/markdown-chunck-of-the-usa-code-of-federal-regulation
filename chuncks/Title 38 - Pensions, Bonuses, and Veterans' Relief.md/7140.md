##### Vocational Training, Services, and Assistance
###### § 21.8120 Vocational training, services, and assistance.
####### Cost of education and training services.

(c)The CP or VRC will consider the cost of training in selecting a facility when:

(1) There is more than one facility in the area in which the child resides that:

(i) Meets the requirements for approval under §§ 21.290 through 21.298 (except as provided by § 21.8286(b)),

(ii) Can provide the training, services and other supportive assistance the child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation specifies, and

(iii) Is within reasonable commuting distance; or

(2) The child wishes to train at a suitable facility in another area, even though a suitable facility in the area where the child lives can provide the training. In considering the costs of providing training in this case, VA will use the provisions of § 21.120 (except 21.120(a)(3)), § 21.370 (however, the words "under § 21.282" in § 21.370(b)(2)(iii)(B) do not apply), and § 21.372 in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.
