(a)VA may make payments to employers to enable a veteran who has been rehabilitated to employability to begin and maintain employment or to provide on-job training. The purpose of such payment is to facilitate the placement of veterans who are generally qualified for employment but may lack some specific training or work experience which the employer requires or who are difficult to place due to their disability. The specific conditions which must be met before this option may be considered are contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
