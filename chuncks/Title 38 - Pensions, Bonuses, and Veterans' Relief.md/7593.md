Current liabilities are defined as obligations that would be paid within a year on a normal accounting or business cycle. The lender's latest financial statements (profit and loss statements and balance sheets), audited and certified by a CPA (certified public accountant), must accompany the application. If the date of the financial statement precedes that of the application by more than 6 months, the lender-applicant must also attach a copy of its latest internal quarterly report. In addition, the lender-applicant must agree that if the application is approved, the applicant will provide within 120 days following the end of each of its fiscal years an audited financial statement to the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service for review.
