## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 17 - MEDICAL
#### Hospital, Domiciliary and Nursing Home Care
##### § 17.47 Considerations applicable in determining eligibility for hospital care, medical services, nursing home care, or domiciliary care.
###### attributable income

(4) Determinations with respect to attributable income made under paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section, shall be made in the same manner, including the same sources of income and exclusions from income, as determinations with respect to income are made for determining eligibility for pension under §§ 3.271 and 3.272 of this title. The termmeans income of a veteran for the calendar year preceding application for care, determined in the same manner as the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under 38 U.S.C. 1521 would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under that section.

(5) In order to avoid hardship VA may determine that a veteran is eligible for care notwithstanding that the veteran does not meet the income requirements established in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) or (d)(2) of this section, if projections of the veteran's income for the year following application for care are substantially below the income requirements established in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) or (d)(2) of this section.

(e)(1) If VA determines that an individual was incorrectly charged a copayment, VA will refund the amount of any copayment actually paid by that individual.

(2) In the event a veteran provided inaccurate information on an application and is incorrectly deemed eligible for care under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(1) or (a)(2) rather than 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(3), VA shall retroactively bill the veteran for the applicable copayment.

(f) If a veteran who receives hospital, nursing home, or outpatient care under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(3) by virtue of the veteran's eligibility for hospital care and medical services under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a), fails to pay to the United States the amounts agreed to under those sections shall be grounds for determining, in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Under Secretary for Health, that the veteran is not eligible to receive further care under those sections until such amounts have been paid in full.

(g)(1) Persons hospitalized and/or receiving medical services who have no service-connected disabilities pursuant to § 17.47, and/or persons receiving outpatient medical services pursuant to § 17.93 who have no service-connected disabilities who it is believed may be eligible for hospital care and/or medical services, or reimbursement for the expenses of care or services for all or part of the cost thereof by reason of the following:

(i) Membership in a union, fraternal or other organization, or

(ii) Coverage under an insurance policy, or contract, medical, or hospital service agreement, membership, or subscription contract or similar arrangement under which health services for individuals are provided or the expenses of such services are paid, will not be furnished hospital care or medical services without charge therefore to the extent of the amount for which such parties referred to in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, are, will become, or may be liable. Persons believed entitled to care under any of the plans discussed above will be required to provide such information as the Secretary may require. Provisions of this paragraph are effective April 7, 1986, except in the case of a health care policy or contract that was entered into before that date, the effective date shall be the day after the plan was modified or renewed or on which there was any change in premium or coverage and will apply only to care and services provided by VA after the date the plan was modified, renewed, or on which there was any change in premium or coverage.

(2) Persons hospitalized and/or receiving medical services for the treatment of nonservice-connected disabilities pursuant to § 17.47, or persons receiving outpatient medical services pursuant to § 17.93 and who it is believed may be entitled to hospital care and/or medical services or to reimbursement for all or part of the cost thereof from any one or more of the following parties:
