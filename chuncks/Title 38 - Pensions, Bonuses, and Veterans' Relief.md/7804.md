###### Debt-to-income ratio.

(d)A debt-to-income ratio that compares the veteran's anticipated monthly housing expense and total monthly obligations to his or her stable monthly income will be computed to assist in the assessment of the potential risk of the loan. The ratio will be determined by taking the sum of the monthly Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance (PITI) of the loan being applied for, homeowners and other assessments such as special assessments, condominium fees, homeowners association fees, etc., and any long-term obligations divided by the total of gross salary or earnings and other compensation or income. The ratio should be rounded to the nearest two digits; e.g., 35.6 percent would be rounded to 36 percent. The standard is 41 percent or less. If the ratio is greater than 41 percent, the steps cited in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section apply.
