###### Requests by creditor agencies for offset.

(i)Unless the offset would not be in VA's best interest, or would otherwise be contrary to law, VA will comply with requests by creditor agencies to offset VA payments (except for current salary or benefit payments) made to a person indebted to the creditor agency. However, before VA may initiate offset, the creditor agency must certify in writing to VA that the debtor has been provided:

(1) Written notice of the type and amount of the debt and the intent of the creditor agency to use administrative offset to collect the debt;

(2) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;

(3) The opportunity for review within the agency of the determination of the indebtedness; and

(4) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.
