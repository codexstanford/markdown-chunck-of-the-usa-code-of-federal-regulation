####### General.

(a)Subject to the limitation in paragraph (b) of this section, total-disability compensation ratings may be assigned under the provisions of ยง 3.340. However, if the total rating is based on a disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities provides an evaluation of less than 100 percent, it must be determined that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age.
