###### Determining whether a veteran spent a day receiving nursing home or domiciliary care,Nursing homes.

(c)-(1)VA will pay per diem for each day that the veteran is receiving nursing home care and has an overnight stay at the State home. Per diem also will be paid for a day when there is no overnight stay if the State home nursing home care program has an occupancy rate of 90 percent or greater on that day. However, these payments will be made only for the first 10 consecutive days during which the veteran is admitted as a patient for any stay in a VA or other hospital (a hospital stay could occur more than once in a calendar year once there is an overnight stay in the State home between hospital stays) and only for the first 12 days in a calendar year during which the veteran is absent for purposes other than receiving hospital care. Occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the total number of residents (including nonveterans) in the nursing home on that day by the total recognized nursing home capacity in that State home.
