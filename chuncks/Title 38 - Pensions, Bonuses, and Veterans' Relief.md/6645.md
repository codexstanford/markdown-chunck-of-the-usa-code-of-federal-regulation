### PART 21 - VETERAN READINESS AND EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION
#### Subpart K - All Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program (Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty)
##### Eligibility
###### ยง 21.7051 Extended period of eligibility.
####### Period of eligibility may be extended.

(a)VA shall grant an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by ยง 21.7050 of this part provided:

(1) The veteran applies for an extension within the time specified in ยง 21.1033(c).

(2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the veteran's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. (See ยง 21.7020(b)(38)) It must be clearly established by medical evidence that such a program of education was medically infeasible. VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the veteran was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.
