####### Supplies furnished to a veteran in farm cooperative training.

(c)The books and related training supplies which VA may furnish a veteran in farm cooperative training depend upon the type of instruction he or she is receiving:

(1) When organized, group instruction is part of a veteran's course, VA will furnish those books and supplies which the school requires all students in the school portion of the course to own personally or on a rental basis;

(2) When all instruction is given on the veteran's farm by an individual instructor, VA will furnish to a student only those textbooks and other supplies which would ordinarily be required by a school.
