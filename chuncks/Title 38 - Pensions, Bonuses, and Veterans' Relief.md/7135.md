(ii) Reentrance is authorized under § 21.8284 in a case when the child has completed a vocational training program under this subpart.

(2) A CP or VRC may approve a change of vocational goal from one field or occupational family to another field or occupational family if the child can achieve the new goal:

(ii) Before the end of any allowable extension under §§ 21.8020(e)(2) and 21.8072 if the new vocational goal in another field or occupational family was identified during the basic 24-month entitlement period.

(3) A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family does not change the planned vocational goal.
