####### Personally purchased supplies.

(b)VA will not generally reimburse a veteran who personally buys supplies. VA may pay for the required supplies which a training facility or other vendor sells to a veteran, if the facility chooses to return to the veteran the amounts he or she paid, so that the charges stand as an unpaid obligation of VA to the facility. If the facility does not agree to such an arrangement, VA may still pay the veteran, if the facts and equities of the case are demonstrated.
