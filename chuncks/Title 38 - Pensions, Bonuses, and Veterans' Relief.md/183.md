## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
#### Court Orders Authorizing Disclosures and Use
##### § 1.493 Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosures for noncriminal purposes.
###### Application.

(a)An order authorizing the disclosure of patient records covered by §§ 1.460 through 1.499 of this part for purposes other than criminal investigation or prosecution may be applied for by any person having a legally recognized interest in the disclosure which is sought. The application may be filed separately or as part of a pending civil action in which it appears that the patient records are needed to provide evidence. An application must use a fictitious name, such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise disclose any patient identifying information unless the patient is the applicant or has given a written consent (meeting the requirements of § 1.475 of this part) to disclosure or the court has ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny.
