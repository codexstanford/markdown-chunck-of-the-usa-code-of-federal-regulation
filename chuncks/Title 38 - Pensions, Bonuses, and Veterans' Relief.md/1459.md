For the purpose of certifying civil service disability preference only, a service-connected disability may be assigned an evaluation of "less than ten percent." Any directly or presumptively service-connected disease or injury which exhibits some extent of actual impairment may be held to exist at the level of less than ten percent. For disabilities incurred in combat, however, no actual impairment is required.
