(c)Whether submitting the request by letter, fax, or email, the following applies: If the requester is seeking records about himself or herself or to which a confidentiality statute applies (38 U.S.C. 5701,), the requester must comply with the verification of identity requirements set forth in ยง 1.577 of this part, which applies to requests for records maintained under the Privacy Act. If the requester is seeking records not covered by the Privacy Act, but which the requester believes may pertain to him or her, the requester may obtain greater access to the records by complying with the verification of identity requirements set forth in ยง 1.577 of this part, by providing the image of the requester's signature (such as an attachment that shows the requester's handwritten signature), or by submitting a notarized, signed statement affirming his or her identity or a declaration made in compliance with 28 U.S.C. 1746. The suggested language for a statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746 is included on VA's FOIA homepage; see ยง 1.552(a) for the pertinent internet address. If the requester is seeking records pertaining to another individual under the FOIA, whether by letter, fax, or email, the requester may obtain greater access to the records if he or she provides satisfactory authorization to act on behalf of the record subject to receive the records or by submitting proof that the record subject is deceased (a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). Each component has discretion to require that a requester supply additional information to verify that a record subject has consented to disclosure.
