###### ยง 36.4212 Interest rates and late charges.

(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Secretary may elect to require that such loans either bear interest at a rate that is agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or bear interest at a rate not in excess of a rate established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change that election by publishing a notice in theProvided, however, that the interest rate of a loan for the purpose of an interest rate reduction under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. This paragraph (a) does not apply in the case of an adjustable rate mortgage being refinanced with a fixed rate loan.

(b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F).

(c) The rate of interest in instruments securing the indebtedness for all loans may be expressed in terms of add-on or discount.
