###### Nationwide 80th percentile charges for CPT/HCPCS codes which do not have APC assignments.

(ii)Nationwide 80th percentile billed charge levels by CPT/HCPCS code are computed from the outpatient facility component of the Fair Health database, from the MarketScan claims database, and from the outpatient facility component of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 Percent Sample. If the Fair Health database contains sufficient data to provide a statistically credible 80th percentile charge, then that result is retained for this purpose. If the Fair Health database does not provide a statistically credible 80th percentile charge, then the result from the MarketScan database is retained for this purpose, provided it is statistically credible. If neither the Fair Health nor the MarketScan databases provide statistically credible results, then the nationwide 80th percentile billed charge computed from the 5 Percent Sample data is retained for this purpose. The nationwide 80th percentile charges retained from each of these data sources are trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
