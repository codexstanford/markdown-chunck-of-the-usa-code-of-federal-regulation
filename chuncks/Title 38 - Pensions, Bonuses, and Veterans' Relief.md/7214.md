###### ยง 21.9535 Extended period of eligibility.
####### Disability extension.

(a)(1) VA will grant an extension of the period of eligibility, as determined in ยง 21.9530 (except for paragraphs (d) and (e)) provided-

(i) The individual applies for the extension within the time specified in ยง 21.1033(c); and

(ii) The medical evidence clearly establishes that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the individual's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. VA will not consider an individual's disability for a period of 30 days or less as having prevented the individual from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the individual was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance due to the short-term disability.
