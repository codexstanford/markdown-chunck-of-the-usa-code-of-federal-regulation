(a) With respect to loans automatically guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1), evidence of the guaranty will be issuable to a lender of a class described under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) if the loan is reported to the Secretary not later than 60 days following full disbursement and upon the certification of the lender that:

(1) No default exists thereunder that has continued for more than 30 days;

(2) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301, any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements effected subsequent to the appraisal of reasonable value, and paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved upon completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required in § 36.4304 concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans;

(3) The loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.

(b) Loans made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3703(a), although not entitled to automatic insurance thereunder, may, when made by a lender of a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1), be reported for issuance of an insurance credit.

(1) The identity of any property purchased therewith,

(2) That all property purchased or acquired with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,

(3) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301(c), any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and that any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required by § 36.4304, and

(4) That the loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.
