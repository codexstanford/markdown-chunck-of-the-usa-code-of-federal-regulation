####### Punitive grade.,i.e.

(k)The term means a grade assigned for pursuit of a course which is used in determining the student's overall progress toward completion of the school's requirements for graduation. Unlike the nonpunitive grade, the punitive grade does affect the criteria to be met by the student for graduation,, it is a factor in computing the student's grade average or grade point average, for example. For this reason it is not the same as an audited course, since it does have an effect upon the student's ability to meet the school's criteria for graduation. See ยง 21.4135(e).
