###### ยง 21.79 Determining entitlement usage under Chapter 31.
####### Computing entitlement.

(e)(1) The computation of entitlement is based upon the rate of program pursuit, as determined under ยง 21.310 of this part, over the elapsed time during which training and rehabilitation services were furnished;

(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the rehabilitation program as determined under ยง 21.322 of this part to the date of termination as determined under ยง 21.324 of this part. This includes the period during which veterans not receiving subsistence allowance because of a statutory bar; e.g., certain incarcerated veterans or servicepersons in a military hospital, nevertheless, received other chapter 31 services and assistance. Elapsed time includes the total period from the commencing date until the termination date, except for any period of unauthorized leave;

(3) If the veteran's rate of pursuit changes after the commencing date of the rehabilitation program, the Department of Veterans Affairs will:

(i) Separate the period of rehabilitation program services into the actual periods of time during which the veteran's rate of pursuit was different; and

(ii) Compute entitlement based on the rate of pursuit for each separate elapsed time period.
