###### Transfer and discharge requirements.

(b)At the time of intake screening, the State home must discuss the possible reasons for transfer or discharge with the participant and, to the extent practicable and appropriate, with family members (subject to the consent of the participant) or the participant's legal representatives. In the case of a transfer and discharge to a hospital, the transfer and discharge must be to the hospital closest to the adult day health care facility that can provide the necessary care. The State home must permit each participant to remain in the program of care, and not transfer or discharge the participant from the program of care unless:

(1) The transfer and discharge is necessary for the participant's welfare and the participant's needs cannot be met in the adult day health care setting;

(2) The transfer and discharge is appropriate because the participant's health has improved sufficiently so that the participant no longer needs the services provided in the adult day health care program;

(3) The safety of individuals in the facility is endangered;

(4) The health of individuals in the facility would otherwise be endangered;

(5) The participant has failed, after reasonable and appropriate notice, to pay for participation in the adult day health care program; or

(6) The adult day health care program ceases to operate.
