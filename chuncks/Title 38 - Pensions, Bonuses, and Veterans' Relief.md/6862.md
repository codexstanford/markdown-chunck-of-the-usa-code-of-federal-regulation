####### Conversion of clock hours to credit hours.

(b)If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to credit hours, it will do so by-

(1) Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and

(2) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
