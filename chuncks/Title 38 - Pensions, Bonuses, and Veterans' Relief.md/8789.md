###### Restraints.

(a)(1) The resident has a right to be free from any chemical or physical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience. When a restraint is applied or used, the purpose of the restraint is reviewed and is justified as a therapeutic intervention.

(i) Chemical restraint is the inappropriate use of a sedating psychotropic drug to manage or control behavior.

(ii) Physical restraint is any method of physically restricting a person's freedom of movement, physical activity or normal access to his or her body. Bed rails and vest restraints are examples of physical restraints.

(2) The facility management uses a system to achieve a restraint-free environment.

(3) The facility management collects data about the use of restraints.

(4) When alternatives to the use of restraint are ineffective, a restraint must be safely and appropriately used.
