###### ยง 21.5072 Entitlement charge.
####### Flight training courses.

(h)(1) A charge against the period of entitlement for pursuit of a flight training course will be one month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under ยง 21.5138(a)(5)(viii). When this computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.

(2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at under ยง 21.5138(a)(5)(viii) is $150 at the time educational assistance allowance is paid for a period of flight training, the individual will be charged one month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.
