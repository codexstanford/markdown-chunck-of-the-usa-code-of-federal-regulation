###### Nationwide 80th percentile charges for HCPCS codes without RVUs.,see

(3)For each applicable HCPCS code, 80th percentile charges are extracted from two independent data sources: The FAIR Health database and the combined Part B and DME components of the Medicare Standard Analytical File 5 Percent Sample; and Milliman, Inc., Optimized HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) Data Sets (paragraph (a)(3) of this section for Data Sources). Charges from each database are then trended forward to the effective time period for the charges, as set forth in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section. Charges for each HCPCS code from each data source are combined into an average 80th percentile charge by means of the methodology set forth in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. The results constitute the nationwide 80th percentile charge for each applicable HCPCS code.
