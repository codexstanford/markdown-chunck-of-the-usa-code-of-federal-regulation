####### informal claim

(2) If a form (either paper or electronic) has not been prescribed to use in claiming the benefit sought, the termmeans any communication, other than a formal claim, from an individual, or from an authorized representative or a Member of Congress on that individual's behalf that indicates a desire on the part of the individual to claim or to apply for VA-administered educational assistance.

(3) When VA requests evidence in connection with a claim, and the claimant submits that evidence to VA after having abandoned the claim, the claimant's submission of the evidence is an informal claim.

(4) The act of enrolling in an approved educational institution or training establishment is not an informal claim.

(5) VA will not consider a communication received from a service organization, an attorney, or agent to be an informal claim if a valid power of attorney, executed by the claimant, is not in effect at the time the communication is written.
