####### Interruption to conserve entitlement.

(d)A veteran may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An educational institution may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester, if the veteran or servicemember is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the veteran or servicemember is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:

(1) Enrollment is terminated;

(2) The veteran or servicemember cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

(3) The veteran or servicemember interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester;

(4) The veteran or servicemember requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. Whether the veteran or servicemember negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period is immaterial.
