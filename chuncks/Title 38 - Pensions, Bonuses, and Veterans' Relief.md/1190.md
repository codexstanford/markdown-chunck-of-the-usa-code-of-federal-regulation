### PART 3 - ADJUDICATION
#### Subpart A - Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
##### Regulations Applicable to the Improved Pension Program Which Became Effective January 1, 1979
###### ยง 3.276 Asset transfers and penalty periods.
####### Example 2.

(ii)For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit under ยง 3.274(a) is $123,600. A claimant's annual income is zero and her total assets are $125,000, which exceeds the net worth limit. In addition, the claimant transferred $30,000 by giving $20,000 to her married son and giving $10,000 to a friend. The claimant's covered asset amount is $30,000 because this is the amount by which the claimant's net worth would have exceeded the limit due to the covered assets alone.
