###### Categories of veterans eligible to be enrolled.

(b)The Secretary will determine which categories of veterans are eligible to be enrolled based on the following order of priority:

(1) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 50 percent or greater based on one or more service-connected disabilities or unemployability; and veterans awarded the Medal of Honor.

(2) Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities.

(3) Veterans who are former prisoners of war; veterans awarded the Purple Heart; veterans with a singular or combined rating of 10 percent or 20 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities; veterans who were discharged or released from active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who receive disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1151, but only to the extent that such veterans' continuing eligibility for that care is provided for in the judgment or settlement described in 38 U.S.C. 1151; veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended because of the receipt of military retired pay; and veterans receiving compensation at the 10 percent rating level based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities that clearly interfere with normal employability.

(4) Veterans who receive increased pension based on their need for regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound and other veterans who are determined to be catastrophically disabled by the Chief of Staff (or equivalent clinical official) at the VA facility where they were examined.

(5) Veterans not covered by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section who are determined to be unable to defray the expenses of necessary care under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a).

(6) Veterans of the Mexican border period or of World War I; veterans solely seeking care for a disorder associated with exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War (the period between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998), or for any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided and limited in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e); Camp Lejeune veterans pursuant to § 17.400; and veterans with 0 percent service-connected disabilities who are nevertheless compensated, including veterans receiving compensation for inactive tuberculosis.

(7) Veterans who agree to pay to the United States the applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g) if their income for the previous year constitutes "low income" under the geographical income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the fiscal year that ended on September 30 of the previous calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, VA will determine the income of veterans (to include the income of their spouses and dependents) using the rules in §§ 3.271, 3.272, 3.273, and 3.276. After determining the veterans' income and the number of persons in the veterans' family (including only the spouse and dependent children), VA will compare their income with the current applicable "low-income" income limit for the public housing and section 8 programs in their area that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development publishes pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). If the veteran's income is below the applicable "low-income" income limits for the area in which the veteran resides, the veteran will be considered to have "low income" for purposes of this paragraph. To avoid a hardship to a veteran, VA may use the projected income for the current year of the veteran, spouse, and dependent children if the projected income is below the "low income" income limit referenced above. This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories:

(i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in adocument promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;

(ii) Nonservice-connected veterans who are in an enrolled status on a specified date announced in adocument promulgated under paragraph (c) of this section and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;

(iii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; and

(iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section.

(8) Veterans not included in priority category 4 or 7, who are eligible for care only if they agree to pay to the United States the applicable copayment determined under 38 U.S.C. 1710(f) and 1710(g). This category is further prioritized into the following subcategories:

(i) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans who were in an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;

(ii) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section and whose income is not greater than ten percent more than the income that would permit their enrollment in priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is higher;

(iii) Nonservice-connected veterans who were in an enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who are moved from a higher priority category or subcategory due to no longer being eligible for inclusion in such priority category or subcategory and who subsequently do not request disenrollment;

(iv) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section and whose income is not greater than ten percent more than the income that would permit their enrollment in priority category 5 or priority category 7, whichever is higher;

(v) Noncompensable zero percent service-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(i) or paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section; and

(vi) Nonservice-connected veterans not included in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) or paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section.
