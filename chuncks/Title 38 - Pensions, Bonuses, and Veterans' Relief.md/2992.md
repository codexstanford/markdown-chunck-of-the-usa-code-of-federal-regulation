##### ยง 17.47 Considerations applicable in determining eligibility for hospital care, medical services, nursing home care, or domiciliary care.
###### disability, disease, or defect

(c) Awill comprehend any acute, subacute, or chronic disease (or a general medical, tuberculous, or neuropsychiatric type) of any acute, subacute, or chronic surgical condition susceptible of cure or decided improvement by hospital care or medical services; or any condition which does not require hospital care or medical services for an acute or chronic condition but requires domiciliary care. Domiciliary care, as the term implies, is the provision of a temporary home, with such ambulant medical care as is needed. To be provided with domiciliary care, the applicant must consistently have a disability, disease, or defect which is essentially chronic in type and is producing disablement of such degree and probable persistency as will incapacitate from earning a living for a prospective period.

(d)(1) For purposes of determining eligibility for hospital care, medical services, or nursing home care under ยง 17.47(a), a veteran will be determined unable to defray the expenses of necessary care if the veteran agrees to provide verifiable evidence, as determined by the Secretary, that:

(i) The veteran is eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act;

(ii) The veteran is in receipt of pension under 38 U.S.C. 1521; or

(iii) The veteran's attributable income does not exceed $15,000 if the veteran has no dependents, $18,000 if the veteran has one dependent, plus $1,000 for each additional dependent.

(2) For purposes of determining eligibility for hospital care, medical services, or nursing home care under ยง 17.47(c), a veteran will be determined eligible for necessary care if the veteran agrees to provide verifiable evidence, as determined by the Secretary, that: The veteran's attributable income does not exceed $20,000 if the veteran has no dependents, $25,000 if the veteran has one dependent, plus $1,000 for each additional dependent.

(3) Effective on January 1 of each year after calendar year 1986, the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be increased by the percentage by which the maximum rates of pension were increased under 38 U.S.C. 5312(a), during the preceding year.
