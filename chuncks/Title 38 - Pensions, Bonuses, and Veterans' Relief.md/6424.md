####### Estimating the duration of the training period needed.

(e)The CP or VRC, in estimating duration of the training period needed, must determine that:

(1) The proposed vocational training program must be one which, when pursued full-time by a nondisabled person, would not normally require more than 24 calendar months of pursuit for successful completion;

(2) The program of training and other services needed by the veteran, based upon VA's evaluation, will not exceed 24 calendar months, if training is pursued on a full-time basis, or 36 calendar months if pursued on a less than full-time basis. In making this determination the following criteria will be applied:

(i) The number of actual months and days of the period during which the veteran will pursue the training program will be counted;

(ii) Days of authorized leave and other periods during which the veteran will not be pursuing training, such as periods between terms will also be counted;

(iii) The period of evaluation prior to determination of reasonable feasibility will be excluded but the actual number of months and days needed to evaluate and improve rehabilitation potential during the training program will be included;

(iv) The time required, as determined in months and days under paragraph (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, will be the total period that would be required for the veteran to accomplish the vocational program under consideration;

(v) If the total period the veteran requires exceeds 24 calendar months, when pursued on a full-time basis, and an extension of the basic training period may not be approved under ยง 21.6072 of this part, another suitable vocational goal must be selected for which training can be completed within that period.

(3) If the veteran's vocational training program would require more than 36 calendar months when pursued on a less than full-time basis, the program must be reevaluated to select a vocational goal for which a suitable vocational training program can be completed within that period.
