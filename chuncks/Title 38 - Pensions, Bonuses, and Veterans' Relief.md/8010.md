In those areas where local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be required from a registered professional architect and/or registered engineer certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of the national building codes which is typical of similar construction methods and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions of the condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or repaired must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
