### PART 3 - ADJUDICATION
#### Subpart A - Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
##### Regulations Applicable to the Improved Pension Program Which Became Effective January 1, 1979
###### ยง 3.276 Asset transfers and penalty periods.
####### Example 1.

(i)For purposes of this example, presume the net worth limit under ยง 3.274(a) is $123,600. A claimant's assets total $115,900 and his annual income is zero. However, the claimant transferred $30,000 by giving it to a friend. If the claimant had not transferred the $30,000, his net worth would have been $145,900, which exceeds the net worth limit. The claimant's covered asset amount is $22,300, because this is the amount by which the claimant's net worth would have exceeded the limit due to the covered asset.
