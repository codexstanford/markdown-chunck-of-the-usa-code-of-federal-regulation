The adjusted rate will become effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of the following month.

The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of the note. For loans where the date of the note is before January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment. For loans where the date of the note is on or after January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 45 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.
