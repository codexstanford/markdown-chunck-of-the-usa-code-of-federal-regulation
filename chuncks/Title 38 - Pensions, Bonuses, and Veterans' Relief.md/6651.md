###### § 21.7072 Entitlement to basic educational assistance.
####### Entitlement: individual discharged for service-connected disability, a medical condition which preexisted service, hardship, or involuntarily for the convenience of the Government as a result of a reduction in force.

(b)(1) Except as provided in § 21.7073, when the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are met, an eligible individual is entitled to one month of basic educational assistance (or equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) for each month of the individual's continuous active duty service that is after June 30, 1985, and that, in the case of an individual who had no previous eligibility under 38 U.S.C. ch. 34, is part of the individual's qualifying obligated period of active duty. In the case of a veteran to whom the definition of continuous active duty found in either § 21.7020(b)(6)(iii) or § 21.7020(b)(6)(iv) applies, the length of the continuous active duty will be the aggregate length of the periods of active duty referred to in those paragraphs. Except as provided in § 21.7073, VA will apply paragraph (b) of this section when the individual:

(i) Establishes eligibility through meeting the eligibility requirements of § 21.7042 or § 21.7044,

(ii) Serves less than 36 months of continuous active duty service after June 30, 1985 (or less than 24 continuous months of a qualifying obligated period of active duty service after June 30, 1985, if his or her qualifying obligated period of active duty is less than 3 years), and

(iii) Is discharged or released from active duty either-

(A) For a service-connected disability, or

(B) For a medical condition which preexisted the individual's service on active duty and which VA determines is not service connected,

(C) Under 10 U.S.C. 1173 (hardship discharge), or

(D) Involuntarily for convenience of the government as a result of a reduction in force, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or;

(E) For a physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct but did interfere with the individual's performance of duty, as determined by the Secretary of each military department in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

(2) Entitlement will be calculated in whole months.

(3) The following types of time lost are not countable in determining the extent of a veteran's or servicemember's entitlement:

(i) Excess leave,

(ii) Noncreditable time, and
