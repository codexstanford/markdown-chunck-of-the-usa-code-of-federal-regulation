###### Employment of short duration.

(11)The provisions of paragraph (f)(7) of this section are similarly applicable to applicants whose employment is of short duration. Such cases will entail careful consideration of the employer's confirmation of employment, probability of permanency, past employment record, the applicant's qualifications for the position, and previous training, including that received in the military service. In the event that such considerations do not enable a determination that the income from the veteran's current position has a reasonable likelihood of continuance, such income should not be considered in the analysis. Applications received from persons employed in the building trades, or in other occupations affected by climatic conditions, should be supported by documentation evidencing the applicant's total earnings to date and covering a period of not less than 1 year as well as signed and dated copies of complete income tax returns, including all schedules for the past 2 years or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. If the applicant works out of a union, evidence of the previous year's earnings should be obtained together with a verification of employment from the current employer.
