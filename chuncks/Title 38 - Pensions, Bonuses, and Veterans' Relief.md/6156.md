####### Individuals exempt from additional active duty requirements.

(d)(1) An individual who originally enlists in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enters on active duty after October 16, 1981 (either as an enlisted member or officer), will be eligible to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 based upon the ensuing period of active duty, and is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she subsequently:

(i) Is discharged or released from active duty:

(A) Under 10 U.S.C. 1173 (hardship discharge), or

(B) Under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge), or

(C) For a disability incurred in or aggravated in line of duty; or

(ii) Is found by Department of Veterans Affairs to have a service-connected disability which gives the individual basic entitlement to disability compensation as described in ยง 3.4(b) of this chapter. Once the Department of Veterans Affairs makes this finding, the exemption will continue to apply even if the disability subsequently improves and becomes noncompensable.

(2) An individual who enters on a period of active duty after October 16, 1981, is also exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she:

(i) Previously completed a continuous period of active duty of at least 24 months, or

(ii) Was discharged or released from a previous period of active duty under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge).

(3) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the Department of Veterans Affairs will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service as specified in ยง 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.
