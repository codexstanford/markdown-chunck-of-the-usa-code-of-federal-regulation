######## ยง 3515.20 May I exchange preference rights?

Yes. To have a preference right that can be exchanged, you must have timely submitted a preference right lease application. If you have demonstrated a right to a lease, BLM may, in lieu of issuing the preference right lease, negotiate for the selection of appropriate lands to exchange and establish lease terms for those lands.
