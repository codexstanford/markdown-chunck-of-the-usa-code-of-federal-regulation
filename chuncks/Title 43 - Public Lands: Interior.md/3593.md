### Chapter I - Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior
#### PART 426 - ACREAGE LIMITATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
##### ยง 426.23 Recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.
###### Amount of O&M cost a district must pay if it amends its contract to provide supplemental or additional benefits.

(d)If a district amends its contract after October 12, 1982, to provide supplemental or additional benefits, as provided for in ยง 426.3(a)(3), then the following must be complied with:

(1) The district must pay all of the O&M costs that Reclamation allocates to irrigation;

(2) If in the year the amendment is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate and annually paid to the United States. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

(3) The district must pay any increases in the amount paid annually toward the construction costs of a project that the United States requires the district to pay as a condition of agreeing to provide the district with supplemental and additional benefits.
