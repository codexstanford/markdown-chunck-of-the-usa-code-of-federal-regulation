##### Investment

(f)in a substantial improvement refers to the basic expenditure of moneys or property in kind in connection with a particular improvement. Thus, for example, where property is conveyed by testamentary or inter vivos gift, the donee will be seen only as occupying the position of the donor with respect to the time and amount of the investment since it was the donor who made the investment.
