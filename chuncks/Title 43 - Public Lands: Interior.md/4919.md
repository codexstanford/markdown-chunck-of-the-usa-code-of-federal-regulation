######## ยง 2806.12 When and where do I pay rent?

(a) You must pay rent for the initial rental period before the BLM issues you a grant or lease.

(1) If your non-linear grant or lease is effective on:

(i) January 1 through September 30 and qualifies for annual payments, your initial rent bill is pro-rated to include only the remaining full months in the initial year; or

(ii) October 1 through December 31 and qualifies for annual payments, your initial rent bill is pro-rated to include the remaining full months in the initial year plus the next full year.

(2) If your non-linear grant allows for multi-year payments, such as a short term grant issued for energy site-specific testing, you may request that your initial rent bill be for the full term of the grant instead of the initial rent bill periods provided under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(b) You must make all rental payments for linear rights-of-way according to the payment plan described in ยง 2806.24.

(c) After the first rental payment, all rent is due on January 1 of the first year of each succeeding rental period for the term of your grant.

(d) You must make all rental payments as instructed by us or as provided for by Secretarial order or legislative authority.
