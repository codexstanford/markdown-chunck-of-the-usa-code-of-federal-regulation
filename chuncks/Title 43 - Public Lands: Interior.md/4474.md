######## Desert lands

(c)means unreclaimed lands which will not, without irrigation, produce any reasonably remunerative agricultural crop by usual means or methods of cultivation. This includes lands which will not, without irrigation, produce paying crops during a series of years, but on which crops can be successfully grown in alternate years by means of the so-called dry-farming system. Lands which produce native grasses sufficient in quantity, if ungrazed by grazing animals, to make an ordinary crop of hay in usual seasons, are not desert lands. Lands which will produce an agricultural crop of any kind without irrigation in amount sufficient to make the cultivation reasonably remunerative are not desert. Lands containing sufficient moisture to produce a natural growth of trees are not to be classed as desert lands.
