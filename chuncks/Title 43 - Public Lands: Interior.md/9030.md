######## Determination of payment in coal trespass.

(a)For coal trespass in a State where there is no State law governing such trespass, the measure of damages will be as follows:

(1) For innocent trespass, payment must be made for the value of the coal in place before severance. United States v. Homestake Mining Company (117 Fed. 481).

(2) For willful trespass, payment must be made for the full value of the coal at the time of conversion without deduction for labor bestowed or expense incurred in removing and marketing the coal. Liberty Bell Gold Mining Company v. Smuggler-Union Mining Company (203 Fed. 795). The mining of coal in trespass is presumed to be willful, in the absence of persuasive evidence of the innocence and good faith of the trespasser. United States v. Ute Coal and Coke Company (158 Fed. 20).
