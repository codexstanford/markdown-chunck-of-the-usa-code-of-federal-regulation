The BLM will prioritize your application by placing it into one of three categories and may re-categorize your application based on new information received through surveys, public meetings, or other data collection, or after any changes to the application. The BLM will generally prioritize the processing of leases awarded under subpart 2809 before applications submitted under subpart 2804.

(2) Previously disturbed sites or areas adjacent to previously disturbed or developed sites;

(3) Lands currently designated as Visual Resource Management Class IV; or

(4) Lands identified as suitable for disposal in BLM land use plans.

(b) Medium-priority applications are given priority over low-priority applications and may include lands that meet the following criteria:

(1) BLM special management areas that provide for limited development, including recreation sites and facilities;

(2) Areas where a project may adversely affect conservation lands, including lands with wilderness characteristics that have been identified in an updated wilderness characteristics inventory;

(3) Right-of-way avoidance areas;

(4) Areas where project development may adversely affect resources and properties listed nationally such as the National Register of Historic Places, National Natural Landmarks, or National Historic Landmarks;

(5) Sensitive habitat areas, including important species use areas, riparian areas, or areas of importance for Federal or State sensitive species;

(6) Lands currently designated as Visual Resource Management Class III;
