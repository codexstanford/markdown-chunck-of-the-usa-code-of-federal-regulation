######## Recoverable coal reserves estimates.

(3)For all Federal coal leases issued or readjusted after August 4, 1976, the recoverable coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves shall be those estimated by the authorized officer as of the date of approval of the resource recovery and protection plan, or the date of approval of any existing mining plan as defined at 30 CFR 740.5 (1981). If an operator/lessee credits production toward diligent development in accordance with ยง 3483.5 of this title, such credits shall be included in the recoverable coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves estimates. The estimate of recoverable coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves may only be revised as new information becomes available. Estimates of recoverable coal reserves or LMU recoverable coal reserves shall not be reduced due to any production after the original estimate made by the authorized officer.
