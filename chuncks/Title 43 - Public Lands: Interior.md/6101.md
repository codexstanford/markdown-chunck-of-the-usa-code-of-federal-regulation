####### ยง 3174.6 Oil measurement by tank gauging - procedures.
######## Determine observed oil gravity.

(4)Tests for oil gravity must comply with paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section and API 9.1, API 9.2, or API 9.3 (all incorporated by reference, see ยง 3174.3).

(i) The hydrometer or thermohydrometer (as applicable) must be calibrated for an oil gravity range that includes the observed gravity of the oil sample being tested and must be clean, with a clearly legible oil gravity scale and with no loose shot weights.

(ii) Allow the temperature to stabilize for at least 5 minutes prior to reading the thermometer.

(iii) Read and record the observed API oil gravity to the nearest 0.1 degree. Read and record the temperature reading to the nearest 1.0 &#xB0;F.
