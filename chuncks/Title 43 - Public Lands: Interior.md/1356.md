##### ยง 11.71 Quantification phase - service reduction quantification.
###### Direct quantification of services.

(f)The effects of a discharge or release on a resource may be quantified by directly measuring changes in services provided by vhe resource, instead of quantifying the changes in the resource itself, when it is determined that all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The change in the services from baseline can be demonstrated to have resulted from the injury to the natural resource;

(2) The extent of change in the services resulting from the injury can be measured without also calculating the extent of change in the resource; and

(3) The services to be measured are anticipated to provide a better indication of damages caused by the injury than would direct quantification of the injury itself.
