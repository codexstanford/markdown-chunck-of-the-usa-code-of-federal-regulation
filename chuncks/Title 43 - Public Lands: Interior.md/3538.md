###### Nonexcess land that becomes excess when acquired involuntarily.

(e)(1) Reclamation can make irrigation water available for a period of 5 years to a landowner who involuntarily acquires land that becomes excess in the involuntarily acquiring landowner's holding provided the land was nonexcess to the previous owner and:

(i) The acquiring landowner never previously held such land as ineligible excess land or under a recordable contract;

(ii) The acquiring landholder is a financial institution; or

(iii) The acquiring landowner previously held the land as ineligible excess or under a recordable contract and § 426.12(g)(1), (3), or (4) applies.

(2) The following will be applicable in situations that meet the criteria specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section:

(i) Reclamation will charge a rate for irrigation water delivered to such land equal to the rate paid by the former owner, except Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate if:

(A) The land becomes subject to full-cost pricing through leasing; or

(B) If the involuntarily acquired land is eligible to receive irrigation water only because § 426.12(g)(3) applies and the deed covenant has not expired;

(ii) The new landowner may not place such land under a recordable contract;

(iii) The new landowner may request that Reclamation remove a deed covenant as provided in § 426.12(i)(4), and may sell such land at any time without price approval and without the deed covenant. However, the deed covenant will not be removed and the terms of the deed covenant will be fully applied if the new landowner is the landowner who sold the land in question from excess status, except for:

(A) Financial institutions; or

(B) Landowners for which § 426.12(g) (1) or (2) apply; and

(iv) Such land will become ineligible to receive irrigation water 5 years after it was acquired and will remain ineligible until sold to an eligible buyer or redesignated as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.
