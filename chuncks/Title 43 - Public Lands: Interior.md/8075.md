The Mining in the Parks Act (16 U.S.C. 1901), effectively withdrew all National Parks and Monuments from location and entry under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. Since September 28, 1976, all National Parks and Monuments and other units of the National Park System have been closed to the location of mining claims and sites under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. Valid existing rights are recognized, but access and permission to operate mining claims and sites within units of the National Park System are now governed by 36 CFR part 9.
