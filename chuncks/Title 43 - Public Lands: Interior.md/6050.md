is provided not as a requirement but solely as an example to aid operators, purchasers and transporters in determining what valves are considered "appropriate valves" subject to the seal requirements of this rule, and to aid in the preparation of facility diagrams. It is impossible to include every type of equipment that could be used or situation that could occur in production activities. In making the determination of what is an "appropriate valve," the entire facility must be considered as a whole, including the facility size, the equipment type, and the on-going activities at the facility.
