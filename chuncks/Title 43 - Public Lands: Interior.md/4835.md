(b) BLM may require common use of a right-of-way and may require, to the extent practical, location of new rights-of-way within existing or designated right-of-way corridors (ยง 2802.11 of this subpart). Safety and other considerations may limit the extent to which you may share a right-of-way. BLM will designate right-of-way corridors through land use plan decisions.

(c) You should contact the BLM office nearest the lands you seek to use to:

(1) Determine whether or not the land you want to use is available for that use; and

(2) Begin discussions about any application you may need to file.
