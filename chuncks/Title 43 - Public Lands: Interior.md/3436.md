###### The effect on a landholder's status when a district becomes subject to the discretionary provisions.

(e)If a district conforms to the discretionary provisions and the landholder is:

(1) Other than a nonresident alien or a legal entity that is not established under State or Federal law, and is:

(i) A direct landholder in that district, then the landholder becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the associated acreage limitation status will apply in any district in which the landholder holds land; or

(ii) Only an indirect landholder in that and all other discretionary provisions districts, then the landholder's acreage limitation status is not affected. Such a landholder can receive irrigation water as a prior law recipient on indirectly held lands in districts that conform to the discretionary provisions.

(2) A nonresident alien, or legal entity not established under State or Federal law, and the landholder is:

(i) A direct landholder, then since such a landholder cannot become subject to, and has no eligibility under the discretionary provisions:

(A) All direct landholdings in districts that conform to the discretionary provisions become ineligible; and

(B) Directly held land that becomes ineligible as a result of the district's action to conform to the discretionary provisions may be placed under recordable contract as subject to the conditions specified in ยง 426.12; or

(ii) An indirect landholder, then such a landholder may receive irrigation water on land indirectly held in districts conforming to the discretionary provisions, with the entitlements for such landholder determined as specified in ยง 426.8.
