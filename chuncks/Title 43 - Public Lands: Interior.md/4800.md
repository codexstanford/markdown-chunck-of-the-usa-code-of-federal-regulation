######## Megawatt (MW) capacity fee

means the fee paid in addition to the acreage rent for solar and wind energy development grants and leases. The MW capacity fee is the approved MW capacity of the solar or wind energy grant or lease multiplied by the appropriate MW rate. A grant or lease may provide for stages of development, and the grantee or lessee will be charged a fee for each stage by multiplying the MW rate by the approved MW capacity for the stage of the project.
