### Chapter I - Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior
#### PART 426 - ACREAGE LIMITATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
##### ยง 426.23 Recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.
###### Amount of O&M that Reclamation charges an irrevocable elector.

(f)(1) Regardless of any terms to the contrary within a prior contract with a district, a landholder who makes an irrevocable election, as provided for in ยง 426.3(f) must pay, annually, his or her proportionate share of all O&M costs allocated by Reclamation to irrigation. The irrevocable elector's proportionate share is based upon the ratio of:

(i) The amount of land in the district held by the irrevocable elector that received irrigation water to the total amount of land in the district that received irrigation water; or

(ii) The amount of irrigation water in the district received by the irrevocable elector to the total amount of irrigation water that the district delivered.

(2) The district(s) where the irrevocable elector's landholding is located must collect from the irrevocable elector an amount equal to the irrevocable elector's proportionate share of all O&M costs allocated by Reclamation to irrigation and the following apply:

(i) If in the year the election is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year, then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

(ii) Such collections must be forwarded annually to the United States.
