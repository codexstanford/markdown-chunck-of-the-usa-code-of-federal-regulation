The obligation to pay royalty for production attributable to unleased Federal lands accrues from the later of the date the-

(2) Previously leased tracts within the participating area become unleased.

(b) The royalty rate applicable to production allocated to unleased Federal lands is the greater of 12percent or the highest royalty rate for any lease committed to the unit.

(c) The value of the production must be determined under the Minerals Management Service's oil and gas product value regulations at 30 CFR part 206.
