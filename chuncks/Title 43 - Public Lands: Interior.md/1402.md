###### Double counting.

(c)(1) Double counting of damages should be avoided. Double counting means that a benefit or cost has been counted more than once in the damage assessment.

(2) Natural resource damages are the residual to be determined by incorporating the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions. To avoid one aspect of double counting, the effects of response actions shall be factored into the analysis of damages. If response actions will not be completed until after the assessment has been initiated, the anticipated effects of such actions should be included in the assessment.
