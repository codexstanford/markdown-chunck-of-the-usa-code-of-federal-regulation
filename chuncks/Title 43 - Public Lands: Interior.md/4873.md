####### ยง 2804.25 How will BLM process my application?
######## e.g.

(iii) Evaluate the application based on the information provided by the applicant and input from other parties, such as Federal, State, and local government agencies, and tribes, as well as comments received in preliminary application review meetings held under ยง 2804.12(b)(4) and the public meeting held under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. The BLM will also evaluate your application based on whether you propose to site the development appropriately (outside of a designated leasing area or exclusion area) and whether you address known resource values discussed in the preliminary application review meetings. Based on these evaluations, the BLM will either deny your application or continue processing it.

(3) Determine whether a POD schedule submitted with your application meets the development schedule or other requirements described by the BLM, such as in ยง 2804.12(b);

(4) Complete appropriate National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance for the application, as required by 43 CFR part 46 and 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508;

(5) Determine whether your proposed use complies with applicable Federal and State laws;

(6) If your application is for a road, determine whether it is in the public interest to require you to grant the United States an equivalent authorization across lands that you own;

(7) Consult, as necessary, on a government-to-government basis with tribes and other governmental entities; and

(8) Take any other action necessary to fully evaluate and decide whether to approve or deny your application.
