####### ยง 3170.3 Definitions and acronyms.
######## Facility measurement point (FMP)

means a BLM-approved point where oil or gas produced from a Federal or Indian lease, unit PA, or CA is measured and the measurement affects the calculation of the volume or quality of production on which royalty is owed. FMP includes, but is not limited to, the approved point of royalty measurement and measurement points relevant to determining the allocation of production to Federal or Indian leases, unit PAs, or CAs. However, allocation facilities that are part of a commingling and allocation approval under ยง 3173.15 or that are part of a commingling and allocation approval approved after July 9, 2013, are not FMPs. An FMP also includes a meter or measurement facility used in the determination of the volume or quality of royalty-bearing oil or gas produced before BLM approval of an FMP under ยง 3173.12. An FMP must be located on the lease, unit, or communitized area unless the BLM approves measurement off the lease, unit, or CA. The BLM will not approve a gas processing plant tailgate meter located off the lease, unit, or CA, as an FMP.
