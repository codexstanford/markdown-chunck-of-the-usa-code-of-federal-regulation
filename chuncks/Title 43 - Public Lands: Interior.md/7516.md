######## ยง 3513.12 What criteria does BLM consider in approving a waiver, suspension, or reduction in rental or minimum royalty, or a reduction in the royalty rate?

We will consider if approval:

(a) Is in the interest of conservation;

(b) Will encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of the resource; and

(c) Is necessary either to promote development of the mineral resources or because you cannot successfully operate the lease under existing terms.
