######## To enlarge area of desert-land entry.

(a)Amendment for the purpose of enlarging the area of a desert-land entry will be granted under and in the conditions and circumstances now to be stated.

(1) In any case where it is satisfactorily disclosed that entry was not made to embrace the full area which might lawfully have been included therein because of existing appropriations of all contiguous lands then appearing to be susceptible of irrigation through and by means of entryman's water supply, or of all such lands which seemed to be worthy of the expenditure requisite for that purpose, said lands having since been released from such appropriations.

(2) Where contiguous tracts have been omitted from entry because of entryman's belief, after a reasonably careful investigation, that they could not be reclaimed by means of the water supply available for use in that behalf, it having been subsequently discovered that reclamation thereof can be effectively accomplished by means of a changed plan or method of conserving or distributing such water supply.

(3) Where, at the time of entry, the entryman announced, in his declaration, his purpose to procure the cancellation, through contest or relinquishment, of an entry embracing lands contiguous to those entered by him, and thereafter to seek amendment of his entry in such manner as to embrace all or some portion of the lands so discharged from entry.
