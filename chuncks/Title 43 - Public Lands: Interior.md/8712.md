(a) Does BLM charge an adoption fee for wild horses and burros?

You must pay an adoption fee for each wild horse or burro you adopt. Usually BLM will charge you a $125 base fee. BLM will not charge you an adoption fee for orphan foals.

(b) Can BLM increase the adoption fee?

Yes, BLM may increase the adoption fee. BLM may hold competitive adoption events for wild horses or burros. At competitive adoptions, qualified adopters set adoption fees through competitive bidding. For these adoptions, the fee is the highest bid received over the base fee of $125. Horses or burros remaining at the end of a competitive adoption event will be available for adoption at the established adoption fee.

(c) May BLM reduce or waive the adoption fee?

(1) The BLM Director may reduce or waive the fee when wild horses or burros are un-adoptable at the base adoption fee.

(2) A reduction or waiver of the adoption fee is available only if you are willing to comply with all regulations relating to wild horses and burros.
