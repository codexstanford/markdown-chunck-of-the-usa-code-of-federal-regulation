###### Changes in the Size of the Permit Area
####### ยง 4300.54 Can BLM increase the size of the land in my permit?

Yes. BLM may increase the area on its own initiative or by your request if BLM determines that the area is too small for the number of reindeer you are grazing. BLM will give you at least 30 days' notice of this action.
