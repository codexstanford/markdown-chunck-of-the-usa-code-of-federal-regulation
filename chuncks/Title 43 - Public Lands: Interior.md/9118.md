###### Reallocation of funds.

(b)Section 301(f)(2) provides for the reallocation of Section 8 funds if the Commission determines "after public involvement and agency consultation * * * that the benefits to fish, wildlife, or recreation will be better served by allocating such funds in a different manner." Such reallocation requires the approval of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if funds are to be reallocated from fish and wildlife purposes to recreation purposes. The Commission's authority to depart from the mitigation and conservation schedule specified in Section 315 of the Act is reiterated in Section 301(h)(1).
