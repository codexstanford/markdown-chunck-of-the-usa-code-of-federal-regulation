######### Per acre zone rate.

(1)The annual per acre zone rate from the wind energy acreage rent schedule is calculated using the per acre zone value (as assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section), encumbrance factor, rate of return, and the annual adjustment factor. The calculation for determining the annual per acre zone rate is A x B x C x D = E where:

(i) A is the per acre zone value = the same per- acre zone values described in the linear rent schedule in ยง 2806.20(c);

(ii) B is the encumbrance factor = 10 percent;

(iii) C is the rate of return = 5.27 percent;

(iv) D is the annual adjustment factor = the average annual change in the IPD-GDP for the 10-year period immediately preceding the year that the NASS Census data becomes available (see ยง 2806.22(a)). The BLM will adjust the per acre rates each year based on the average annual change in the IPD-GDP as determined under ยง 2806.22(a). Adjusted rates are effective each year on January 1; and

(v) E is the annual per acre zone rate.
