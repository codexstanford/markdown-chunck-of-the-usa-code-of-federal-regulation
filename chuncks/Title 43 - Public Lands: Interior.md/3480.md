###### Application of full-cost rate to land held by grantor revocable trusts.

(d)If a grantor revocable trust that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is revised by the grantor in a manner that precludes attribution of the land held in trust to the grantor:

(1) Before April 20, 1988, Reclamation will not assess full-cost rates for the land held by the revised trust for the period before it was revised; or

(2) On or after April 20, 1988, Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any land held by the trust that exceeds the grantor's nonfull-cost entitlement, commencing December 23, 1987, until the trust agreement is revised to make it an irrevocable trust or an otherwise revocable trust.
