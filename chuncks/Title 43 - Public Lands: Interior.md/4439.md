######## ยง 2569.405 What are the special provisions that apply to selections that include State or Native corporation selected land?
######### https://www.blm.gov/alaska/2019AKNativeVetsLand.

(a) If the selection you are applying for includes State or Native corporation selected land, the BLM must receive a valid relinquishment from the State or Native corporation that covers all of the lands in your selection that are State or Native corporation selected lands. If the application does not include a valid relinquishment, the BLM will contact the State or Native corporation to request a relinquishment. This requirement does not apply if all of the State or Native corporation selected land included within your selection consists of land for which the State or Native corporation has issued a blanket conditional relinquishment as shown on the mapping tool available at

(b) No such relinquishment may cause a Native corporation to become underselected. See 43 U.S.C. 1621(j)(2) for a definition of underselection.

(c) An application for Native corporation or State selected land will segregate the land from any future entries on the land once the BLM receives a valid relinquishment.

(d) If the State or Native corporation is unable or unwilling to provide a valid relinquishment, the BLM will issue a decision finding that your selection includes lands that are not available Federal lands and then follow the procedures set out at ยง 2569.503.
