####### ยง 3174.10 Coriolis meter for LACT and CMS measurement applications - operating requirements.
######## e.g.,

(ii) The effect of changes in temperature and pressure on both mass flow and fluid density readings, and the effect of flow rate on density readings. These specifications must be stated in percent of reading, percent of full scale, or units of measure over a stated amount of change in temperature, pressure, or flow rate ("+/-0.1 percent of reading per 20 psi");

(iii) The stability of the zero reading for volumetric flow rate. The specifications must be stated in percent of reading, percent of full scale, or units of measure;

(iv) Design limits for flow rate and pressure; and

(v) Pressure drop through the meter as a function of flow rate and fluid viscosity.

(2) Submission of meter specifications: The operator must submit Coriolis meter specifications to the BLM upon request.
