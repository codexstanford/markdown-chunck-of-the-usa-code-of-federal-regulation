(f)For purposes of determining eligibility, the entire landholding will be attributed to all the direct and indirect landholders. If the interests in a legal entity are:

(1) Undivided, then all of the indirect part owners must be eligible in order for the entity to be eligible; or

(2) Divided, in such a manner that specific parcels are attributable to each indirect landholder, then the entity may qualify for eligibility on those portions of the landholding not attributable to any part owner who is ineligible.
