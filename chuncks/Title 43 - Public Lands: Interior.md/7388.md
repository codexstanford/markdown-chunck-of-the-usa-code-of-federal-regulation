######### Appeal.

(c)If a surface management agency refuses to consent or imposes conditions on your permit or lease, you may appeal its decision under that agency's appeal provisions. If you notify BLM within 30 days after receiving BLM's decision denying or conditioning your permit or lease that you have appealed the surface management agency's decision, we will suspend the time for filing an appeal under 43 CFR parts 4 and 1840 until the surface management agency's decision is final and not subject to further administrative or judicial review.
