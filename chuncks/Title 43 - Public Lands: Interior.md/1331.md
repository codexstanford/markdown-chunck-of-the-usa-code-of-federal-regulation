###### Air pathway.

(d)(1) When air resources are suspected as the pathway or a component of the pathway, the authorized official shall determine, using guidance provided in this paragraph, whether the air resources either solely or in combination with other media, served as the exposure pathway for injury to the resource.

(2) Using available information, air modeling, and additional field sampling and analysis, it should be determined whether air resources have been exposed to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.

(3)(i) If an air resource is or has likely been exposed, available information and such additional tests as necessary should be used to estimate the areal extent of exposure and the duration and frequency of exposure of such areas to emissions from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.

(ii) The areal extent of exposure is defined as the geographical surface area or space where emissions from the source of discharge or release are found or otherwise determined to be present for such duration and frequency as to potentially result in injury to resources present within the area or space.

(4) Previous studies of the characteristics discussed in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section should be relied upon if the conditions in the exposed air resource are similar to experimental conditions of the previous studies. In the absence of this information, air sampling and analysis methods identified in ยง 11.64(d) of this part, air modeling methods, or a combination of these methods may be used in identifying the air exposure pathway and in estimating the areal extent of exposure and duration and frequency of exposure.

(5) For estimating the areal extent, duration, and frequency of exposure from the discharge or release, the following factors shall be considered as may be appropriate for each emissions event:

(i) The manner and nature in which the discharge or release occurs, including the duration of the emissions, amount of the discharge or release, and emergency or other time critical factors;

(ii) The configuration of the emitting source, including sources such as ponds, lagoons, pools, puddles, land and water surface spills, and venting from containers and vessels;

(iii) Physical and chemical properties of substances discharged or released, including volatility, toxicity, solubility, and physical state;

(iv) The deposition from the air and re-emission to the air of gaseous and particulate emissions that provide periodic transport of the emissions; and

(v) Air transport and dispersion factors, including wind speed and direction, and atmospheric stability and temperature.
