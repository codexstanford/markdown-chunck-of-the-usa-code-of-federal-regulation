###### Surface water resources.

(b)(1) An injury to a surface water resource has resulted from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance if one or more of the following changes in the physical or chemical quality of the resource is measured:

(i) Concentrations and duration of substances in excess of drinking water standards as established by sections 1411-1416 of SDWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such standards for drinking water, in surface water that was potable before the discharge or release;

(ii) Concentrations and duration of substances in excess of water quality criteria established by section 1401(1)(D) of SDWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such criteria for public water supplies, in surface water that before the discharge or release met the criteria and is a committed use, as the phrase is used in this part, as a public water supply;

(iii) Concentrations and duration of substances in excess of applicable water quality criteria established by section 304(a)(1) of the CWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such criteria, in surface water that before the discharge or release met the criteria and is a committed use, as that phrase is used in this part, as a habitat for aquatic life, water supply, or recreation. The most stringent criterion shall apply when surface water is used for more than one of these purposes;

(iv) Concentrations of substances on bed, bank, or shoreline sediments sufficient to cause the sediment to exhibit characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921; or

(v) Concentrations and duration of substances sufficient to have caused injury as defined in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section to ground water, air, geologic, or biological resources, when exposed to surface water, suspended sediments, or bed, bank, or shoreline sediments.

(2)(i) The acceptance criterion for injury to the surface water resource is the measurement of concentrations of oil or a hazardous substance in two samples from the resource. The samples must be one of the following types, except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section:

(A) Two water samples from different locations, separated by a straight-line distance of not less than 100 feet; or

(B) Two bed, bank, or shoreline sediment samples from different locations separated by a straight-line distance of not less than 100 feet; or

(C) One water sample and one bed, bank, or shoreline sediment sample; or

(D) Two water samples from the same location collected at different times.

(ii) In those instances when injury is determined and no oil or hazardous substances are detected in samples from the surface water resource, it must be demonstrated that the substance causing injury occurs or has occurred in the surface water resource as a result of physical, chemical, or biological reactions initiated by the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.

(3) If the maximum straight-line distance of the surface water resource is less than 100 feet, then the samples required in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section should be separated by one-half the maximum straight-line distance of the surface water resource.
