####### ยง 3273.10 When do I need a site license for a utilization facility?

You must obtain a site license approved by BLM, unless your facility will be located on lands leased as described in ยง 3273.11. Do not start building or testing your utilization facility on public lands leased for geothermal resources until BLM has approved both your facility construction permit (see ยง 3272.14) and your site license. The facility operator must apply for the license.
