######## Vibration effects.

(f)(1) An initial resonance test must be conducted by applying the following test vibrations to the transducer along each of the three major axes of the transducer while measuring the output of the transducer with no pressure applied:

(i) The amplitude of the applied test frequency must be at least 0.35mm below 60 Hertz (Hz) and 49 meter per second squared (m/s) above 60 Hz; and

(ii) The applied frequency must be swept from 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz at a rate not greater than 0.5 octaves per minute.

(2) After the initial resonance search, an endurance conditioning test must be conducted as follows:

(i) Twenty frequency sweeps from 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz to 10 Hz must be applied to the transducer at a rate of 1 octave per minute, repeated for each of the 3 major axes; and

(ii) The measurement of the transducer's output during this test is unnecessary.

(3) A final resonance test must be conducted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
