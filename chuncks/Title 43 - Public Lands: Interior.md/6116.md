####### § 3174.8 LACT system - components and operating requirements.
######## LACT system operating requirements.

(b)Operation of all LACT system components must meet the requirements of API 6.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3) and the following:

(1) Sampling must be conducted according to API 8.2 and API 8.3 (both incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3) and the following:

(i) The sample extractor probe must be inserted within the center half of the flowing stream;

(ii) The extractor probe must be horizontally oriented; and

(iii) The external body of the extractor probe must be marked with the direction of the flow.

(2) Any tests conducted on oil samples extracted from LACT system samplers for determination of oil gravity and S&W content must meet the requirements of either API 9.1, API 9.2, or API 9.3, and API 10.4 (all incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3).

(3) The composite sample container must be emptied and cleaned upon completion of sample withdrawal.

(4) The positive displacement or Coriolis meter (see § 3174.10) must be equipped with a non-resettable totalizer. The meter must include or allow for the attachment of a device that generates at least 8,400 pulses per barrel of registered volume.

(5) The system must have a pressure-indicating device downstream of the meter, but upstream of meter-proving connections. The pressure-indicating device must be capable of providing pressure data to calculate the CPL correction factor.

(6) An electronic temperature averaging device must be installed, operated, and maintained as follows:

(i) The temperature sensor must be placed in compliance with API 7 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3);

(ii) The electronic temperature averaging device must be volume-weighted and take a temperature reading following API 21.2, Subsection 9.2.8 (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3);

(iii) The average temperature for the measurement ticket must be calculated by the volumetric averaging method using API 21.2, Subsection 9.2.13.2a (incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3);

(iv) The temperature averaging device must have a reference accuracy of +/-0.5 &#xB0;F or better, and have a minimum graduation of 0.1 &#xB0;F; and

(v) The temperature averaging device must include a display of instantaneous temperature and the average temperature calculated since the measurement ticket was opened.

(vi) The average temperature calculated since the measurement ticket was opened must be used to calculate the CTL correction factor.

(7) Determination of net standard volume: Calculate the net standard volume at the close of each measurement ticket following the guidelines in API 12.2.1 and API 12.2.2 (both incorporated by reference, see § 3174.3).
