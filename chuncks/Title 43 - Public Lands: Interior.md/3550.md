###### Temporary supplies of water.

(d)If Reclamation announces availability of temporary supplies of water resulting from an unusually large water supply, not otherwise storable for project purposes, or from infrequent and otherwise unmanaged floodflows of short duration a district may request that Reclamation make such supplies available to excess land. However, such water deliveries must not have an adverse effect on other authorized project purposes. Upon approval of the district's request, Reclamation will notify the requesting district of the availability of the temporary supply of water under the following conditions:

(1) The contract for the temporary supply of water will be for 1 year or less in accordance with prior policies and practices;

(2) The acreage limitation provisions will not be applicable to the temporary supply of water;

(3) An applicable price for the water, if any, will be established; and

(4) Such other conditions as Reclamation may include.
