######## Economically marginal property

means a lease, unit PA, or CA that does not generate sufficient revenue above operating costs, such that a prudent operator would opt to plug a well or shut-in the lease, unit PA, or CA instead of making the investments needed to achieve non-commingled measurement of production from that lease, unit PA, or CA. A lease, unit PA, or CA may be regarded as economically marginal if the operator demonstrates that the expected revenue (net any associated operating costs) generated from crude oil or natural gas production volumes on that property is not sufficient to cover the nominal cost of the capital expenditures required to achieve measurement of non-commingled production of oil or gas from that property over a payout period of 18 months. A lease, unit PA, or CA can also be considered economically marginal if the operator demonstrates that its royalty net present value (RNPV), or the discounted value of the Federal or Indian royalties collected on revenue earned from crude oil or natural gas production on the lease, unit PA, or CA, over the expected life of the equipment that would need to be installed to achieve non-commingled measurement volumes, is less than the capital cost of purchasing and installing this equipment. Both the payout period and the RNPV are determined separately for each lease, unit PA, or CA oil or gas FMP. Additionally, oil FMPs are evaluated using estimated revenue (net of taxes and operating costs) from crude oil production, as defined in this section, while gas FMPs are evaluated using estimated revenue (net of taxes and operating costs) from natural gas production, as defined in this section.
