####### § 2805.10 How will I know whether the BLM has approved or denied my application or if my bid for a solar or wind energy development grant or lease is successful or unsuccessful?

(a) The BLM will send you a written response when it has made a decision on your application or if you are the successful bidder for a solar or wind energy development grant or lease. If we approve your application, we will send you an unsigned grant for your review and signature.
