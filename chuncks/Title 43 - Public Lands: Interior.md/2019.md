###### Restricted property

means real property whose title is held by an Indian but which cannot be alienated or encumbered without the consent of the Secretary. For the purposes of probate proceedings, restricted property is treated as if it were trust property. Except as the law may provide otherwise, the term "restricted property" as used in this part does not include the restricted lands of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma or the Osage Nation.
