(1) Environmental Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments previously prepared for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321-4361, similar documents prepared under other Federal and State laws, and background studies done for any of these documents;

(2) Standard scientific and management literature sources appropriate to the resource;

(3) Computerized data bases for the resource in question;

(4) Public or private landholders in the assessment area or in neighboring areas;

(5) Studies conducted or sponsored by natural resource trustees for the resource in question;

(6) Federally sponsored research identified by the National Technical Information Service;

(7) Studies carried out by educational institutions; and

(8) Other similar sources of data.
