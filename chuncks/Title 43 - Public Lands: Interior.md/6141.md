###### Subpart 3174 - Measurement of Oil
####### ยง 3174.11 Meter-proving requirements.
######## Density verification (if applicable).

(h)As part of each required meter proving, if the API gravity of oil is determined from the average density measured by the Coriolis meter (rather than from a composite sample), then during each proving of the Coriolis meter, the instantaneous flowing density determined by the Coriolis meter must be verified by comparing it with an independent density measurement as specified under API 5.6, Subsection 9.1.2.1 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3174.3). The difference between the indicated density determined from the Coriolis meter and the independently determined density must be within the specified density reference accuracy specification of the Coriolis meter. Sampling must be performed in accordance with API 8.1, API 8.2, or API 8.3 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3174.3), as appropriate.
