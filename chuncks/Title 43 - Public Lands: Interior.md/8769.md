(a) All sales other than those specified in ยง 5402.0-6 shall be made only after inviting competitive bids through publication and posting.

Competitive sales shall be offered by the authorized officer when access to the sale area is available to anyone who is qualified to bid. Further, timber or other vegetative resources that would normally be sold by negotiated sale because of lack of legal access may be sold competitively without access if the authorized officer determines that there is competitive interest in such a sale.

(b) All competitive sales shall be subject to the restrictions relating to the export and substitution from the United States of unprocessed timber.
