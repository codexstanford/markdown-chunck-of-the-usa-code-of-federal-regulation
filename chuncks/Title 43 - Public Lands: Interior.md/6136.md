######## e.g.,

(ii) The metering system may apply a dynamic meter factor derived (using,linear interpolation, polynomial fit, etc.) from the series of meter factors determined over the range of normal operating conditions, so long as no two neighboring meter factors differ by more than 0.0020.

(7) The meter factor must be at least 0.9900 and no more than 1.0100.

(8) The initial meter factor for a new or repaired meter must be at least 0.9950 and no more than 1.0050.

(9) For positive displacement meters, the back pressure valve may be adjusted after proving only within the normal operating fluid flow rate and fluid pressure as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the back pressure valve is adjusted after proving, the operator must document the as left fluid flow rate and fluid pressure on the proving report.

(10) If a composite meter factor is calculated, the CPL value must be calculated from the pressure setting of the back pressure valve or the normal operating pressure at the meter. Composite meter factors must not be used with a Coriolis meter.
