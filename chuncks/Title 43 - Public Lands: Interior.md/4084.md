The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 377), as amended, governs the disposal of surplus Federal lands or interests in lands. Section 3 of that Act (40 U.S.C. 472), as amended, February 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 29), excepts from its provisions the following:

(a) The public domain.

(b) Lands reserved or dedicated for national forest or national park purposes.

(c) Minerals in lands or portions of lands withdrawn or reserved from the public domain which the Secretary of the Interior determines are suitable for disposition under the public land mining and mineral leasing laws.

(d) Lands withdrawn or reserved from the public domain, but not including lands or portions of lands so withdrawn or reserved which the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the General Services Administration, determines are not suitable for return to the public domain for disposition under the general public-land laws, because such lands are substantially changed in character by improvements or otherwise.
