####### ยง 2885.22 How may I make rental payments when land encumbered by my term or perpetual linear grant is being transferred out of Federal ownership?
######## Term Grant.

(d)If the land your grant encumbers is being transferred out of Federal ownership, you may pay in advance the total rent amount for the entire term of the grant or any remaining years. The BLM will use the annual rent calculated from the Per Acre Rent Schedule multiplied by the number of years in the rent payment period (the length of time for which the holder is paying rent) to determine the one-time rent. However, this amount must not exceed the one-time rent payment for a perpetual grant as determined under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
