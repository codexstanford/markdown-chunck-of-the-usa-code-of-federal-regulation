###### Ground water resources.

(c)(1) An injury to the ground water resource has resulted from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance if one or more of the following changes in the physical or chemical quality of the resource is measured:

(i) Concentrations of substances in excess of drinking water standards, established by sections 1411-1416 of the SDWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such standards for drinking water, in ground water that was potable before the discharge or release;

(ii) Concentrations of substances in excess of water quality criteria, established by section 1401(1)(d) of the SDWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such criteria for public water supplies, in ground water that before the discharge or release met the criteria and is a committed use, as the phrase is used in this part, as a public water supply;

(iii) Concentrations of substances in excess of applicable water quality criteria, established by section 304(a)(1) of the CWA, or by other Federal or State laws or regulations that establish such criteria for domestic water supplies, in ground water that before the discharge or release met the criteria and is a committed use as that phrase is used in this part, as a domestic water supply; or

(iv) Concentrations of substances sufficient to have caused injury as defined in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), or (f) of this section to surface water, air, geologic, or biological resources, when exposed to ground water.

(2) The acceptance criterion for injury to ground water resources is the measurement of concentrations of oil or hazardous substance in two ground water samples. The water samples must be from the same geohydrologic unit and must be obtained from one of the following pairs of sources, except as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section:

(i) Two properly constructed wells separated by a straight-line distance of not less than 100 feet; or

(ii) A properly constructed well and a natural spring or seep separated by a straight-line distance of not less than 100 feet; or

(iii) Two natural springs or seeps separated by a straight-line distance of not less than 100 feet.

(3) If the maximum straight-line distance of the ground water resource is less than 100 feet, the samples required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section should be separated by one-half of the maximum straight-line distance of the ground water resource.

(4) In those instances when injury is determined and no oil or hazardous substance is detected in samples from the ground water resource, it must be demonstrated that the substance causing injury occurs or has occurred in the ground water resource as a result of physical, chemical, or biological reactions initiated by the discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances.
