######## i.e.,

(h) To complete a change in name only, (when the name change in question is not the result of an underlying change in control of the right-of-way grant), the following requirements must be met:

(1) The holder must file an application requesting a name change and follow the same procedures as for a new grant, including paying processing fees. However, the application fees (see subpart 2804 of this part) and the preliminary application review and public meetings (see §§ 2804.12 and 2804.25) are not required. The name change request must include:

(i) If the name change is for an individual, a copy of the court order or other legal document effectuating the name change; or

(ii) If the name change is for a corporation, a copy of the corporate resolution(s) proposing and approving the name change, a copy of the acceptance of the change in name by the State or Territory in which it is incorporated, and a copy of the appropriate resolution, order or other documentation showing the name change.

(2) When reviewing a proposed name change only, we may determine it is necessary to:

(i) Modify a grant issued under subpart 2804 to add bonding and other requirements, including additional terms and conditions to the grant; or

(ii) Modify a lease issued under subpart 2809 in accordance with § 2805.15(e).

(3) Your name change is not recognized until the BLM approves it in writing.
