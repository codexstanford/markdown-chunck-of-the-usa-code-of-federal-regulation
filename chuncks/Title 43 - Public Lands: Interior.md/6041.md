####### ยง 3173.22 Requirements for off-lease measurement.

The BLM will consider granting a request for off-lease measurement if the request:

(a) Involves only production from a single lease, unit PA, CA, or CAA;

(b) Provides for accurate production accountability;

(c) Is in the public interest (considering factors such as BMPs, topographic and environmental conditions that make on-lease measurement physically impractical, and maximum ultimate economic recovery); and

(d) Occurs at an approved FMP. A request for approval of an FMP (see ยง 3173.12) may be filed concurrently with the request for off-lease measurement.
