### PART 10 - NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION REGULATIONS
#### Subpart D - General
##### ยง 10.15 Limitations and remedies.
###### Exhaustion of remedies.

(c)(1) A person's administrative remedies are exhausted only when the person has filed a written claim with the responsible Federal agency and the claim has been duly denied under this part. This paragraph applies to both:

(i) Human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony subject to Subpart B of this part; and

(ii) Federal collections subject to Subpart C of this part.

(2) A Federal agency's final denial of a repatriation request constitutes a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704). As used in this paragraph, "repatriation request" means the request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization for repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony brought under the Act and this part.
