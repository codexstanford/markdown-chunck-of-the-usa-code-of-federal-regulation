####### ยง 2805.20 Bonding requirements.

If you hold a grant or lease under this part, you must comply with the following bonding requirements:

(a) The BLM may require that you obtain, or certify that you have obtained, a performance and reclamation bond or other acceptable bond instrument to cover any losses, damages, or injury to human health, the environment, or property in connection with your use and occupancy of the right-of-way, including costs associated with terminating the grant, and to secure all obligations imposed by the grant and applicable laws and regulations. If you plan to use hazardous materials in the operation of your grant, you must provide a bond that covers liability for damages or injuries resulting from releases or discharges of hazardous materials. The BLM will periodically review your bond for adequacy and may require a new bond, an increase or decrease in the value of an existing bond, or other acceptable security at any time during the term of the grant or lease.

(1) The BLM must be listed as an additionally named insured on the bond instrument if a State regulatory authority requires a bond to cover some portion of environmental liabilities, such as hazardous material damages or releases, reclamation, or other requirements for the project. The bond must:

(i) Be redeemable by the BLM;

(ii) Be held or approved by a State agency for the same reclamation requirements as specified by our right-of-way authorization; and

(iii) Provide the same or greater financial guarantee that we require for the portion of environmental liabilities covered by the State's bond.
