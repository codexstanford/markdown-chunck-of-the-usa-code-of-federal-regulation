###### Reduced avian reproduction.

(B)Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the mean number of young fledged per active nest when comparing samples from populations in the assessment area and a control area. The fledging success (the number of healthy young leaving the nest) shall be used as the measurement of injury. Factors that may contribute to this measurement include egg fertility, hatching success, and survival of young. This biological response may be used when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have reduced the nesting success of avian species.
