######## Judicial review.

(f)Any person who is aggrieved by a final order of the Secretary under this section may seek review of such order in the United States District Court for the judicial district in which the alleged violation occurred. Because section 109 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act provides for judicial review of civil penalty determinations only where a person has requested a hearing on the record, a waiver of such hearing precludes further review by the district court. Review by the district court shall be on the administrative record only and not de novo. Such an action shall be barred unless filed within 90 days after issuance of final decision as provided in ยง 4.21 of this title.
