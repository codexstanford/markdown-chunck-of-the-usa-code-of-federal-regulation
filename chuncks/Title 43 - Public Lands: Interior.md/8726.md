###### ยง 5040.1 Under what authority does BLM establish sustained-yield forest units?
####### et seq.

BLM is authorized, under the O. and C. Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1181a) and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, to divide the lands it manages in western Oregon into sustained-yield forest units. These lands are hereafter referred to as "the O. and C. lands." BLM establishes units that contain enough forest land to provide, insofar as practicable, a permanent source of raw materials to support local communities and industries, giving due consideration to established forest products operations.
