##### ยง 11.71 Quantification phase - service reduction quantification.
###### Steps.

(b)Except as provided in ยง 11.71(f) of this part, the following steps are necessary to quantify the effects:

(1) Measure the extent to which the injury demonstrated in the Injury Determination phase has occurred in the assessment area;

(2) Measure the extent to which the injured resource differs from baseline conditions, as described in ยง 11.72 of this part, to determine the change attributable to the discharge or release;

(3) Determine the services normally produced by the injured resource, which are considered the baseline services or the without-a-discharge-or-release condition as described in ยง 11.72 of this part;

(4) Identify interdependent services to avoid double counting in the Damage Determination phase and to discover significant secondary services that may have been disrupted by the injury; and

(5) Measure the disruption of services resulting from the discharge or release, which is considered the change in services or the with-a-discharge-or-release condition.
