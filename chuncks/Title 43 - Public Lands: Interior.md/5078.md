###### Subpart 2809 - Competitive Process for Leasing Public Lands for Solar and Wind Energy Development Inside Designated Leasing Areas
####### § 2809.19 Applications in designated leasing areas or on lands that later become designated leasing areas.

(a) Applications for solar or wind energy development filed on lands outside of designated leasing areas, which subsequently become designated leasing areas will:

(1) Continue to be processed by the BLM and are not subject to the competitive leasing offer process of this subpart, if such applications are filed prior to the publication of the notice of intent or other public announcement from the BLM of the proposed land use plan amendment to designate the solar or wind leasing area; or

(2) Remain in pending status unless withdrawn by the applicant, denied, or issued a grant by the BLM, or the subject lands become available for application or leasing under this part, if such applications are filed on or after the date of publication of the notice of intent or other public announcement from the BLM of the proposed land use plan amendment to designate the solar or wind leasing area.

(3) Resume being processed by the BLM if your application is pending under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the lands become available for application under § 2809.17(d)(2).

(b) An applicant that submits a bid on a parcel of land for which an application is pending under paragraph (a)(2) of this section may:

(1) Qualify for a variable offset under § 2809.16; and

(2) Receive a refund for any unused application fees or processing costs if the lands identified in the application are subsequently leased to another entity under § 2809.13.

(c) After the effective date of this regulation, the BLM will not accept a new application for solar or wind energy development inside designated leasing areas (see §§ 2804.12(b)(1) and 2804.23(e)), except as provided by § 2809.17(d)(2).

(d) You may file a new application under part 2804 for testing and monitoring purposes inside designated leasing areas. If the BLM approves your application, you will receive a short term grant in accordance with § 2805.11(b)(2)(i) or (ii), which may qualify you for an offset under § 2809.16.
