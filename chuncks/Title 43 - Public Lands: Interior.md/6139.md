######## Verification of the temperature transducer.

(f)As part of each required meter proving and upon replacement, the temperature averager for a LACT system and the temperature transducer used in conjunction with a CMS must be verified against a known standard according to the following:

(1) The temperature averager or temperature transducer must be compared with a test thermometer traceable to NIST and with a stated accuracy of +/-0.25 &#xB0;F or better.

(2) The temperature reading displayed on the temperature averager or temperature transducer must be compared with the reading of the test thermometer using one of the following methods:

(i) The test thermometer must be placed in a test thermometer well located not more than 12&#x2033; from the probe of the temperature averager or temperature transducer; or

(ii) Both the test thermometer and probe of the temperature averager or temperature transducer must be placed in an insulated water bath. The water bath temperature must be within 20 &#xB0;F of the normal flowing temperature of the oil.

(3) The displayed reading of instantaneous temperature from the temperature averager or the temperature transducer must be compared with the reading from the test thermometer. If they differ by more than 0.5 &#xB0;F, then the difference in temperatures must be noted on the meter proving report and:

(i) The temperature averager or temperature transducer must be adjusted to match the reading of the test thermometer; or

(ii) The temperature averager or temperature transducer must be recalibrated, repaired, or replaced.
