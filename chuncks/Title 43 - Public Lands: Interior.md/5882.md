####### ยง 3162.2-11 How soon after I know of the likelihood of drainage must I take protective action?

(a) You must take protective action within a reasonable time after the earlier of:

(1) The date you knew or had constructive notice that the potentially draining well had begun to produce oil or gas; or

(2) The date we issued a demand letter for protective action.

(b) Since the time required to drill and produce a protective well varies according to the location and conditions of the oil and gas reservoir, BLM will determine this on a case-by-case basis. When we determine whether you took protective action within a reasonable time, we will consider several factors including, but not limited to:

(1) Time required to evaluate the characteristics and performance of the draining well;

(2) Rig availability;

(3) Well depth;

(4) Required environmental analysis;

(5) Special lease stipulations which provide limited time frames in which to drill; and

(6) Weather conditions.

(c) If BLM determines that you did not take protection action timely, you will owe compensatory royalty for the period of the delay under ยง 3162.2-12.
