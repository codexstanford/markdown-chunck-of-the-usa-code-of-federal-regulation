Each transfer of record title or of an operating right (sublease) shall be filed with the proper BLM office on a current form approved by the Director or exact reproductions of the front and back of such form.

A separate form for each transfer, in triplicate, originally executed shall be filed for each lease out of which a transfer is made. Only 1 originally executed copy of a transferee's request for approval for each transfer shall be required, including in those instances where several transfers to a transferee have been submitted at the same time (See also ยง 3106.4-3). Copies of documents other than the current form approved by the Director shall not be submitted. However, reference(s) to other documents containing information affecting the terms of the transfer may be made on the submitted form.
