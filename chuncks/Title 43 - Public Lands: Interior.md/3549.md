###### Rehabilitation and Betterment loans.

(c)If Reclamation makes a Rehabilitation and Betterment loan (pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Betterment Act of October 7, 1949, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 504) to a project that was authorized under Federal reclamation law prior to the submittal of the loan request, by or for the district, Reclamation:

(1) Considers the loan as a loan for maintenance, including replacements that cannot be financed currently;

(2) Does not consider the loan in determining whether the district has discharged its obligation to repay the construction cost of project facilities used to make irrigation water available for delivery to land in the district; and

(3) Will not allow such a loan to serve as the basis for reinstating acreage limitation provisions in a district that has completed payment of its construction obligation, nor serve as the basis for increasing the construction obligation of the district and thereby extending the period during which acreage limitation provisions will apply.
