####### Efficiency targets.

(3)To determine the efficiency target, the system delivery losses were divided into categories such as seepage, evaporation and operational losses. The "reasonable" level of savings for each category was then determined by starting with current operating experience and applying the added knowledge from several measures. Means of achieving the efficiency targets, including the specific conservation measures and amounts, are identified in the table Possible Water Conservation Measures for the Newlands Project. Applicable target efficiencies will be determined each year as described in ยง 418.13 (a)(4).
