######## Averaging period

means the previous 12 months or the life of the meter, whichever is shorter. For FMPs that measure production from a newly drilled well, the averaging period excludes production from that well that occurred in or before the first full month of production. (For example, if an oil FMP and a gas FMP were installed to measure only the production from a new well that first produced on April 10, the averaging period for this FMP would not include the production that occurred in April (partial month) and May (full month) of that year.)
