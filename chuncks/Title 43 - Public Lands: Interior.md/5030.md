####### ยง 2807.10 When can I start activities under my grant?

When you can start depends on the terms of your grant. You can start activities when you receive the grant you and BLM signed, unless the grant includes a requirement for BLM to provide a written Notice to Proceed. If your grant contains a Notice to Proceed requirement, you may not initiate construction, operation, maintenance, or termination until BLM issues you a Notice to Proceed.
