###### Skeletal deformities.

(B)Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of skeletal deformities, such as defects in growth of bones, when comparing samples from populations of wildlife species from the assessment area and a control area. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of injury when such physical deformations are observed in wildlife species exposed to oil or hazardous substances.
