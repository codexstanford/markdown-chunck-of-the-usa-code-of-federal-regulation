######## ยง 3503.33 Will BLM issue me a lease for unsurveyed lands?

No. All leased areas must be officially surveyed to BLM standards. If you are applying for a permit or lease on unsurveyed or protracted lands, you must pay for the survey. If BLM intends to issue a lease by competitive bidding, we will pay for surveying the lands.
