(b)The applicants for resurvey are required to preface their petition by the statement that the extent of privately owned lands within the township is in excess of 50 percent of the total area thereof. If necessary, information in this connection may be obtained by the petitioners from the manager of the land office having local jurisdiction. Failure to comply with the condition set forth in this section or material error in the showing made, will not only result in delaying action upon the petition, but may require its rejection if it is found that the township is not properly subject to resurvey under the terms of the governing Act.
