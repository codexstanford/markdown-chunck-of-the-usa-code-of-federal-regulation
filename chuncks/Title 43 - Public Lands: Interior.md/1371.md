##### ยง 11.72 Quantification phase - baseline services determination.
###### Air resources.

(i)(1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for air resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.

(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered on ambient air quality and source emissions to determine baseline conditions for the air resource. These historical data may be used to determine baseline conditions if the data satisfy the general guidelines in paragraph (d) of this section and if all the following criteria are met:

(i) The methodology used to obtain these historical data would detect the oil or hazardous substance at levels appropriate for comparison to the concentrations measured in ยง 11.71 of this part;

(ii) The effect of known or likely emission sources near the assessment area other than the source of the discharge or release can be identified or accounted for in the historical data; and

(iii) The historical data show that normal concentrations of the oil or hazardous substance are sufficiently predictable that changes as a result of the discharge or release are likely to be detectable.

(3) If historical data appropriate to determine baseline conditions at the assessment area are lacking, one or more control areas, as needed, shall be designated subject to the general criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the following additional factors, which shall also be considered in establishing a monitoring schedule;

(i) Applicable and available historical data shall be used to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part, in designating control areas or, lacking historical data, the factors in paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section shall be considered;

(ii) Control areas shall be spatially representative of the range of air quality and meteorological conditions likely to have occurred at the assessment area during the discharge or release into the atmosphere; and

(iii) The following additional factors shall be considered:

(A) The nature of the discharge or release and of potential alternative sources of the oil or hazardous substance, including such factors as existing sources, new sources, intermittent sources, mobile sources, exceptional events, trends, cycles, and the nature of the material discharged or released;

(B) Environmental conditions affecting transport, such as wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability, temperature, humidity, solar radiation intensity, and cloud cover; and

(C) Other factors, such as timing of the discharge or release, use patterns of the affected area, and the nature of the injury resulting from the discharge or release.

(4)(i) The preferred measurement method is to measure air concentrations of the oil or hazardous substance directly using the same methodology employed in ยง 11.71 of this part.

(ii) Nonspecific or chemical compound class methodologies may be used to determine baseline generically only in situations where it can be demonstrated that measuring indicator substances will adequately represent air concentrations of other components in a complex mixture.
