######## ยง 3809.581 Will BLM accept a replacement financial instrument?

(a) Yes, if you or a new operator have an approved financial guarantee, you may request BLM to accept a replacement financial instrument at any time after the approval of an initial instrument. BLM will review the offered instrument for adequacy and may reject any offered instrument, but will do so by a decision in writing, with a complete explanation of the reasons for the rejection, within 30 calendar days of the offering.

(b) A surety is not released from an obligation that accrued while the surety bond was in effect unless the replacement financial guarantee covers such obligations to BLM's satisfaction.
