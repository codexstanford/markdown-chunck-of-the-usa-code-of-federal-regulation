######## Net capacity factor

(1)means the average operational time divided by the average potential operational time of a solar or wind energy development, multiplied by the current technology efficiency rates. The BLM establishes net capacity factors for different technology types but may determine another net capacity factor to be more appropriate, on a case-by-case or regional basis, to reflect changes in technology, such as a solar or wind project that employs energy storage technologies, or if a grant or lease holder or applicant is able to demonstrate that another net capacity factor is appropriate for a particular project or region. The net capacity factor for each technology type is:

(i) Photovoltaic (PV)-20 percent;

(ii) Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) and concentrated solar power (CSP)-25 percent;

(iii) CSP with storage capacity of 3 hours or more-30 percent; and

(iv) Wind energy-35 percent;
