###### Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) inhibition.

(D)Injury has occurred when the activity level of whole blood ALAD in a sample from the population of a given species at an assessment area is significantly less than mean values for a population at a control area, and ALAD depression of at least 50 percent can be measured. The ALAD enzyme is associated with the formation of hemoglobin in blood and in chemical detoxification processes in the liver. This biological response is a measure of the rate of ALAD activity. This biological response may be used to determine injury to bird and mammal species that have been exposed to lead.
