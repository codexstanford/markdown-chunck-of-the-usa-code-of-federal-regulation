####### ยง 2520.0-8 Land subject to disposition.
######## Economic unit requirements, compactness.

(d)(1) One or more tracts of public lands may be included in a desert land entry and the tracts so entered need not be contiguous. All the tracts entered, however, shall be sufficiently close to each other to be managed satisfactorily as an economic unit. In addition, the lands in the entry must be in as compact a form as possible taking into consideration the character of available public lands and the effect of allowance of the entry on the remaining public lands in the area.

(2) In addition to the other requirements of the regulations in this part, applicants for desert land entry must submit with their applications information showing that the tracts applied for are sufficiently close to each other to be managed satisfactorily as an economic unit and that the lands in the application are as compact as possible in the circumstances.

(3) In determining whether an entry can be allowed in the form sought, the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will take into consideration such factors as the topography of the applied for and adjoining lands, the availability of public lands near the lands sought, the private lands farmed by the applicant, the farming systems and practices common to the locality and the character of the lands sought, and the practicability of farming the lands as an economically feasible operating unit.
