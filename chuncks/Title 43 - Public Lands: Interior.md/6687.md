####### ยง 3253.10 Must I share with BLM the data I collect through exploration operations?

(a) For exploration operations on your geothermal lease, you must submit all data you obtain as a result of the operations with a signed notice of completion of exploration operations under ยง 3253.11, unless we approve a later submission.

(b) For exploration operations on unleased lands or on leased lands where you are not the lessee or unit operator, you are not required to submit data. However, if you want your exploration operations to count toward your diligent exploration expenditure requirement (see ยง 3210.13), or if you are making significant expenditures to extend your lease (see ยง 3208.14), you must send BLM the resulting data under the rules of those sections.
