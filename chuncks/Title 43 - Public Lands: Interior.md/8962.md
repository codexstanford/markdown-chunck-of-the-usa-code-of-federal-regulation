######## Resurveys.

(b)The real interest of the Government in the resurvey of the public lands is well stated in the said Act of March 3, 1909, "to properly mark the boundaries of the public lands remaining undisposed of." Its duty being thus defined, the Bureau of Land Management will refrain from attempting to do more in the relocation of the corners of privately owned lands in a township being resurveyed than to reestablish such corners from the best available evidence of the original survey.
