####### ยง 4300.80 How can I get a permit to cross reindeer over public lands?

(a) BLM may issue a crossing permit free of charge when you file an application with BLM at least 30 days before the crossing is to begin. Lands crossed may include lands under a grazing permit.

(b) The application does not have to be on a BLM-approved form nor in a particular format, but it must show:

(1) The number of reindeer to be driven;

(2) The start date;

(3) The approximate period of time required for the crossing; and

(4) The land to be crossed.

(c) You must comply with applicable State and Federal laws on livestock quarantine and sanitation when crossing reindeer on public land.
