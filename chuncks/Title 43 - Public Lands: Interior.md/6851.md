A participating area terminates when either:

(a) The unit operator permanently stops operations in or affecting the participating area; or

(b) Sixty (60) days after BLM notifies the unit operator in writing that we have determined that operations in the participating area are not being conducted in accordance with the unit agreement, the participating area approval, or the public interest. If before the expiration of the 60 days, the unit operator demonstrates to BLM's satisfaction that the basis for BLM's determination is erroneous or has been rectified, BLM will not terminate the participating area.
