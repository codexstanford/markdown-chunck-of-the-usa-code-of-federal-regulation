###### Geologic resources.

(e)An injury to the geologic resource has resulted from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance if one or more of the following changes in the physical or chemical quality of the resource is measured:

(1) Concentrations of substances sufficient for the materials in the geologic resource to exhibit characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921;

(2) Concentrations of substances sufficient to raise the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration of the soil (pH) to above 8.5 (above 7.5 in humid areas) or to reduce it below 4.0;

(3) Concentrations of substances sufficient to yield a salt saturation value greater than 2 millimhos per centimeter in the soil or a sodium adsorption ratio of more than 0.176;

(4) Concentrations of substances sufficient to decrease the water holding capacity such that plant, microbial, or invertebrate populations are affected;

(5) Concentrations of substances sufficient to impede soil microbial respiration to an extent that plant and microbial growth have been inhibited;

(6) Concentrations in the soil of substances sufficient to inhibit carbon mineralization resulting from a reduction in soil microbial populations;

(7) Concentrations of substances sufficient to restrict the ability to access, develop, or use mineral resources within or beneath the geologic resource exposed to the oil or hazardous substance;

(8) Concentrations of substances sufficient to have caused injury to ground water, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, from physical or chemical changes in gases or water from the unsaturated zone;

(9) Concentrations in the soil of substances sufficient to cause a toxic response to soil invertebrates;

(10) Concentrations in the soil of substances sufficient to cause a phytotoxic response such as retardation of plant growth; or

(11) Concentrations of substances sufficient to have caused injury as defined in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (f), of this section to surface water, ground water, air, or biological resources when exposed to the substances.
