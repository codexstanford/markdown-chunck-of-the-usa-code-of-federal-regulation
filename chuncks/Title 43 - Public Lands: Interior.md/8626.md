###### Before You Apply for a Reindeer Grazing Permit
####### ยง 4300.10 On what types of public land can I obtain a reindeer grazing permit?

(a) You may apply for public lands that are vacant and unappropriated.

(b) You may apply for public lands which have been withdrawn for any purpose, but the Department or agency with administrative jurisdiction of the withdrawn lands must give its prior consent, and may impose terms or conditions on the use of the land.

(c) If the lands you apply for are within natural caribou migration routes, or if they have other important values for wildlife, BLM will consult with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game before issuing a permit. BLM may include such lands in a permit at its discretion, and a permit will contain any special terms and conditions to protect wildlife resources.
