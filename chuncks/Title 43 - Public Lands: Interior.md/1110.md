###### General.

(a)This section carries out section 6 of the Act. Under section 6 of the Act, each museum or Federal agency that has possession or control over collections which may contain unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must complete a summary of these collections based upon available information held by the museum or Federal agency. The purpose of the summary is to provide information about the collections to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that may wish to request repatriation of such objects. The summary serves in lieu of an object-by-object inventory of these collections, although, if an inventory is available, it may be substituted. Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that these requirements are met for all collections from their lands or generated by their actions whether the collections are held by the Federal agency or by a non-Federal institution.
