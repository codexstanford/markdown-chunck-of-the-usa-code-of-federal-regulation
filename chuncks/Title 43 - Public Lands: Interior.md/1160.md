###### Failure to claim prior to repatriation.

(a)(1) Any person who fails to make a timely claim prior to the repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to claim such items pursuant to these regulations or the Act. For these purposes, a "timely claim" means the filing of a written claim with a responsible museum or Federal agency official prior to the time the particular human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony at issue are duly repatriated or disposed of to a claimant by a museum or Federal agency pursuant to these regulations.

(2) If there is more than one (1) claimant, the human remains, funerary object, sacred object, or objects of cultural patrimony may be held by the responsible museum or Federal agency or person in possession thereof pending resolution of the claim. Any person who is in custody of such human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and does not claim entitlement to them must place the objects in the possession of the responsible museum or Federal agency for retention until the question of custody is resolved.
