###### ยง 404.32 Can Reclamation reduce the non-Federal cost-share required for an appraisal investigation?

Yes. Reclamation may reduce the non-Federal cost-share for appraisal investigations below 50 percent of the costs exceeding $200,000, if:

(a) Reclamation determines that there is an overwhelming Federal interest in conducting the appraisal investigation, and you demonstrate financial hardship. Financial hardship will be determined in accordance with Reclamation's official policies, guidance and standards, which are available at your local Reclamation office; and

(b) Reclamation consults with other Federal agencies that are partners in the project and determines that a reduction in the non-Federal cost-share is appropriate.
