##### ยง 10005.21 Amending the plan.
###### Comprehensive revision.

(1)The Act requires that the Commission "develop and adopt" a plan every five years. At the end of each five year period the Commission will undertake a comprehensive review of the plan to determine its adequacy and the need for revision. The need to revise, and add to, the Commission's portfolio of proposed projects will be central to this review. Other elements, for example, reconsideration of the Commission's objectives for the preceding five-year period and the Commission's standards for selecting projects, may also be reconsidered. Based on this review the Commission may call for the preparation of a new plan. The consultation procedures described in ยง 10005.7 will apply, as will the procedures described in ยง 10005.17, and the procedures described in ยง 10005.18. The Commission is not obligated to wait five years to undertake such revision to the plan. This may be undertaken at any time that the Commission deems appropriate.
