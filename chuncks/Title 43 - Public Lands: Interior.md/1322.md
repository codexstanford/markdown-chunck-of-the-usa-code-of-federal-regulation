###### Reduced fish reproduction.

(E)Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference in reproduction success between the control organisms and the test organisms can be measured based on the use of published standardized laboratory toxicity testing methodologies. This biological response may be used when the oil or hazardous substance is suspected to have caused a reduction in the reproductive success of fish species. Laboratory partial-chronic and laboratory chronic toxicity tests may be used. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused reduced reproductive success in the natural population of fish.
