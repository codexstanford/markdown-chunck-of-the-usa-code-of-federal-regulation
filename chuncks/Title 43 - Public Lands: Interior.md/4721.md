####### ยง 2720.3 Action upon determination of the fair market value of the mineral interests.

(a) Upon the authorized officer's determination that all of the requirements of the Act for conveyance of mineral interests have been met by the applicant and all actions necessary to determine the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests in land covered by the application have been completed, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests, including the administrative costs involved in development of and issuance of conveyance documents, and give a full and complete statement of the costs incurred in reaching such determination including any sum due the United States or that may be unexpended from the deposit made by the applicant. If the administrative costs of determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests exceed the amount of the deposit required of the applicant under this subpart, he will be informed that he is required to pay the difference between the actual costs and the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the administrative costs of determining the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests, the applicant will be informed that he is entitled to a credit for or a refund of the excess. The notice must require the applicant to pay both the fair market value of the Federal mineral interests and the remaining administrative costs owed within 90 days after the date the authorized officer mails the notice. Failure to pay the required amount within the allotted time shall constitute a withdrawal of the application and the application will be dismissed and the case closed.

(b) The Bureau of Land Management will convey mineral rights on lands for which this part does not require an exploratory program upon payment by the applicant of fair market value for those mineral interests and all administrative costs of processing the application to acquire the mineral rights.
