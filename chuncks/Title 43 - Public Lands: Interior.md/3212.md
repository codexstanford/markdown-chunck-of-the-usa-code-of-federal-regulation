The District will release sufficient water to meet the vested water rights below Sagouspe Dam as specified in thedecree. These water rights are usually met by return flows. Releases for these water rights will in no case exceed the portion of 1,300 acre-feet per year not supplied by return flows. This water must be accounted for at the USGS gauge number 10312275 (the Carson River at Tarzyn Road near Fallon). Releases for this purpose will not be considered in determining Project diversions since the lands to which the water is being delivered are not part of the Project. (See ยง 418.15(b)(2)(ii).) Any flow past this gage in excess of the amount specified in this part will be absorbed by the District as an efficiency loss.
