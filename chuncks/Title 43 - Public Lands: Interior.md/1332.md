###### Geologic pathway.

(e)(1) When geologic resources are suspected as the pathway or a component of the pathway, the authorized official shall determine, using guidance provided in this paragraph, whether geologic resources, either solely or in combination with other media, served as the exposure pathway for injury to the resource.

(2)(i) Using available information and the methods listed in ยง 11.64(e) of this part, it should be determined whether any element of the geologic resource has been exposed to the oil or hazardous substance. If a geologic resource is or has likely been exposed, the areal extent of the exposed geologic resource, including the lateral and vertical extent of the dispersion, should be estimated.

(ii) To determine whether the unsaturated zone served as a pathway, the guidance provided in paragraph (c) of this section should be followed.
