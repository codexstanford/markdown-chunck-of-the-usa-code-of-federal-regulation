The Act of May 21, 1930 (30 U.S.C. 301-306), authorizes either the leasing of oil and gas deposits under railroad and other rights-of-way to the owner of the right-of-way or the entering of a compensatory royalty agreement with adjoining landowners. This authority shall be exercised only with respect to railroad rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant either to the Act of March 3, 1875 (43 U.S.C. 934), or pursuant to earlier railroad right-of-way statutes, and with respect to rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1891 (43 U.S.C. 946). The oil and gas underlying any other right-of-way or easement is included within any oil and gas lease issued pursuant to the Act which covers the lands within the right-of-way, subject to the limitations on use of the surface, if any, set out in the statute under which, or permit by which, the right-of-way or easement was issued, and such oil and gas shall not be leased under the Act of May 21, 1930.
