######## Necessity.

(a)The applicants for the resurvey of any township are required to present satisfactory prima facie evidence of the necessity for such action. In general, it must be shown that the evidences of the original survey are so widely obliterated or that the prevailing survey conditions are so grossly defective as to preclude the satisfactory identification of the subdivisions of the subsisting survey or that the evidences of the original survey are in such an advanced state of deterioration that action looking to their preservation and perpetuation is expedient as in the public interest.
