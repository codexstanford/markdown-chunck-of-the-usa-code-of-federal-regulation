###### Definition of Class 1 land.

(c)Class 1 land is defined and will be classified as that irrigable land within a particular agricultural economic setting that:

(i) Most completely meets the various parameters and specifications established by Reclamation for irrigable land classes;

(ii) Has the relatively highest level of suitability for continuous, successful irrigation farming; and

(iii) Is estimated to have the highest relative productive potential measured in terms of net income per acre (reflecting both productivity and costs of production). The equivalency analysis will establish the acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in productive potential (measured in terms of net farm income) to 1 acre of Class 1 land.

(2) All land that Reclamation has not classified, or for which Reclamation has not yet performed the necessary economic studies, will be considered Class 1 land for the purposes of determining entitlements under these rules until such time as the necessary classifications or studies have been completed.
