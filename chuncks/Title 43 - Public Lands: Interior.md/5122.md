####### ยง 2812.8-2 Remedies for violations by licensee.

(a) No licensee of the United States will be authorized to use the roads of a permittee except under the terms of a timber sale contract or a cooperative agreement with the United States which will require the licensee to comply with all the applicable provisions of this paragraph, and any agreements or awards made pursuant thereto. If a licensee fails to comply with the regulations, agreements, or awards, the authorized officer will take such action as may be appropriate under the provisions of the timber sale contract or cooperative agreement.

(b) A permittee who believes that a licensee is violating the provisions of such a timber sale contract or cooperative agreement pertaining to use of the permittee's roads, rights-of-way, or lands, may petition the authorized officer, setting forth the grounds for his belief, to take such action against the licensee as may be appropriate under the contract or the cooperative agreement. In such event the permittee shall be bound by the decision of the authorized officer, subject, however, to a right of appeal pursuant to ยง 2812.9 and subject, further, to the general provisions of law respecting review of administrative determinations. In the alternative, a permittee who believes that a licensee has violated the terms of the timber sale contract or cooperative agreement respecting the use of the permittee's roads may proceed against the licensee in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such relief as may be appropriate in the premises.
