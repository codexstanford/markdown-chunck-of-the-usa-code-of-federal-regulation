###### Fish neoplasm.

(A)Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of occurrence of the fish neoplasia when comparing population samples from the assessment area and a control area. Neoplasms are characterized by relatively autonomous growth of abnormal cells that by proliferation infiltrate, press upon, or invade healthy tissue thereby causing destruction of cells, interference with physiological functions, or death of the organism. The following type of fish neoplasia may be used to determine injury: liver neoplasia and skin neoplasia. The neoplasms shall be confirmed by histological procedures and such confirmation procedures may also include special staining techniques for specific tissue components, ultra-structural examination using electron microscopy to identify cell origin, and to rule out or confirm viral, protozoan, or other causal agents. Fish neoplasm may be used to determine injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have been the causal agent.
