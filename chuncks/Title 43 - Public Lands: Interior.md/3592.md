#### PART 426 - ACREAGE LIMITATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
##### ยง 426.23 Recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.
###### Amount of O&M costs a district must pay if it amends its contract to conform to the discretionary provisions.

(c)If a district has a contract executed prior to October 12, 1982, and the district amends the contract after October 12, 1982, as provided for in ยง 426.3(a)(2) to conform to the discretionary provisions, then the following applies:

(1) The district must pay all of the O&M costs that Reclamation allocates to irrigation;

(2) If in the year the amendment is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&M costs allocated to the district in that year then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate and annually paid to the United States. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&M cost that results from paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and

(3) The district will not be required to pay an increased amount toward the construction costs of a project as a condition of the district's agreeing to a contract amendment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
