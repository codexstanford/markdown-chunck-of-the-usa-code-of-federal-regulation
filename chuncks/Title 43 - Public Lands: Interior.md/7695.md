(a) You may submit a written request for sale of mineral materials to the BLM office with jurisdiction over the site containing the materials. No particular form is required for this request.

(b) BLM also may initiate a sale without a request under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) You must pay a processing fee as provided in §§ 3602.31(b) and 3602.44(f). If the request is for mineral materials that are from a community pit or common use area this requirement does not apply.
