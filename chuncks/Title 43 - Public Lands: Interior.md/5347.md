####### ยง 2932.31 How does BLM establish fees for Special Recreation Permits?
######## Competitive or organized group/event use.

(2)BLM may charge a fee for recovery of costs to the agency of analyses and permit processing instead of the Special Recreation Permit fee, if-

(i) BLM needs more than 50 hours of staff time to process a Special Recreation Permit for competitive or organized group/event use in any one year, and

(ii) We anticipate that permit fees on the fee schedule for that year will be less than the costs of processing the permit.
