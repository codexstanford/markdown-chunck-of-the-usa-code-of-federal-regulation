##### Consultation or consult

means representatives of the government engaging in an open discussion process that allows interested parties to address potential issues, changes, or actions. Consultation does not necessarily require formal face-to-face meetings. The complexity of the matter along with the potential effects that the matter may have on the Trust or beneficiaries will dictate the appropriate process for consultation. Consultation requires dialogue (oral, electronic, or printed) or a good faith, dialogue or documented effort to engage with the beneficiaries, consideration of their views, and, where feasible, seek agreement with the beneficiaries when engaged in the land exchange process.
