######## ยง 2806.31 How will BLM calculate rent for a right-of-way for communication uses in the schedule?
######### Annual statement.

(c)By October 15 of each year, you, as a grant or lease holder, must submit to BLM a certified statement listing any tenants and customers in your facility or facilities and the category of use for each tenant or customer as of September 30 of the same year. BLM may require you to submit any additional information needed to calculate your rent. BLM will determine the rent based on the certified statement provided. We require only facility owners or facility managers to hold a grant or lease (unless you are an occupant in a federally-owned facility as described in ยง 2806.42 of this subpart), and will charge you rent for your grant or lease based on the total number of communication uses within the right-of-way and the type of uses and population strata the facility or site serves.
