####### ยง 3173.9 Required recordkeeping for inventory and seal records.
######## For example:

If the first inventory measurement performed on January 12 is 125 bbl, the second inventory measurement performed on February 10 is 150 bbl, the gross sales volume between the first and second inventory is 198 bbl, and February is the calendar month for which the report is due. For purposes of this example, we assume February had 28 days and that the well was non-producing for two of those days.

(b) For each seal, the operator must maintain a record that includes:

(1) The unique identifying number of each seal and the valve or meter component on which the seal is or was used;

(2) The date of installation or removal of each seal;

(3) For valves, the position (open or closed) in which it was sealed; and

(4) The reason the seal was removed.
