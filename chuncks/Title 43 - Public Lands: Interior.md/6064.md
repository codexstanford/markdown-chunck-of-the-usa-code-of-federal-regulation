######## Indicated volume

means the uncorrected volume indicated by the meter in a lease automatic custody transfer system or the Coriolis meter in a CMS. For a positive displacement meter, the indicated volume is represented by the non-resettable totalizer on the meter head. For Coriolis meters, the indicated volume is the uncorrected (without the meter factor) mass of liquid divided by the density.
