(4)This paragraph (a)(4) applies unless you selected the scheduled rate adjustment method (see ยง 2806.61). Once the acreage rent is determined under ยง 2806.62(a), no further adjustments in the annual acreage rent will be made until year 11 of the lease term and each subsequent 10-year period thereafter. We will use the per acre zone rates in effect at the time the acreage rent is due (at the beginning of each 10-year period) to calculate the annual acreage rent for each of the subsequent 10-year periods.
