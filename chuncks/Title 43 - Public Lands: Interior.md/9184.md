###### Unmet needs.

(2)Projects will satisfy significant needs that would not otherwise be met. To meet the Unmet Needs standard, projects should:

(i) Address significant fish, wildlife, or recreation needs that are unable to secure adequate funding from other sources,

(ii) Not duplicate actions already taken or underway, and/or

(iii) Not substitute for actions that are the responsibility of another agency and that must be implemented regardless of Commission involvement. This is not meant to restrict the Commission's ability to be involved in projects advanced by land management or other agencies that, while within the general responsibility of the agency, cannot be implemented because of internal funding limitations.
