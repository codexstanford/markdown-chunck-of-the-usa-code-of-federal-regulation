####### Maximum allowable efficiency debits (MED).

(b)The debits in Lahontan Reservoir storage from the District's actual conveyance efficiency not achieving the target efficiency can accumulate over time. If these amounts of borrowed storage get too large they may not be offset later by increased efficiencies and may severely affect the District's water users by imposing an added "drought" on top of a real one. Therefore, the maximum efficiency debit cushion is set at 26,000 acre-feet. However, unlike the MAD, it only applies to the subsequent year's operation. The MED is approximately 9 percent of the headgate entitlements.
