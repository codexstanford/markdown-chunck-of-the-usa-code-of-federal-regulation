####### ยง 3471.3-2 Sale of underlying interests.

If, in any proceeding to cancel or forfeit a lease or any interest therein acquired in violation of any of the provisions of the mineral leasing laws, the lease or interest therein is cancelled or forfeited, and if there are valid options to acquire the lease or an interest therein that are not subject to cancellation, forfeiture, or compulsory disposition, this lease or interest therein shall be sold to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding, in a manner similar to that provided for in the offering of leases by competitive bidding, subject to all outstanding valid interests and options. If less than the whole interest in the lease or interest therein is cancelled or forfeited, the partial interest shall be sold in the same way. If no satisfactory offer is obtained as a result of the competitive offering of a whole or partial interest, it may be sold by other methods that the authorized officer finds appropriate. However, the terms shall not be less favorable to the Government than those of the best competitive bid received.
