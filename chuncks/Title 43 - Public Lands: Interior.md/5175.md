######## Processing Category 6.

(2)You are responsible for processing costs identified in your application. If BLM cannot readily separate costs, such as costs associated with preparing environmental analyses, you and any competing applicants must pay an equal share or a proportion agreed to in writing among all applicants and BLM. If you agree to share costs that are common to your application and that of a competing applicant, and the competitor does not pay the agreed upon amount, you are liable for the entire amount due. The applicants must pay the entire processing fee in advance. BLM will not process the application until we receive the advance payments.
