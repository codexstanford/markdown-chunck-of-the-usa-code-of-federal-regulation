###### How the Secretary determines the penalty amount.

(g)(1) The penalty amount must be determined on the record;

(2) The penalty amount must be .25 percent of your museum's annual budget, or $8,054, whichever is less, and such additional sum as the Secretary may determine is appropriate after taking into account:

(i) The archeological, historical, or commercial value of the human remains, funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony involved; and

(ii) The damages suffered, both economic and non-economic, by the aggrieved party or parties including, but not limited to, expenditures by the aggrieved party to compel the museum to comply with the Act; and

(iii) The number of violations that have occurred at your museum.

(3) An additional penalty of up to $1,612 per day after the date that the final administrative decision takes effect may be assessed if your museum continues to violate the Act.

(4) The Secretary may reduce the penalty amount if there is:

(i) A determination that you did not willfully fail to comply; or

(ii) An agreement by you to mitigate the violation, including, but not limited to, payment of restitution to the aggrieved party or parties; or

(iii) A determination that you are unable to pay, provided that this factor may not apply if you have been previously found to have failed to comply with these regulations; or,

(iv) A determination that the penalty constitutes excessive punishment under the circumstances.
