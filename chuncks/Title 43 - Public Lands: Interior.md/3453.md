### Chapter I - Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior
#### PART 426 - ACREAGE LIMITATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
##### § 426.6 Leasing and full-cost pricing.
###### Types of lands that count against the nonfull-cost entitlement.

(d)(1) All directly and indirectly owned irrigation land and irrigation land directly or indirectly leased for any period of time during 1-water year counts towards a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement, except:

(i) Involuntarily acquired land, as provided in §§ 426.12 and 426.14; and

(ii) Land that is leased for incidental grazing or similar purposes during periods when the land is not receiving irrigation water.

(2) Reclamation's process for determining if a nonfull-cost entitlement has been exceeded is as follows:

(i) All land counted toward a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement will be counted on a cumulative basis during any 1-water year;

(ii) Once a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement is met in a given water year, any additional eligible land may be irrigated only at the full-cost rate; and

(iii) Irrigation land will be counted towards nonfull-cost entitlements on a westwide basis, even for prior law recipients, regardless of the date of acquisition.
