######## Post-office addresses of applicants and witnesses.

(b)Applicants and witnesses must in all cases state their places of actual residence, their business or occupation, and their post-office addresses. It is not sufficient to name only the county or State in which a person lives, but the town or city must be named also; and where the residence is in a city the street and number must be given. It is especially important to claimants that upon changing their post-office addresses they promptly notify the authorizing officer of such change, for in case of failure to do so their entries may be canceled upon notice sent to the address of record but not received by them.
