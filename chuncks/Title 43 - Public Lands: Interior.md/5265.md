####### ยง 2916.0-6 Policy.

(a) The authority to lease the public lands in Alaska for fur-farming purposes was granted in order to promote the development of the production of furs in Alaska.

(b) No lease for the purpose of raising beavers will be granted on any area already occupied by a beaver colony nor will any such lease be granted on streams or lakes where the activities of beavers may interfere with the run or spawning of salmon.

(c) In order to offer more people an opportunity to lease lands, and to avoid tying up large areas of land unnecessarily, fur-farming leases on public lands will not be granted for areas greater than are justified by the needs and experience of the applicant.
