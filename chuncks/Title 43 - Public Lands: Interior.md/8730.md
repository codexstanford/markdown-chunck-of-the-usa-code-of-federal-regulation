###### ยง 5040.5 How does BLM determine and declare the annual productive capacity?

(a) If BLM has not established sustained-yield forest units under part 5040, then BLM will determine and declare the annual productive capacity by applying the sustained-yield principle to the O. and C. lands, treating them as a single unit.

(b) If BLM has established sustained-yield forest units under part 5040, then BLM will determine and declare the annual productive capacity by applying the sustained-yield principle to each separate forest unit.

(c) If it occurs that BLM has established sustained-yield forest units for less than all of the O. and C. lands, then BLM will determine and declare the annual productive capacity as follows:

(1) BLM will treat sustained-yield forest units as in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(2) BLM will treat any O. and C. lands not located within sustained-yield forest units as a single unit.
