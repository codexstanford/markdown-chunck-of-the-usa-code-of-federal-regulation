If you hold a right-of-way authorizing wind energy site-specific testing or project-area testing or wind energy development, you must pay an annual rent and fee in accordance with this section and subpart. Your wind energy development right-of-way authorization will either be a grant (if issued under subpart 2804) or a lease (if issued under subpart 2809). Rents and fees for either type of authorization consist of an acreage rent that must be paid prior to issuance of the authorization and a phased-in MW capacity fee. Both the acreage rent and the phased-in MW capacity fee are charged and calculated consistent with ยง 2806.11 and prorated consistent with ยง 2806.12(a). The MW capacity fee will vary depending on the size of the wind energy development project.
