####### ยง 3000.10 What do I need to know about fees in general?
######## Periodic adjustment.

(c)We will periodically adjust fees established in this subchapter according to change in the Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product, which is published quarterly by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Because the fee recalculations are simply based on a mathematical formula, we will change the fees in final rules without opportunity for notice and comment.
