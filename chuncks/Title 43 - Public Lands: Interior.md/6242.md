####### ยง 3175.80 Flange-tapped orifice plates (primary devices).
######## Meter tube lengths.

(k)(1) Meter-tube lengths and the location of 19-tube-bundle flow straighteners, if applicable, must comply with API 14.3.2, Subsection 6.3 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3175.30).

(2) For Beta ratios of less than 0.5, the location of 19-tube bundle flow straighteners installed in compliance with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.4 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3175.30), also complies with the location of 19-tube bundle flow straighteners as required in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.

(3) If the diameter ratio (&#x3B2;) falls between the values in Tables 7, 8a, or 8b of API 14.3.2, Subsection 6.3 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3175.30), the length identified for the larger diameter ratio in the appropriate Table is the minimum requirement for meter-tube length and determines the location of the end of the 19-tube-bundle flow straightener closest to the orifice plate. For example, if the calculated diameter ratio is 0.41, use the table entry for a 0.50 diameter ratio.
