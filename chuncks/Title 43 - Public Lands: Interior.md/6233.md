######## Meter tubes.

(a)Meter tubes installed at high- and low-volume FMPs before January 17, 2017 are exempt from the meter tube requirements of API 14.3.2, Subsection 6.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), and § 3175.80(f) and (k). For high-volume FMPs, the BLM will add an uncertainty of +/-0.25 percent to the discharge coefficient uncertainty when determining overall meter uncertainty under § 3175.31(a), unless the PMT reviews, and the BLM approves, data showing otherwise. Meter tubes grandfathered under this section must still meet the following requirements:

(1) Orifice plate eccentricity must comply with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.2.4 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).

(2) Meter tube construction and condition must comply with AGA Report No. 3 (1985), Section 4.3.4 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30).
