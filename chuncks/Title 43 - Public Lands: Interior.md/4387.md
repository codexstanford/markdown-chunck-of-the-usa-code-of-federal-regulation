######## ยง 2568.80 Does the parcel have to be surveyed before I can receive title to it?

Yes. The land in your application must be surveyed before BLM can convey it to you. BLM will survey your allotment at no charge to you, or you may obtain a private survey. BLM must approve the survey if it is done by a private surveyor.
