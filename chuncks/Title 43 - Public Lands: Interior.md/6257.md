######## Redundancy verification procedures.

(d)Redundancy verifications must be performed as required under API 21.1, Subsection 8.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30), with the following exceptions, additions, and clarifications:

(1) The operator must identify which set of transducers is used for reporting on the OGOR (the primary transducers) and which set of transducers is used as a check (the check set of transducers);

(2) For every calendar month, the operator must compare the flow-time linear averages of differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature readings from the primary transducers with those from the check transducers;

(3)(i) If for any transducer the difference between the averages exceeds the tolerance defined by the following equation:

(ii) The operator must verify both the primary and check transducer under paragraph (c) of this section within the first 5 days of the month following the month in which the redundancy verification was performed. For example, if the redundancy verification for March reveals that the difference in the flow-time linear averages of differential pressure exceeded the verification tolerance, both the primary and check differential-pressure transducers must be verified under paragraph (c) of this section by April 5th.

(e) The operator must retain documentation of each verification for the period required under § 3170.7 of this part, including calibration data for transducers that were replaced, and submit it to the BLM upon request.

(1) For routine verifications, this documentation must include:

(i) The information required in § 3170.7(g) of this part;

(ii) The time and date of the verification and the last verification date;

(iii) Primary device data (meter-tube inside diameter and differential-device size, Beta or area ratio);

(iv) The type and location of taps (flange or pipe, upstream or downstream static tap);

(v) The flow computer make and model;

(vi) The make and model number for each transducer, for component-type EGM systems;

(vii) Transducer data (make, model, differential, static, temperature URL, and upper calibrated limit);

(viii) The normal operating points for differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature;

(ix) Atmospheric pressure;

(x) Verification points (as-found and applied) for each transducer;

(xi) Verification points (as-left and applied) for each transducer, if calibration was performed;

(xii) The differential device inspection date and condition (e.g., clean, sharp edge, or surface condition);

(xiii) Verification equipment make, model, range, accuracy, and last certification date;

(xiv) The name, contact information, and affiliation of the person performing the verification and any witness, if applicable; and

(xv) Remarks, if any.

(2) For redundancy verification checks, this documentation must include;

(i) The information required in § 3170.7(g) of this part;

(ii) The month and year for which the redundancy check applies;

(iii) The makes, models, upper range limits, and upper calibrated limits of the primary set of transducers;

(iv) The makes, models, upper range limits, and upper calibrated limits of the check set of transducers;

(v) The information required in API 21.1, Annex I (incorporated by reference, see § 3175.30);

(vii) The tolerance for differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature as calculated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and

(viii) Whether or not each transducer required verification under paragraph (c) of this section.
