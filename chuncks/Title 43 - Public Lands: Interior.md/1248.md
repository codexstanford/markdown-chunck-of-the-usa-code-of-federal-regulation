###### Preassessment phase costs.

(g)(1) The following categories of reasonable and necessary costs may be incurred in the preassessment phase of the damage assessment:

(i) Release detection and identification costs;

(ii) Trustee identification and notification costs;

(iii) Potentially injured resource identification costs;

(iv) Initial sampling, data collection, and evaluation costs;

(v) Site characterization and preassessment screen costs; and

(vi) Any other preassessment costs for activities authorized by §§ 11.20 through 11.25 of this part.

(2) The reasonable and necessary costs for these categories shall be limited to those costs incurred by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable to, site-specific efforts taken during the preassessment phase for assessment of damages to natural resources for which the agency or Indian tribe is acting as trustee. Such costs shall be supported by appropriate records and documentation and shall not reflect regular activities performed by the agency or Indian tribe in management of the natural resource. Activities undertaken as part of the preassessment phase shall be taken in a manner that is cost-effective, as that phrase is used in this part.
