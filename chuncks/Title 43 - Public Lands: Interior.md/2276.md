(d)(1) Applicants and their contractors and subcontractors which are required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to submit affirmative action plans to the Federal Inspector for approval shall provide the Federal Inspector with the following information at the time the affirmative action plan is submitted:

(i) A brief description of pending applications to any Federal agency for Federal financial assistance or the award of a government contract, as well as any Federal assistance being received, or any government contracts or subcontracts being performed;

(ii) Whether the applicant, contractor, or subcontractor has been the subject of a compliance review conducted by the Department of Labor pursuant to 41 CFR part 60-1 within the preceding twelve months;

(iii) Whether any Federal, State or local government agency has found the applicant, contractor, or subcontractor in non-compliance or has found reasonable cause to believe the applicant, contractor, or subcontractor is in violation of, or in non-conpliance with, any civil rights requirements;

(iv) A description of the methods by which the applicant, contractor, or subcontractor will insure that its contractors and subcontractors comply with the provisions of the affirmative action plans during the term of the contracts;

(2) The Federal Inspector shall consider conducting an on-site review before the award of any Federal authorizations, agreements to assign Federal authorizations, contracts or subcontracts under which substantial employment or procurement opportunities will be offered;

(3) The Federal Inspector will determine whether the affirmative action plans are adequate. If deficiencies are found to exist in a plan, the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor shall correct the deficiencies in consultation with the Federal Inspector. If deficiencies are not corrected to the satisfaction of the Federal Inspector, the Inspector may enforce compliance with this section through measures authorized by ANGTA or any other provision of law.

(4) Upon approval of the affirmative action plan-including the goals and timetables-of the applicants or recipients, the Federal Inspector shall publicize the goals and timetables which are approved for each segment. Notice should be sent to all parties who submitted comments to the Department of the Interior in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued about these regulations on October 12, 1979 (44 FR 59096).

(5) The Federal Inspector may, upon request, grant exemptions from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section to any bidder which can demonstrate that no significant employment opportunities will result from an award of a contract to the bidder.
