######## § 2806.54 Rents and fees for solar energy development leases.
######### Scheduled rate adjustment.

(d)Under the scheduled rate adjustment (see § 2806.51), the BLM will update your per acre zone rate and MW rate as follows:

(1) The BLM will calculate your payments using the per acre zone rate (see § 2806.52(a)(1)) and MW rate (see § 2806.52(b)(1)) in place when your lease is issued;

(2) The per acre zone rate will increase every 10 years, beginning after the first 10 years, plus the initial partial year, if any, your lease is in effect, by the average annual change in the IPD-GDP for the preceding 10-year period as described in § 2806.22(b) plus 40 percent;

(3) The MW rate will increase by 40 percent every 10 years, beginning after the first 10 years, plus the initial partial year, if any, your lease is in effect;

(4) The BLM will not apply the phase-in to your MW rate under § 2806.52(c). Instead, for years 1 through 5, plus any initial partial year, the BLM will calculate the MW capacity fee by multiplying the project's authorized MW capacity by 50 percent of the applicable solar technology MW rate. This phase-in will not be applied to renewed leases; and

(5) If the approved POD for your project provides for staged development, the BLM will calculate the MW capacity fee using the MW capacity approved for the current stage plus any previously approved stages, multiplied by the MW rate, as described under this section.
