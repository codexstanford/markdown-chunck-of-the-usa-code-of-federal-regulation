###### Landholder actions to conform to the discretionary provisions.

(f)(1) In the absence of a district's action to conform to the discretionary provisions, United States citizens, resident aliens, or legal entities established under State or Federal law, can elect to conform to the discretionary provisions by executing an irrevocable election. Upon execution of an irrevocable election:

(i) The elector's entire landholding in all districts shall be subject to the discretionary provisions;

(ii) The election shall be binding on the elector and his or her landholding, but will not be binding on subsequent landholders of that land;

(iii) An irrevocable election by a legal entity is binding only upon that entity and not on the part owners of that entity;

(iv) An irrevocable election by a part owner of a legal entity binds only the part owner making the election and not the entity or other part owners of the entity; and

(v) An irrevocable election by a lessor does not affect the status of a lessee, and vice versa. However, the eligibility and entitlement of neither a lessor nor a lessee may be enhanced through leasing.

(2) A landholder makes an irrevocable election by completing a Reclamation issued irrevocable election form:

(i) The elector's original irrevocable election form must be filed by the district with Reclamation and must be accompanied by a completed certification form, as specified in ยง 426.18;

(ii) The elector must file copies of the irrevocable election and certification forms concurrently with each district where the elector holds nonexempt land;

(iii) Reclamation will prepare a letter advising the recipient of the approval or disapproval of the election. Reclamation will base approval upon whether the election form and the accompanying certification form(s) indicate the elector's satisfaction of the various requirements of Federal reclamation law and these regulations;

(iv) If the election is approved, the letter of approval, with a copy of the irrevocable election form and the original certification form(s), will be sent by Reclamation to each district where the elector holds land;

(v) The district(s) shall retain the forms; and

(vi) If the irrevocable election is disapproved, the landholder and the district will be advised by letter along with the reasons for disapproval.

(3) A landholder that only holds land indirectly in a district that has conformed to the discretionary provisions, other than a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, may make an irrevocable election also by simply submitting certification forms to all districts where the landholder holds land subject to the acreage limitation provisions. An election made in this manner is binding in all districts in which such elector holds land.
