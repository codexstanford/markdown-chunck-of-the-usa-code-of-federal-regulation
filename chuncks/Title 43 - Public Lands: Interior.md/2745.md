##### ยง 46.30 Definitions.
###### e.g.

(1) This term has two interpretations. First "no action" may mean "no change" from a current management direction or level of management intensity (, if no ground-disturbance is currently underway, no action means no ground-disturbance). Second "no action" may mean "no project" in cases where a new project is proposed for implementation.

(2) The Responsible Official must determine the "no action" alternative consistent with one of the definitions in paragraph (1) of this definition and appropriate to the proposed action to be analyzed in an environmental impact statement. The no action alternative looks at effects of not approving the action under consideration.
