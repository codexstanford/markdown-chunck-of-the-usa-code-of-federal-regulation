Section 4 of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976, amending 30 U.S.C. 201(b), repealed the Secretary's authority to issue or extend a coal prospecting permit on Federal lands. Therefore, these regulations apply only to preference right lease applications based on prospecting permits issued prior to August 4, 1976. The surface owner consent provisions of section 714 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1304) do not apply to preference right lease applications.
