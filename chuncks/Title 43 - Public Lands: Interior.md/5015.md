(c)This paragraph (c) applies unless you selected the scheduled rate adjustment method (see ยง 2806.61).

(1) If you hold a wind energy grant and made payments for billing year 2016, the BLM will reduce by 50 percent the net increase in annual costs between billing year 2017 and billing year 2016. The net increase will be calculated based on a full calendar year.

(2) If the BLM accepted your application for a wind energy development grant, including a plan of development and cost recovery agreement, prior to September 30, 2014, the BLM will phase in your payment of the acreage rent and MW capacity fee by reducing the:

(i) Acreage rent of the grant by 50 percent for the initial partial year of the grant; and

(ii) MW capacity fee by 75 percent for the first (initial partial) and second years and by 50 percent for the third and fourth years for which the BLM requires payment of the MW capacity fee. This reduction to the MW capacity fee applies to each stage of development.
