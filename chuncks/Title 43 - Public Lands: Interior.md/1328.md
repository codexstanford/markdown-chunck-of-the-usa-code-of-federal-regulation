(ii) The rate or mechanism of transport by natural processes of the discharged oil or released hazardous substance; and

(iii) Combinations of pathways that, when viewed together, may transport the discharged oil or released hazardous substance to the resource.

(2) The pathway may be determined by either demonstrating the presence of the oil or hazardous substance in sufficient concentrations in the pathway resource or by using a model that demonstrates that the conditions existed in the route and in the oil or hazardous substance such that the route served as the pathway.
