#### PART 426 - ACREAGE LIMITATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
##### ยง 426.9 Religious or charitable organizations.
###### Acreage limitation status of religious or charitable organizations that are subject to the discretionary provisions.

(b)(1) Religious or charitable organizations or their subdivisions that are subject to the discretionary provisions have qualified recipient status, if:

(i) The organization's or subdivision's agricultural produce and proceeds from the sales of such produce are used only for charitable purposes;

(ii) The organization or subdivision, itself, operates the land; and

(iii) No part of the net earnings of the organization or subdivision accrues to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.

(2) If Reclamation determines that a religious or charitable organization or any of its subdivisions does not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then:

(i) If the central organization has not met the criteria, Reclamation will treat the entire organization, including all subdivisions, as a single entity; or

(ii) If a subdivision has not met the criteria, only that subdivision and any subdivisions of it will be treated as a single entity and not the central organization or other subdivisions of the central organization; and

(iii) In order to ascertain the acreage limitation status, Reclamation determines the total number of members in both the organization that has not met the criteria and in any subdivisions that are under that organization. If Reclamation determines that total number equals:

(A) More than 25 members, then Reclamation treats that organization and every subdivision under that organization as a single legal entity with a limited recipient status; or

(B) 25 members or less, then Reclamation treats that organization and every subdivision under that organization as a single legal entity with a qualified recipient status.
