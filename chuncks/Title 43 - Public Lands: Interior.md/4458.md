######## § 2569.504 Once I file, can I change my land selection?

(a) Once your application is received in accordance with § 2569.411, you will only be allowed to amend your selection until 60 days after you receive the Notice of Survey as set forth in § 2569.501(e). Your amended selection will be considered a new application for purposes of preference, as set forth in § 2569.411(c), but you will not need to resubmit any portions of your application other than the land description and map.

(b) Otherwise, you will not be allowed to change your selection except as set forth in § 2569.502 or § 2569.503.

(c) If an applicant relinquishes their application more than 60 days after they receive the Notice of Survey as set forth in § 2569.501(e), the applicant will only be able to submit a new application for a new selection if their original selection is no longer available.
