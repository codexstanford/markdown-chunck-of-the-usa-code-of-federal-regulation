######## Base rent

means the dollar amount required from a grant or lease holder on BLM managed lands based on the communication use with the highest value in the associated facility or facilities, as calculated according to the communication use rent schedule. If a facility manager's or facility owner's scheduled rent is equal to the highest rent charged a tenant in the facility or facilities, then the facility manager's or facility owner's use determines the dollar amount of the base rent. Otherwise, the facility owner's, facility manager's, customer's, or tenant's use with the highest value, and which is not otherwise excluded from rent, determines the base rent.
