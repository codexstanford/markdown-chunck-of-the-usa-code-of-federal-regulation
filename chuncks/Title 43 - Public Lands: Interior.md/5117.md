####### § 2812.6-2 Terms and conditions of permit.

(a) As to all permits: Every permittee shall agree:

(1) To comply with the applicable regulations in effect as of the time when the permit is issued and, as to the permittee's roads as to which the United States has received rights under §§ 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 with such additional regulations as may be issued from time to time relating to the use of roads for the purpose of access by properly licensed hunters and fishermen and by other recreationalists to lands of the United States in the O. and C. area which are suitable for such recreational purposes, where such use will not unreasonably interfere with the use of the road by the permittee for the transportation of forest products or unduly enhance the risk of fire, collision, or other hazards on such road and on lands in the vicinity thereof. If, notwithstanding the request of the authorized officer that the permittee allow use of a road in conformity with such additional regulations the permittee shall unreasonably withhold his assent, the authorized officer shall refer the disagreement through the proper channels to the Director of the Bureau for his consideration, and, if the Director concurs in the conclusion of the authorized officer and if the matter is still in dispute, he shall refer the matter to the Secretary of the Interior for his consideration. In the event of the Secretary's concurrence in the conclusions of the authorized officer, and if the permittee nevertheless unreasonably withholds such assent, the United States may institute such judicial proceedings as may be appropriate to enforce said regulations.

(2) Not to cut, remove, or destroy any timber not previously purchased on the right-of-way without having first obtained specific authority from the authorized officer and making payment therefor.

(3) To take adequate precaution to prevent forest, brush, and grass fires; to endeavor with all available personnel to suppress any fire originating on or threatening the right-of-way on which a road is being used or constructed by the permittee or any fire caused by the permittee; to do no burning on or near the right-of-way without State permit during the seasons that permits are required and in no event to set fire on or near the right-of-way that will result in damage to any natural resource or improvement.

(4) To submit to arbitration proceedings and to be bound by the resulting arbitral awards, pursuant to §§ 2812.4-1, 2812.4-3, and 2812.4-4.

(5) In the event that the United States acquires by purchase or eminent domain the land or any interest therein, over which there passes a road which the United States has acquired the right to use under §§ 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 of this subpart to waive compensation for the value of the road, equivalent to the proportion that the amount the United States has contributed bears to the total actual cost of construction of the road. Such contribution shall include any investment in or amortization of the cost of such road, or both, as the case may be, made by the United States or a licensee either by way of direct expenditures upon such road, or by way of payment by the United States or a licensee to the permittee, or by way of allowance made by the United States to the permittee in any timber sales contract for such amortization or capital investment.

(6) To construct all roads and other improvements as described in the application for the permit, except as the authorized officer may authorize modification or abandonment of any such proposed construction.

(7) To use the permit and right-of-way afforded subject to all valid existing rights, to such additional rights-of-way as may be granted under this paragraph to a reservation of rights-of-way for ditches and canals constructed under authority of the United States.

(8) Not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin, and to require an identical provision to be included in all subcontracts.
