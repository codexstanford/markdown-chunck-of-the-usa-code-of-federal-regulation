######## Cutting rules and restrictions.

(c)All free-use timber shall be cut and removed in accordance with approved forestry and conservation practices so as to preserve to the maximum extent feasible all scenic, recreational, watershed, and other values of the land and resources. In the free-use disposal of timber, the cutting and removal shall be accomplished in such manner as to leave the stand in condition for continuous production. Moreover, no green timber shall be cut within 300 feet of either side of the center line of a highway or public road, or bordering streams or the shores of lakes designated for recreational use unless specifically authorized by the authorized officer, to prevent or control fungus infection or insect attacks, or for other reasons found sufficient to justify such cutting.
