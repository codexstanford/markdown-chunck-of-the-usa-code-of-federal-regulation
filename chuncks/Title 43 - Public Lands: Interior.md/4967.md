When a communication facility is ancillary to, and authorized by BLM under, a grant for a linear use, or some other type of use authorization (e.g., a mineral lease or sundry notice), BLM will determine the rent using the linear rent schedule (ยง 2806.20 of this subpart) or rent scheme associated with the other authorization, and not the communication use rent schedule.
