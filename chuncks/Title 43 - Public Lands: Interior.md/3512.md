###### Excess land that is disposed of and subsequently reacquired.

(g)Districts may not make available irrigation water to excess land disposed of by a landholder at a price approved by Reclamation, whether or not under a recordable contract, if the landholder subsequently becomes a direct or indirect landholder of that land through either a voluntary or involuntary action, unless:

(1) The landholder became or contracted to become a direct or indirect landholder of that land prior to December 18, 1996, and the land in question is otherwise eligible to receive irrigation water;

(2) Such land becomes exempt from the acreage limitations of Federal reclamation law;

(3) The landholder pays the full-cost rate for any irrigation water delivered to the landholder's formerly excess land that is otherwise eligible to receive irrigation water. If a landholder is a part owner of a legal entity that becomes the direct or indirect landholder of the land in question, then the full-cost rate will be applicable to the proportional share of irrigation water delivered to the land that reflects the part owner's interest in that legal entity; or

(4) The deed covenant associated with the sale has expired as provided for in paragraph (i) of this section.
