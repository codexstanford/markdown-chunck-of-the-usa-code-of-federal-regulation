######## see

(e) BLM will not renew grants issued before October 21, 1976. If you hold such a grant and would like to continue to use the right-of-way beyond your grant's expiration date, you must apply to BLM for a new FLPMA grant (subpart 2804 of this part). You must send BLM your application at least 120 calendar days before your grant expires.

(f) If you make a timely and sufficient application for a renewal of your existing grant or lease, or for a new grant or lease, in accordance with this section, the existing grant does not expire until we have issued a decision to approve or deny the application.

(g) If BLM denies your application, you may appeal the decision under ยง 2801.10 of this part.
