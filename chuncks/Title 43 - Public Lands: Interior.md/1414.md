###### Adjustments.

(b)(1) In establishing the account pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the calculation of the expected present value of the damage amount should be adjusted, as appropriate, whenever monies are to be placed in a non-interest bearing account. This adjustment should correct for the anticipated effects of inflation over the time estimated to complete expenditures for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.

(2) In order to make the adjustment in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the authorized official should adjust the damage amount by the rate payable on notes or bonds issued by the United States Treasury with a maturity date that approximates the length of time estimated to complete expenditures for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.
