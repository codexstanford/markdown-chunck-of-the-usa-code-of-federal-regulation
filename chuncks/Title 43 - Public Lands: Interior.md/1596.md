###### Obligations.

(b)(1) A recipient shall operate any program or activity involving Historic Preservation Programs so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing historic properties or every part of an historic property accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons. Methods of achieving accessibility include:

(i) Making physical alterations which enable qualified handicapped persons to have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;

(ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;

(iii) Assigning persons to guide qualified handicapped persons into or through otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;

(iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve accessibility.

(2) Where accessibility cannot be achieved without causing a substantial impairment of significant historic features, the Secretary may grant a waiver of the accessibility requirement. In determining whether accessibility can be achieved without causing a substantial impairment, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:

(i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;

(ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private purpose;

(iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the conduct of the program or activity; and,

(iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in accessibility.
