(b) Where the permittee receives a right to use a road constructed or acquired by the United States, which road is under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, the permittee will be required to pay to the United States a fee to be determined by the authorized officer who may also fix the rate at which payments shall be made by the permittee during his use of the road. The authorized officer shall base his determination upon the amortization of the replacement costs for a road of the type involved, together with a reasonable interest allowance on such costs plus costs of maintenance if furnished by the United States and any extraordinary costs peculiar to the construction or acquisition of the particular road. In the case of federally acquired or constructed access roads, an allowance representing a reasonable allocation for recreational or other authorized uses shall be deducted from the replacement costs of the road before the amortization item is computed. A similar allowance and deduction shall be made in cases involving roads constructed as a part of a timber sale contract when, and if, subsequent to completion of such contract any such road becomes subject to recreational or other authorized uses. In arriving at the amortization item, the authorized officer shall take into account the probable period of time, past and present, during which such road may be in existence, and the volume of timber which has been moved, and the volume of timber currently merchantable which probably will be moved from all sources over such road:That this subdivision shall not apply where the permittee transports forest products purchased from the United States through the Bureau of Land Management, or where payment for such road use to another permittee is required under this subpart 2812:That where the United States is entitled to charge a fee for the use of a road, the authorized officer may waive such fee if the permittee grants to the United States and its licensees the right to use, without charge, permittee's roads of approximately equal value as determined under the methods provided in this subdivision and ยง 2812.4-1(b), as may be applicable.
