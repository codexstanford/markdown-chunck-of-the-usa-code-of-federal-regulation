###### The effect of a master contractor's and subcontractor's actions to conform to the discretionary provisions.

(d)If a district provides irrigation water to other districts through subcontracts and the master contracting district is subject to:

(1) The discretionary provisions, then all subcontracting districts who are entitled to receive irrigation water must also conform to the discretionary provisions; or

(2) Prior law, then the subcontracting district can amend its subcontract to conform to the discretionary provisions without subjecting the master contractor or any other subcontractor of the master contractor to the discretionary provisions. If a subcontract that does not include the United States as a party is amended to conform to the discretionary provisions, or the subcontract is a new or renewed contract executed after October 12, 1982, then the amended, new, or renewed subcontract must include the United States as a party.
