######## ยง 3137.131 What happens if the unit terminated before the unit operator met the initial development obligations?

If the unit terminated before the unit operator met the initial development obligations, BLM's approval of the unit agreement is revoked. You, as lessee, forfeit all further benefits, including extensions and suspensions, granted any NPR-A lease because of having been committed to the unit. Any lease that the BLM extended because of being committed to the unit would expire unless it had been granted an extension or renewal under ยง 3135.1-5 or ยง 3135.1-6.
