###### Working collection

means collections that, while still Federal property, are not intended for long-term preservation and care as museum property since they do not further paleontological knowledge, public education, or management of paleontological resources. Working collections are intended for use during education or ongoing research and may be consumed during the analysis process according to bureau policy. Some specimens and items may subsequently be designated museum property. Working collections may be discarded when it is determined there is no longer a need for the collection for future research or education or upon completion of the ongoing research according to standards set in bureau policy.
