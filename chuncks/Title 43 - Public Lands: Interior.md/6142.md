(i)(1) The operator must report to the AO all meter-proving and volume adjustments after any LACT system or CMS malfunction, including excessive meter-factor deviation, using the appropriate form in either API 12.2.3 or API 5.6 (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 3174.3), or any similar format showing the same information as the API form, provided that the calculation of meter factors maintains the proper calculation sequence and rounding.

(i) Unique meter ID number;

(ii) Lease number, CA number, or unit PA number;

(iii) The temperature from the test thermometer and the temperature from the temperature averager or temperature transducer;

(iv) For pressure transducers, the pressure applied by the pressure test device and the pressure reading from the pressure transducer at the three points required under paragraph (g)(3) of this section;

(v) For density verification (if applicable), the instantaneous flowing density (as determined by Coriolis meter), and the independent density measurement, as compared under paragraph (h) of this section; and

(vi) The "as left" fluid flow rate and fluid pressure, if the back pressure valve is adjusted after proving as described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.
