######## Kind of timber which may be cut.

(b)The proper protection of the timber and undergrowth necessarily varies with the nature of the topography, soil, and forest. No timber not matured may be cut, and each tree taken must be utilized for some beneficial domestic purpose. Persons taking timber for specific purposes will be required to take only such matured trees as will work up to such purpose without unreasonable waste. Stumps will be cut so as to cause the least possible waste and all trees will be utilized to as low a diameter in the tops as possible. All brush, tops, logs, and other forest debris made in felling and removing timber under this section shall be disposed of as best adapted to the protection of the remaining growth and in such manner as shall be prescribed by the authorized officer, and failure on the part of the applicant, or an agent cutting for an applicant, to comply with this requirement will render him liable for all expenses incurred by the authorized officer in putting this regulation into effect.
