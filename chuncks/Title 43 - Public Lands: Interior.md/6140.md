####### ยง 3174.11 Meter-proving requirements.
######## Verification of the pressure transducer (if applicable).

(g)(1) As part of each required meter proving and upon replacement, the pressure transducer must be compared with a test pressure device (dead weight or pressure gauge) traceable to NIST and with a stated maximum uncertainty of no more than one-half of the accuracy required from the transducer being verified.

(2) The pressure reading displayed on the pressure transducer must be compared with the reading of the test pressure device.

(3) The pressure transducer must be tested at the following three points:

(i) Zero (atmospheric pressure);

(ii) 100 percent of the calibrated span of the pressure transducer; and

(iii) A point that represents the normal flowing pressure through the Coriolis meter.

(4) If the pressure applied by the test pressure device and the pressure displayed on the pressure transducer vary by more than the required accuracy of the pressure transducer, the pressure transducer must be adjusted to read within the stated accuracy of the test pressure device.
