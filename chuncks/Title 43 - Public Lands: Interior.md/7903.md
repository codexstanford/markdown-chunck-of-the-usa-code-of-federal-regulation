######## Access routes.

(g)No new access routes that would cause more than temporary impact and therefore would impair wilderness suitability shall be constructed in a wilderness study area. Temporary access routes that are constructed by the operator shall be constructed and maintained to assure adequate drainage and to control or prevent damage to soil, water, and other resource values. Unless otherwise approved by the authorized officer, roads no longer needed for operations shall be closed to normal vehicular traffic; bridges and culverts shall be removed; cross drains, dips, or water bars shall be constructed, and the road surface shall be shaped to as near a natural contour as practicable, be stabilized and revegetated as required in the plan of operations.
