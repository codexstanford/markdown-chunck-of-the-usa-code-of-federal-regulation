(3) The determination of uncertainty is based on the values of flowing parameters (differential pressure, static pressure, and flowing temperature for differential meters or velocity, mass flow rate, or volumetric flow rate for linear meters) determined as follows, listed in order of priority:

(i) The average flowing parameters listed on the most recent daily QTR, if available to the BLM at the time of uncertainty determination; or

(ii) The average flowing parameters from the previous day, as required under ยง 3175.101(b)(4)(i) through (iii) (for differential meters).

(4) The uncertainty must be calculated under API 14.3.1, Section 12 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3175.30) or other methods approved by the AO.
