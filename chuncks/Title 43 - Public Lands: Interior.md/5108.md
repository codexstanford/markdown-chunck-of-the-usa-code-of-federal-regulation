####### ยง 2812.4-2 Compensation payable by United States to permittee for use of road.
######## Provided, however,

In the event the United States itself removes forest products over any road or right-of-way of the permittee or his successor in interest, the United States, if there has been no agreement under ยง 2812.3-7 covering the matter, shall pay to the permittee or his successor in interest reasonable compensation as determined by the State Director, who shall base his determination upon the same standards established by this paragraph for arbitrators in the determination of the compensation to be paid by a licensee to a permittee:That no bond or other security or liability insurance is to be required of the United States. When the United States constructs or improves a road on a permittee's land or right-of-way it shall pay to the permittee the full value at current stumpage prices of all timber of the permittee cut, removed, or destroyed in the construction or maintenance of such road or road improvements. Current stumpage prices shall be determined by the application of the standard appraisal formula, used in appraising O. and C. timber for sale, to the volume and grade of timber. Such volume and grade shall be determined by a cruise made by the permittee or, at his request, by the authorized officer. If either the permittee or the authorized officer does not accept the cruise made by the other, the volume and grade shall be determined by a person or persons acceptable both to the permittee and the State Director.
