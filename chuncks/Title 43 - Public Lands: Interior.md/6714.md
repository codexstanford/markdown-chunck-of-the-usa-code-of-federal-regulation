####### ยง 3261.22 How do I get approval for subsequent well operations?

Send BLM a Sundry Notice describing your proposed operation. For some routine work, such as cleanouts, surveys, or general maintenance (see ยง 3264.11(b)), we may waive the Sundry Notice requirement. Contact your local BLM office to ask about waivers for subsequent well operations. Unless you receive a waiver, you must submit a Sundry Notice. Do not start your operations until we grant a waiver or approve the Sundry Notice.
