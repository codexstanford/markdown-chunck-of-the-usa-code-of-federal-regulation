(11) Certify your compliance with all requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, (42 U.S.C. 11001), when you receive, assign, renew, amend, or terminate your grant;

(12) Control and remove any release or discharge of hazardous material on or near the right-of-way arising in connection with your use and occupancy of the right-of-way, whether or not the release or discharge is authorized under the grant. You must also remediate and restore lands and resources affected by the release or discharge to the BLM's satisfaction and to the satisfaction of any other Federal, State, tribal, or local agency having jurisdiction over the land, resource, or hazardous material;

(13) Comply with all liability and indemnification provisions and stipulations in the grant;

(14) As the BLM directs, provide diagrams or maps showing the location of any constructed facility;

(15) As the BLM directs, provide, or give access to, any pertinent environmental, technical, and financial records, reports, and other information, such as Power Purchase and Interconnection Agreements or the production and sale data for electricity generated from the approved facilities on public lands. Failure to comply with such requirements may, at the discretion of the BLM, result in suspension or termination of the right-of-way authorization. The BLM may use this and similar information for the purpose of monitoring your authorization and for periodic evaluation of financial obligations under the authorization, as appropriate. Any records the BLM obtains will be made available to the public subject to all applicable legal requirements and limitations for inspection and duplication under the Freedom of Information Act. Any information marked confidential or proprietary will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law; and

(16) Comply with all other stipulations that the BLM may require.

(b) You must comply with the bonding requirements under § 2805.20. The BLM will not issue a Notice to Proceed or give written approval to proceed with ground disturbing activities until you comply with this requirement.

(c) By accepting a grant or lease for solar or wind energy development, you also agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. You must:

(1) Not begin any ground disturbing activities until the BLM issues a Notice to Proceed (see § 2807.10) or written approval to proceed with ground disturbing activities;

(2) Complete construction within the timeframes in the approved POD, but no later than 24 months after the start of construction, unless the project has been approved for staged development, or as otherwise authorized by the BLM;

(3) If an approved POD provides for staged development, unless otherwise approved by the BLM:

(i) Begin construction of the initial phase of development within 12 months after issuance of the Notice to Proceed, but no later than 24 months after the effective date of the right-of-way authorization;

(ii) Begin construction of each stage of development (following the first) within 3 years of the start of construction of the previous stage of development, and complete construction of that stage no later than 24 months after the start of construction of that stage, unless otherwise authorized by the BLM; and

(iii) Have no more than 3 development stages, unless otherwise authorized by the BLM;

(4) Maintain all onsite electrical generation equipment and facilities in accordance with the design standards in the approved POD;

(5) Repair and place into service, or remove from the site, damaged or abandoned facilities that have been inoperative for any continuous period of 3 months and that present an unnecessary hazard to the public lands. You must take appropriate remedial action within 30 days after receipt of a written noncompliance notice, unless you have been provided an extension of time by the BLM. Alternatively, you must show good cause for any delays in repairs, use, or removal; estimate when corrective action will be completed; provide evidence of diligent operation of the facilities; and submit a written request for an extension of the 30-day deadline. If you do not comply with this provision, the BLM may suspend or terminate the authorization under §§ 2807.17 through 2807.19; and

(6) Comply with the diligent development provisions of the authorization or the BLM may suspend or terminate your grant or lease under §§ 2807.17 through 2807.19. Before suspending or terminating the authorization, the BLM will send you a notice that gives you a reasonable opportunity to correct any noncompliance or to start or resume use of the right-of-way (see § 2807.18). In response to this notice, you must:

(i) Provide reasonable justification for any delays in construction (for example, delays in equipment delivery, legal challenges, and acts of God);

(ii) Provide the anticipated date of completion of construction and evidence of progress toward the start or resumption of construction; and

(iii) Submit a written request under paragraph (e) of this section for extension of the timelines in the approved POD. If you do not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the BLM may deny your request for an extension of the timelines in the approved POD.

(7) In addition to the RCE requirements of § 2805.20(a)(5) for a grant, the bond secured for a grant or lease must cover the estimated costs of cultural resource and Indian cultural resource identification, protection, and mitigation for project impacts.

(d) For energy site or project testing grants:

(1) You must install all monitoring facilities within 12 months after the effective date of the grant or other authorization. If monitoring facilities under a site testing and monitoring right-of-way authorization have not been installed within 12 months after the effective date of the authorization or consistent with the timeframe of the approved POD, you must request an extension pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;

(2) You must maintain all onsite equipment and facilities in accordance with the approved design standards;

(3) You must repair and place into service, or remove from the site, damaged or abandoned facilities that have been inoperative for any continuous period of 3 months and that present an unnecessary hazard to the public lands; and

(4) If you do not comply with the diligent development provisions of either the site testing and monitoring authorization or the project testing and monitoring authorization, the BLM may terminate your authorization under § 2807.17.
