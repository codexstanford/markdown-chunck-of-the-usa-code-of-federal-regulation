###### U.S.D.I. Bureau of Reclamation.

(2)Prior to the Act, the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) had the responsibility for implementing mitigation measures associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah. Section 301(a)(1) of the Act granted authority to the Commission "to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and conservation provisions of this Act." Section 301(n) further transferred from the Bureau to the Commission "the responsibility for implementing Section 8 funds for mitigation and conservation projects and features authorized in this Act." While the Act therefore clearly transfers mitigation responsibilities concerning the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project from the Bureau to the Commission, it does not alter the Bureau's mitigation responsibilities with respect to other components of the Colorado River Storage Project or other Federal reclamation projects in Utah. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the Bureau:

(i) The Commission recognizes that the Bureau and the Commission share fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation responsibilities associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah and is committed to maintaining a strong and productive partnership with the Bureau in this regard.

(ii) Except for those features that the Secretary has assigned to others in allocating the $214,352,000 increase in CRSP authorization specified in Section 201(a) of the Act, the Commission has the primary authority and responsibility for all mitigation projects involving use of Section 8 funds for the Bonneville Unit and for alternative formulations of the Uintah and Upalco units of the Central Utah Project, and all mitigation projects identified in Section 315 of the Act, or as modified in the plan.

(iii) The Bureau retains the responsibility and primary authority to undertake fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation activities for Federal reclamation projects in Utah other than those as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section wherein the Bureau acts at the direction of the Commission. The Commission also has the authority to undertake selective fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation activities concerning these same projects, as authorized in Section 315 of the Act or in the plan. The Commission will actively consult with the Bureau with regard to potential mitigation or enhancement activities in those areas in order to ensure that Bureau and Commission mitigation activities are coordinated.

(iv) The Bureau retains responsibility for implementation of fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures associated with Federal reclamation projects in Utah that were initiated prior to the establishment of the Act where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.

(v) The Bureau retains responsibility for operation, maintenance, and replacement of facilities related to fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures undertaken by the Bureau where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.

(vi) The Bureau retains responsibility for mitigating future impacts to fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by operation, maintenance, and replacement of water resource development facilities where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.

(vii) The Commission has no responsibility or authority for mitigation or replacement measures associated with Federal reclamation projects in Utah that are not related to fish, wildlife, and recreation.
