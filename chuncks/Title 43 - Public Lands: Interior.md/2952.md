###### Non-powered hand tools

(5)means tools that do not use or are not operated by a motor, engine, or other mechanized power source, and that can be hand-carried by one person.

(b) In order to preserve paleontological or other resources, or for other management reasons, the Federal land manager may establish area-specific limits on casual collecting, including, but not limited to, restricting the weight of common non-vertebrate paleontological resources; limiting the depth of disturbance; establishing dates or locations for collecting; or establishing what paleontological resources in a specific area are not common.

(c) In consultation with knowledgeable paleontologists, the Federal land manager will determine which non-vertebrate paleontological resources are scientifically rare or unique and are therefore not common.

(d) Collecting common non-vertebrate paleontological resources inconsistent with this subpart is a prohibited act and may result in civil or criminal penalties.
