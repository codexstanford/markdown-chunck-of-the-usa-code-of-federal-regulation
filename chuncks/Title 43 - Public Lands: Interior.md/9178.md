(ii) Be supported by implementation plans that have previously been subjected to peer and/or public review,

(iii) Have documented support from affected interests, and/or

(iv) Have a high probability that agency and public support will be sustained into the future. This is especially important for multi-year projects and projects that are part of a larger, long-term initiative.
