######## Hazardous substances,Federal lands.

(j)-(1)The authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances may be present on the Federal lands involved in an exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands to the other parties in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 373. The authorized officer shall provide this notice in the exchange agreement. The authorized officer shall also provide such notice, to the extent information is readily available, in the agreement to initiate an exchange. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), the conveyance document from the United States shall contain a covenant in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into an agreement, as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e), whereby that party would indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless against any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.
