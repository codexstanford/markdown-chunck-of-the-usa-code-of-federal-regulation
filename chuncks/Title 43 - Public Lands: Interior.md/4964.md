######## ยง 2806.38 Can I combine multiple grants or leases for facilities located on one site into a single grant or lease?

If you hold authorizations for two or more facilities on the same site, you can combine all those uses under one grant or lease, with BLM's approval. The highest value use in all the combined facilities determines the base rent. BLM then charges for each remaining use in the combined facilities at 25 percent of the rent from the rent schedule. These uses include those uses we previously calculated as base rents when BLM authorized each of the facilities on an individual basis.
