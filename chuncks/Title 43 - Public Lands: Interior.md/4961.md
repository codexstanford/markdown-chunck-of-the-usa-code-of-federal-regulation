######### see

(b) The facility owner, BLM will follow the provisions in ยง 2806.31 of this subpart to calculate rent for a lease involving these uses. However, we include the rent from the rent schedule for a PMRS, internal microwave, or other use in the rental calculation only if the value of that use is equal to or greater than the value of any other use in the facility. BLM excludes these uses in the 25 percent calculation (ยง 2806.31(a) of this subpart) when their value does not exceed the highest value in the facility.
