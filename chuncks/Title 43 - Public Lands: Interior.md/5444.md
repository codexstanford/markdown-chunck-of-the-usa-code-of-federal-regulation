(2) BLM will notify the Indian mineral owner(s) identified in the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and BIA, and give them a reasonable period of time to state objections to disclosure, using the standards and procedures of ยง 2.15(d) of this title, before making a decision about the applicability of FOIA exemption 4 to:
