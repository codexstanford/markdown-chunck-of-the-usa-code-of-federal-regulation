####### ยง 3871.2 Statement of claim.
######## Provided, however,

(b) In order that the "boundaries" and "extent" of the claim may be shown, it will be incumbent upon the adverse claimant to file a plat showing his entire claim, its relative situation or position with the one against which he claims, and the extent of the conflict:That if the application for patent describes the claim by legal subdivisions, the adverse claimant, if also claiming by legal subdivisions, may describe his adverse claim in the same manner without further survey or plat. If the claim is not described by legal subdivisions it will generally be more satisfactory if the plat thereof is made from an actual survey by a mineral surveyor and its correctness officially certified thereon by him.
