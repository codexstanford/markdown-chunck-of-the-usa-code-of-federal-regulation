(3) If the planned activity is also subject to review under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470), the Federal agency official should coordinate consultation and any subsequent agreement for compliance conducted under that Act with the requirements of § 10.3 (c)(2) and § 10.5.

(4) If an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization receives notice of a planned activity or otherwise becomes aware of a planned activity that may result in the excavation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on tribal lands, the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization may take appropriate steps to:

(i) Ensure that the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are excavated or removed following § 10.3 (b), and

(ii) Make certain that the disposition of any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently as a result of the planned activity are carried out following § 10.6.
