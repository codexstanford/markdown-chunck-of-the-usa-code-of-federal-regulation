###### Bond.

(b)You are responsible for all response, repair and restoration if your activity causes damage to an area.

The amount of the bond or security must be in an amount sufficient to provide full payment for the costs of response and restoration, reclamation, or rehabilitation of the lands in the event that you fail to adequately repair, reclaim, or restore the area as directed by the agency. If the amount of the bond or other security is inadequate to cover cost of the repair, reclamation, or restoration of the damaged lands or resources you will also be responsible for the additional amount.
