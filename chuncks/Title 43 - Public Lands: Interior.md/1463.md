(c)(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). Such recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246, as amended, or any Executive Order which supersedes it.

(2) The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to programs under laws funded or administered by the Department where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs, (ii) to assist such individuals in meeting expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (iii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals. Assistance given under the following laws has one of the above purposes as a primary objective: Water Resources Research Act of 1964, title I, 78 Stat. 329, and those statutes listed in appendix A to this subpart where the facilities or employment opportunities provided are limited, or a preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training or related employment.

(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefit of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
