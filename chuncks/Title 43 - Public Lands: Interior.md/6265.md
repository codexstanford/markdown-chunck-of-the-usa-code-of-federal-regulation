####### ยง 3175.112 Sampling probe and tubing.
######## Location of sample probe.

(b)(1) The sample probe must be located in the meter tube in accordance with API 14.1, Subsection 6.4.2 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3175.30), and must be the first obstruction downstream of the primary device.

(2) The sample probe must be exposed to the same ambient temperature as the primary device. The operator may accomplish this by physically locating the sample probe in the same ambient temperature conditions as the primary device (such as in a heated meter house) or by installing insulation and/or heat tracing along the entire meter run. If the operator chooses to use insulation to comply with this requirement, the AO may prescribe the quality of the insulation based on site specific factors such as ambient temperature, flowing temperature of the gas, composition of the gas, and location of the sample probe in relation to the orifice plate (i.e., inside or outside of a meter house).
