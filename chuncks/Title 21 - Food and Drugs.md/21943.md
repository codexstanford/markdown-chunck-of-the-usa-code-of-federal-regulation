####### Identification.

(a)A preformed crown is a prefabricated device made of plastic or austenitic alloys or alloys containing 75 percent or greater gold and metals of the platinum group intended to be affixed temporarily to a tooth after removal of, or breakage of, the natural crown (that portion of the tooth that normally protrudes above the gums). It is intended for use as a functional restoration until a permanent crown is constructed. The device also may be intended for use as a functional restoration for a badly decayed deciduous (baby) tooth until the adult tooth erupts.
