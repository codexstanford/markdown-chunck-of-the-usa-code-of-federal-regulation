####### Bacterial procedure.

(ii)The liquid egg whites are subjected to the action of a culture of glucose-fermenting bacteria either generally recognized as safe within the meaning of section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the subject of a regulation established pursuant to section 409 of the act, and the culture is used in conformity with such regulation. The quantity of the culture used is sufficient to predominate in the fermentation and the time and temperature of reaction are sufficient to substantially reduce the glucose content.

(c)(1) Dried egg whites in which the lysozyme and avidin have been reduced shall not be nutritionally inferior, as defined in ยง 101.3(e)(4)(i) of this chapter, and shall be considered nutritionally equivalent to untreated egg whites if they meet the conditions that the biological quality of the protein contained is equal to or greater than that of untreated egg white from the same batch of liquid egg white.
