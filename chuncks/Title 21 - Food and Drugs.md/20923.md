####### Identification.

(a)An antimitochondrial antibody immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the antimitochondrial antibodies in human serum. The measurements aid in the diagnosis of diseases that produce a spectrum of autoantibodies (antibodies produced against the body's own tissue), such as primary biliary cirrhosis (degeneration of liver tissue) and chronic active hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).
