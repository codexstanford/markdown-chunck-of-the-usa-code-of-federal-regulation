####### Identification.

(a)A nonabsorbable expandable hemostatic sponge for temporary internal use is a prescription device intended to be placed temporarily into junctional, non-compressible wounds, which are not amenable to tourniquet use, to control bleeding until surgical care is acquired. The sponges expand upon contact with blood to fill the wound cavity and provide a physical barrier and pressure that facilitates formation of a clot. The device consists of sterile, nonabsorbable radiopaque compressed sponges and may include an applicator to facilitate delivery into a wound.
