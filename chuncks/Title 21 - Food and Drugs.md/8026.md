(a) Glucono delta-lactone (CHO, CAS Reg. No. 90-80-2), also called-gluconic acid delta-lactone or-glucono-1,5-lactone, is the cyclic 1,5-intramolecular ester of-gluconic acid. It is prepared by direct crystallization from the aqueous solution of gluconic acid. Gluconic acid may be produced by the oxidation of-glucose with bromine water, by the oxidation of-glucose by microorganisms that are nonpathogenic and nontoxicogenic to man or other animals, or by the oxidation of-glucose with enzymes derived from these microorganisms.
