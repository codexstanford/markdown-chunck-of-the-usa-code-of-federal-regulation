Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:Fit a No. 20 sieve into a No. 100 sieve. Attach bottom pan to the No. 100 sieve. Pour 100 grams of the sample into the No. 20 sieve. Attach cover and hold the assembly in a slightly inclined position with one hand. Shake the sieves by striking the sides against the other hand with an upward stroke, at the rate of about 150 times per minute. Turn the sieves about one-sixth of a revolution, each time in the same direction, after each 25 strokes. Continue shaking for 2 minutes. Weigh the material which fails to pass through the No. 20 sieve and the material which passes through the No. 100 sieve.
