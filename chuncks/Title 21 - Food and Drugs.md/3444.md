###### ยง 101.80 Health claims: dietary noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.
####### Significance of the relationship between noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.

(b)Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners do not promote dental caries. The noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are slowly metabolized by bacteria to form some acid. The rate and amount of acid production is significantly less than that from sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates and does not cause the loss of important minerals from tooth enamel.
