####### Identification.

(a)A high pressure liquid chromatography system for clinical use is a device intended to separate one or more drugs or compounds from a solution by processing the mixture of compounds (solutes) through a column packed with materials of uniform size (stationary phase) under the influence of a high pressure liquid (mobile phase). Separation of the solutes occurs either by absorption, sieving, partition, or selective affinity.
