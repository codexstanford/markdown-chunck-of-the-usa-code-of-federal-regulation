(iii) When retailers provide nutrition labeling information for more than one raw fruit or vegetable on signs or posters or in brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, the listings for saturated fat,fat, and cholesterol may be omitted from the charts or individual nutrition labels if a footnote states that most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of these nutrients, but that avocados contain 0.5 gram (g) of saturated fat per ounce (e.g., "Most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of saturated fat,fat, and cholesterol; avocados provide 0.5 g of saturated fat per ounce"). The footnote also may contain information about the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat content of avocados.
