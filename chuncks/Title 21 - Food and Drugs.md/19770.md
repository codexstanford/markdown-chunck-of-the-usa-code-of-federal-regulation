(1) The manufacturer or importer of the device petitions for reclassification of the device in accordance with ยง 860.123.

(2) Within 30 days after the petition is filed, the Commissioner notifies the petitioner of any deficiencies in the petition that prevent the Commissioner from making a decision on it and allows the petitioner to supplement a deficient petition.
