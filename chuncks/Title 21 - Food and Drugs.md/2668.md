(a)(1) The color additive D&C Yellow No. 10 is a mixture of the sodium salts of the mono- and disulfonic acids of 2-(2-quinolinyl)-1-indene-1,3 (2)-dione consisting principally of the sodium salts of 2-(2,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-1-indene-2-yl)-6-quinolinesulfonic acid and 2-(2,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-1-indene-2-yl)-8-quinolinesulfonic acid with lesser amounts of the disodium salts of the disulfonic acids of 2-(2-quinolinyl)-1-indene-1,3(2)-dione (CAS Reg. No. 8004-92-0). D&C Yellow No. 10 is manufactured by condensing quinaldine with phthalic anhydride to give the unsulfonated dye, which is then sulfonated with oleum.

(2) Color additive mixtures made with D&C Yellow No. 10 for drug use may contain only those diluents that are suitable and that are listed in part 73 of this chapter as safe for use in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs.
