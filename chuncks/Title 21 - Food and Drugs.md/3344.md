####### 2

() Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Cholesterol lowered from 30 mg to 5 mg per serving; contains 13 g of fat per serving.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(3) The terms defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be used on the label and in labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m) provided that the product meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section except that the determination as to whether paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (d)(2)(iii) of this section applies to the product will be made only on the basis of whether the meal product contains 26 g or less of total fat per labeled serving or the main dish product contain 19.5 g or less of total fat per labeled serving, the requirement in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall be limited to 20 mg of cholesterol per 100 g, and the requirement in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section shall be modified to require that the food contain 2 g or less of saturated fat per 100 g rather than per reference amount customarily consumed.

(4) The terms "reduced cholesterol," "reduced in cholesterol," "cholesterol reduced," "less cholesterol," "lower cholesterol," or "lower in cholesterol" except as limited by § 101.13(j)(1)(i) may be used on the label or in labeling of foods or foods that substitute for those foods as specified in § 101.13(d), excluding meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) For foods that contain 13 g or less of total fat per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving, and per 50 g if the reference amount customarily consumed is 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form):

(A) The food has been specifically formulated, altered, or processed to reduce its cholesterol by 25 percent or more from the reference food it resembles as defined in § 101.13(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as specified in § 101.13(d) that has a significant (i.e., 5 percent or more) market share; and

(B) The food contains 2 g or less of saturated fatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed; and

(C) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
