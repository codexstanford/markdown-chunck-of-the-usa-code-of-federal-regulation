It is made from a mixture of di(-octyl)tin dichloride and (-octyl)tin trichloride which has an organotin composition that is not less than 95 percent by weight di(-octyl)tin dichloride/(-octyl)tin trichloride, and not more than 1.5 percent by weight of tri(-octyl)tin chloride. The alkyl radical in the mercaptoacetate is derived from a mixture of saturated-alcohols which has a composition that is not less than 50 percent by weight tetradecyl alcohol, and that is not more than 50 percent by weight total of decyl alcohol and/or dodecyl alcohol, and/or hexadecyl alcohol.
