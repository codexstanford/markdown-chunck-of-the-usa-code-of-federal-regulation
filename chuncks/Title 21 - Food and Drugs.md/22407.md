####### Identification.

(a)A urethral insert with pump for bladder drainage is a catheter-like device with internal pump mechanism that is placed in the urethra. Under patient control the internal pump draws urine out of the bladder when voiding is desired, and blocks urine flow when continence is desired. The device is intended for use by women who cannot empty their bladder due to impaired detrusor contractility.
