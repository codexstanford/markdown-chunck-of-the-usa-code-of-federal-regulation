####### Identification.

(a)Dengue virus nucleic acid amplification test reagents are devices that consist of primers, probes, enzymes, and controls for the amplification and detection of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, or 4 from viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in human serum and plasma from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with dengue (mild or severe). The identification of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, or 4 in human serum and plasma (sodium citrate) collected from human patients with dengue provides epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating dengue viruses.
