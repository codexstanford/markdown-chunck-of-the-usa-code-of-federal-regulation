(C) The emission spectrum must be determined using a handheld radiometer with a response weighted to match the spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E entitled "Erythemal reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose," dated 1999 (First edition, 1999-12-15; corrected and reprinted 2000-11-15), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
