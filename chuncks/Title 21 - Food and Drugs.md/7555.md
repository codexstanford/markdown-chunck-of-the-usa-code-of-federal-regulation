(1) Di(-octyl)tin S,S&#x2032;-bis(isooctylmercaptoacetate) is an octyltin chemical having 15.1 to 16.4 percent by weight of tin (Sn) and having 8.1 to 8.9 percent by weight of mercapto sulfur. It is made from di(-octyl)tin dichloride or di(-octyl)tin oxide. The isooctyl radical in the mercaptoacetate is derived from oxo process isooctyl alcohol. Di(-octyl)tin dichloride has an organotin composition that is not less than 95 percent by weight of di(-octyl)tin dichloride and not more than 5 percent by weight of tri(-octyl)tin chloride. Di(-octyl)tin oxide has an organotin composition that is not less than 95 percent by weight of di(-octyl)tin oxide and not more than 5 percent by weight of bis[tri(-octyl)tin] oxide, and/or mono-octyltin oxide.
