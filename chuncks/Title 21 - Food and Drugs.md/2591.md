####### Identity.

(a)(1) The color additive D&C Red No. 22 is principally the disodium salt of 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;7&#x2032;-tetrabromofluorescein (CAS Reg. No. 17372-87-1) and may contain smaller amounts of the disodium salts of 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-tribromofluorescein and 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,7&#x2032;-tribromofluorescein. The color additive is manufactured by alkaline hydrolysis of 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;,7&#x2032;-tetrabromofluorescein. 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;,7&#x2032;-Tetrabromofluorescein is manufactured by brominating fluorescein with elemental bromine. The fluorescein is manufactured by the acid condensation of resorcinol and phthalic acid or its anhydride. Fluorescein is isolated and partially purified prior to bromination.

(2) Color additive mixtures for drug use made with Red No. 22 may contain only those diluents that are suitable and that are listed in part 73 of this chapter as safe for use in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs.
