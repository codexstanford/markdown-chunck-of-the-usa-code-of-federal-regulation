####### Automatic exposure control performance.

(i)(A) The AEC shall be capable of maintaining film optical density within +/-0.30 of the mean optical density when thickness of a homogeneous material is varied over a range of 2 to 6 cm and the kVp is varied appropriately for such thicknesses over the kVp range used clinically in the facility. If this requirement cannot be met, a technique chart shall be developed showing appropriate techniques (kVp and density control settings) for different breast thicknesses and compositions that must be used so that optical densities within +/-0.30 of the average under phototimed conditions can be produced.

(B) After October 28, 2002, the AEC shall be capable of maintaining film optical density (OD) within +/-0.15 of the mean optical density when thickness of a homogeneous material is varied over a range of 2 to 6 cm and the kVp is varied appropriately for such thicknesses over the kVp range used clinically in the facility.

(C) The optical density of the film in the center of the phantom image shall not be less than 1.20.
