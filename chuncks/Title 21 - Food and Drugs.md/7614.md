(4) Ultraviolet absorbance limits specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as determined by the analytical method described therein.

(c) The polyhydric alcohol esters of oxidatively refined (Gersthofen process) montan wax acids, identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, may also be used as a component of an aqueous dispersion of vinylidene chloride copolymers, subject to the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The aqueous dispersion of the additive contains not more that 18 percent polyhydric alcohol esters of oxidatively refined (Gersthofen process) montan wax acids, not more than 2 percent poly(oxyethylene) (minimum 20 moles of ethylene oxide) oleyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 9004-98-2), and not more than 1 percent poly(oxyethylene) (minimum 3 moles ethylene oxide) cetyl alcohols (CAS Reg. No. 9004-95-9).

(2) The aqueous dispersion described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is used as an additive to aqueous dispersions of vinylidene chloride copolymers, regulated in §§ 175.300, 175.320, 175.360, 176.170, 176,180, and 177.1630 of this chapter, at levels not to exceed 1.5 percent (solids basis) in the finished coating.

(d) The polyhydric alcohol esters identified in this paragraph may be used as lubricants in the fabrication of vinyl chloride plastic food contact articles prepared from vinyl chloride polymers. Such esters meet the following specifications and are produced by partial esterification of oxidatively refined (Gersthofen process) montan wax acids with glycerol followed by neutralization:

(1) Dropping point 79 to 85 &#xB0;C, as determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Method D-566-76 (Reapproved 1982), "Standard Test Method for Dropping Point of Lubricating Grease," which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(2) Acid value 20-30, as determined by ASTM Method D-1386-78 "Standard Test Method for Acid Number (Empirical) of Synthetic and Natural Waxes" (Revised 1978) (which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a); the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), using as a solvent xylene-ethyl alcohol in a 2:1 ratio instead of toluene-ethyl alcohol in a 2:1 ratio.

(3) Saponification value 130-160, as determined by ASTM Method D-1387-78 "Standard Test Method for Saponification Number (Empirical) of Synthetic and Natural Waxes" (Revised 1978), (which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a); the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), using xylene-ethyl alcohol in a 2:1 ratio instead of ethyl alcohol in the preparation of potassium hydroxide solution.

(4) Ultraviolet absorbance limits specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as determined by the analytical method described therein.
