####### Spray method.

(ii)To prepare the spray, mix drug with water according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. Apply to the point of "runoff," about 1 gallon of diluted spray per adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.
