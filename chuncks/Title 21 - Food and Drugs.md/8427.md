####### Boxed warning.

(1)Certain contraindications or serious warnings, particularly those that may lead to death or serious injury, may be required by the FDA to be presented in a box. The boxed warning ordinarily must be based on clinical data, but serious animal toxicity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. The box must contain, in uppercase letters, a heading inside the box that includes the word "WARNING" and conveys the general focus of the information in the box. The box must briefly explain the risk and refer to more detailed information in the "Contraindications" or "Warnings and Precautions" section, accompanied by the identifying number for the section or subsection containing the detailed information.
