####### Identification.

(a)A scleral plug is a prescription device intended to provide temporary closure of a scleral incision during an ophthalmic surgical procedure. These plugs prevent intraocular fluid and pressure loss when instruments are withdrawn from the eye. Scleral plugs include a head portion remaining above the sclera, which can be gripped for insertion and removal, and a shaft that fits inside the scleral incision. Scleral plugs are removed before completing the surgery.
