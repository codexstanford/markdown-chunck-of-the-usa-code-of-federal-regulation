###### Kerma

means the quantity as defined by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. The kerma, K, is the quotient of dEby dm, where dEis the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged particles in a mass dm of material; thus K = dE/dm, in units of J/kg, where the special name for the unit of kerma is gray (Gy). When the material is air, the quantity is referred to as "air kerma."
