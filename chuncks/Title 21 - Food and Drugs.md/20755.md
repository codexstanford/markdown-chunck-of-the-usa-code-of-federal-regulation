####### Identification.

(a)Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in serum. The identification aids in the diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these viruses. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses usually cause a mild cerebral meningitis (inflammation of membranes that envelop the brain) and occasionally a mild pneumonia, but in rare instances may produce severe and even fatal illnesses due to complications from cerebral meningitis and pneumonia.
