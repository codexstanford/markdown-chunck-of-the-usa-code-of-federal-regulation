(a)An in vitro diagnostic device forspecies (spp.) detection is a prescription device used to detect and differentiate amongspp. and presumptively identifyand otherspp. from cultured isolates or clinical specimens as an aid in the diagnosis of anthrax and other diseases caused byspp. This device may consist ofspp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to presumptively identify bacillus-like organisms in clinical specimens; bacteriophage used for differentiatingfrom otherspp. based on susceptibility to lysis by the phage; or antigens used to identify antibodies to(anti-toxin and anti-capsular) in serum. Bacillus infections include anthrax (cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal) caused byand gastrointestinal disease and non-gastrointestinal infections caused by
