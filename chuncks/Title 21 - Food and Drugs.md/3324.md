###### § 101.54 Nutrient content claims for "good source," "high," "more," and "high potency."
####### "More" claims.

(e)(1) A relative claim using the terms "more," "fortified," "enriched," "added," "extra," and "plus" may be used on the label or in labeling of foods to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium, except as limited by § 101.13(j)(1)(i) and except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food; and

(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and

(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than white bread"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Fiber content of white bread is 1 gram (g) per serving; (this product) 3.5 g per serving") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(2) A relative claim using the terms "more," "fortified," "enriched," "added," "extra," and "plus" may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber or potassium, except as limited in § 101.13(j)(1)(i), in meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food.

(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and

(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient was increased relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 oz than does 'X brand of product' "), and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "The fiber content of 'X brand of product' is 2 g per 3 oz. This product contains 4.5 g per 3 oz.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
