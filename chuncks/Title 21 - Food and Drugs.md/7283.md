(2)The finished food-contact article shall have a minimum inherent viscosity of 0.55 deciliter per gram in a solution of 0.1 gram of polymer in 100 milliliters of a 25/40/35 (weight/weight/weight) solution of-chlorophenol/tetrachloroethane/phenol. The viscosity is determined by Eastman Chemical Co.'s method ECD-A-AC-G-V-1-5, "Determination of Dilute Solution Viscosity of Polyesters," dated May 31, 1988, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
