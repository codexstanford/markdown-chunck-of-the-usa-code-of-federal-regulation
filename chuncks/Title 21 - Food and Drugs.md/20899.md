####### Identification.

(a)Immunonephelometer equipment for clinical use with its electrical power supply is a device that measures light scattering from antigen-antibody complexes. The concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. A beam of light passed through a solution is scattered by the particles in suspension. The amount of light is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. The amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. This electrical readout is called the light-scattering value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. This generic type of device includes devices with various kinds of light sources, such as laser equipment.
