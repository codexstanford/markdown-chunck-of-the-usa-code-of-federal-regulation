(a) Orange juice is the unfermented juice obtained from mature oranges of the speciesor of the citrus hybrid commonly called "Ambersweet" (XX(USDA Selection:1-100-29: 1972 Whitmore Foundation Farm)). Seeds (except embryonic seeds and small fragments of seeds that cannot be separated by current good manufacturing practice) and excess pulp are removed. The juice may be chilled, but it is not frozen.

(b) The name of the food is "orange juice". The name "orange juice" may be preceded on the label by the varietal name of the oranges used, and if the oranges grew in a single State, the name of such State may be included in the name, as for example, "California Valencia orange juice".
