####### Design parameters and test data.

(ii)(A) All final design parameters of the product, specifying nominal values or the explicit range of values as well as the design tolerance (where appropriate), including, but not limited to, the parameters specified in tables 1 to 22 of this paragraph as applicable. If a design parameter specified in tables 1 to 22 does not apply to the tobacco product, applicants must explain why the required design parameter does not apply or how an alternative design parameter would satisfy the required design parameter. If the product has additional design parameters that are not specified in tables 1 to 22, the application must contain a description of the design specifications as well as test data and processes to demonstrate that the design parameters and their associated processes are adequately controlled; and

(B) A quantitative description of the performance criteria, including test protocols, line data, and a summary of the results, for each applicable intermediate and final design parameter and manufacturing step, that includes, but is not limited to the test data specified in tables 1 to 22 of this paragraph for the product category as applicable. If the test data specified in the applicable table does not apply to the tobacco product, applicants must explain why the test data does not apply or how alternative test data would satisfy this requirement. Where tobacco cut size or particle size is a required design parameter for a product category or subcategory and the target specifications and range limits are not available, the following alternative information may be submitted in place of this information: a description of the tobacco cutting process (including a complete description of the milling, cutting, and sifting process; the control parameters of the miller or cutter; and any sift specifications), or the measured particle size distribution;
