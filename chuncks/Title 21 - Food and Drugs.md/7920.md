###### ยง 184.1138 Ammonium chloride.

(a) Ammonium chloride (NHCl, CAS Reg. No. 12125-02-9) is produced by the reaction of sodium chloride and an ammonium salt in solution. The less soluble sodium salt separates out at elevated temperatures, and ammonium chloride is recovered from the filtrate on cooling. Alternatively, hydrogen chloride formed by the burning of hydrogen in chlorine is dissolved in water and then reacted with gaseous ammonia. Ammonium chloride is crystallized from the solution.
