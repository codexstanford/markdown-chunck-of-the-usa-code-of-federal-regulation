####### Identification.

(a)An immunoglobulin G (Fc fragment specific) immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the Fc (carbohydrate containing) fragment of immunoglobulin G (resulting from breakdown of immunoglobulin G antibodies) in urine, serum, and other body fluids. Measurement of immunoglobulin G Fc fragments aids in the diagnosis of plasma cell antibody-forming abnormalities, e.g., gamma heavy chain disease.
