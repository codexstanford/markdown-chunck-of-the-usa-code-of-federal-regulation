###### Graphite.

(j)Data have been developed that show the contamination of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not contain PNA's as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite would indicate that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of graphite for use in externally applied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
