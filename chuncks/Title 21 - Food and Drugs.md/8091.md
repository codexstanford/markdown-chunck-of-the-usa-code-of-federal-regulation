###### ยง 184.1431 Magnesium oxide.

(a) Magnesium oxide (MgO, CAS Reg. No. 1309-48-4) occurs naturally as the colorless, crystalline mineral periclase. It is produced either as a bulky white powder (light) or a relatively dense white powder (heavy) by heating magnesium hydroxide or carbonate. Heating these magnesium salts under moderate conditions (400&#xB0; to 900 &#xB0;C for a few hours) produces light magnesium oxide. Heating the salts under more rigorous conditions (1200 &#xB0;C for 12 hours) produces heavy magnesium oxide. Light magnesium oxide is converted to heavy magnesium oxide by sustained heating at high temperatures.
