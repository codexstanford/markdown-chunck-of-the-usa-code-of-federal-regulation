####### e.g.,

(A) A description of situations in which the device may fail or may not operate at its expected performance level (poor image quality or for certain subpopulations), including any limitations in the dataset used to train, test, and tune the algorithm during device development;

(B) The data acquired using the device should only be interpreted by the types of users indicated in the intended use statement; and

(C) Qualified users should employ appropriate procedures and safeguards (e.g., quality control measures, etc.) to assure the validity of the interpretation of images obtained using this device.

(3) Design verification and validation must include:

(i) A detailed description of the device software, including its algorithm and its development, that includes a description of any datasets used to train, tune, or test the software algorithm. This detailed description of the device software must include:

(A) A detailed description of the technical performance assessment study protocols (e.g., regions of interest (ROI) localization study) and results used to assess the device output(s) (e.g., image overlays, image heatmaps, etc.);

(B) The training dataset must include cases representing different pre-analytical variables representative of the conditions likely to be encountered when used as intended (e.g., fixation type and time, histology slide processing techniques, challenging diagnostic cases, multiple sites, patient demographics, etc.);

(C) The number of WSI in an independent validation dataset must be appropriate to demonstrate device accuracy in detecting and localizing ROIs on scanned WSI, and must include subsets clinically relevant to the intended use of the device;

(D) Emergency recovery/backup functions, which must be included in the device design;

(E) System level architecture diagram with a matrix to depict the communication endpoints, communication protocols, and security protections for the device and its supportive systems, including any products or services that are included in the communication pathway; and
