####### Opportunity for a hearing.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, FDA will rescind an order only after notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter.

(2) FDA may rescind a substantially equivalent order prior to notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter if it finds that there is a reasonable probability that continued marketing of the tobacco product presents a serious risk to public health. In that case, FDA will provide the manufacturer an opportunity for a hearing as soon as possible after the rescission.

(3) FDA may rescind a substantially equivalent order without notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter if the applicant has notified the Agency of a mistake in the application, FDA has determined that the mistake is part of the underlying scientific determination of the order which makes the order invalid, and the applicant has agreed that FDA can rescind the order without providing notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter.
