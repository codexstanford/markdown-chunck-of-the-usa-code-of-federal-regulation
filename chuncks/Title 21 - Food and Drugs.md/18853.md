####### Licensed person.

A licensed person is a person as defined in section 201(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that holds a license or degree for the diagnosis, assessment, or treatment of hearing loss; or that holds a license to sell or distribute hearing aids. A person that must meet generally applicable licensing or operating requirements such as annual health and safety inspections, provided the generally applicable licensing or operating requirement is consistent with this section and other applicable requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is not a "licensed person" solely for that reason. A person that represents as a marketer, seller, dispenser, distributor, or customer support representative (or an equivalent description) is not a "licensed person" solely by making such representations.
