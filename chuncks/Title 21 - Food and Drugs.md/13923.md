()For most effective results, severely parasitized animals or those constantly exposed to helminth infection should be re-treated every 2 to 3 weeks. Milk taken from treated animals within 96 hours (8 milkings) after the latest treatment must not be used for food. Do not treat cattle within 3 days of slaughter. For a satisfactory diagnosis, a microscopic fecal examination should be performed prior to worming.
