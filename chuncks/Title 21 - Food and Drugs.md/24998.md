###### Timers.

(2)(i) Means shall be provided to terminate the x-ray exposure automatically by either deenergizing the x-ray source or shuttering the x-ray beam in the event of equipment failure affecting data collection. Such termination shall occur within an interval that limits the total scan time to no more than 110 percent of its preset value through the use of either a backup timer or devices which monitor equipment function. A visible signal shall indicate when the x-ray exposure has been terminated through these means and manual resetting of the CT conditions of operation shall be required prior to the initiation of another scan.

(ii) Means shall be provided so that the operator can terminate the x-ray exposure at any time during a scan, or series of scans under x-ray system control, of greater than one-half second duration. Termination of the x-ray exposure shall necessitate resetting of the CT conditions of operation prior to the initiation of another scan.
