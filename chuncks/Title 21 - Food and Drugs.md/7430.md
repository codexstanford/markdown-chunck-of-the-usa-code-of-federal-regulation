####### Thermogravimetry.

(2)Perfluorocarbon cured elastomers have a major decomposition peak occurring at 490&#xB0; +/-15 &#xB0;C (914 &#xB0;F). Less than 1.5 percent of the elastomers will volatilize below 400 &#xB0;C (752 &#xB0;F) when run under nitrogen at a 10 &#xB0;C or 18 &#xB0;F per minute heating rate using a Du Pont Thermal Analyzer Model 1099 with Model 951 TGA unit or the equivalent.
