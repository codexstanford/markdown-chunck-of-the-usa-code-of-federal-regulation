###### § 101.36 Nutrition labeling of dietary supplements.
####### e.g.,

(8) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements that differ from each other (the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon), the quantitative amounts and percent of Daily Value may be presented as specified in this paragraph in individual nutrition labels or in one aggregate nutrition label as illustrated in paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section.

(9)(i) The quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a "per unit" basis in addition to the "per serving" basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If "per unit" information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the "per serving" information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings.

(ii) Alternatively, if a recommendation is made in other parts of the label that a dietary supplement be consumed more than once per day, the total quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a "per day" basis in addition to the "per serving" basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If "per day" information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the "per serving" information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings and/or be presented in a parenthetical statement as part of the "Serving Size" declaration. A sample illustration for "per day" information in a column format is provided in paragraph (e)(11)(viii) of this section. As illustrated, the additional "Per Day" column heading is followed parenthetically by the number of servings recommended per day in other parts of the label (e.g., "Per Day (3 Caplets)"). When the parenthetical statement format following the "Serving Size" declaration is used as an alternative to the column format, the statement must provide no more than simple instructions regarding how to calculate the "per day" amount for the number of servings per day recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., "Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Multiply amounts by 3 for total daily amount)"). When the parenthetical statement format following the "Serving Size" declaration is used in addition to the column format, the statement must provide no more than a simple declaration of the number of servings recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., "Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Total daily amount: 3 caplets per day)").

(10) In the interest of uniformity of presentation, FDA urges that the information be presented using the graphic specifications set forth in appendix B to part 101, as applicable.

(11) The following sample labels are presented for the purpose of illustration:

(ii) Multiple vitamins for children and adults (excludes Servings Per Container which is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration):

(iv) Dietary supplement containing dietary ingredients with and without RDIs and DRVs:

(12) If space is not adequate to list the required information as shown in the sample labels in paragraph (e)(11) of this section, the list may be split and continued to the right as long as the headings are repeated. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The following sample label illustrates this display:

(f)(1) Compliance with this section will be determined in accordance with § 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(8), (g)(10), and (g)(11), except that the sample for analysis shall consist of a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller, randomly selected to be representative of the lot. The criteria on class I and class II nutrients given in § 101.9(g)(3) and (g)(4) also are applicable to other dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Reasonable excesses over labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice.

(2) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements of this section, FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation in accordance with § 101.9(g)(9). Firms in need of such special allowances shall make their request in writing to the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.

(g) Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(5) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in compliance with § 101.2.

(h) Dietary supplements are subject to the exemptions specified as follows in:

(1) Section 101.9(j)(1) for foods that are offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers (i.e., a retailer) who has annual gross sales or business done in sales to consumers that is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000, and whose labels, labeling, and advertising do not provide nutrition information or make a nutrient content or health claim;

(2) Section 101.9(j)(18) for foods that are low-volume products (that is, they meet the requirements for units sold in § 101.9(j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii)); that, except as provided in § 101.9(j)(18)(iv), are the subject of a claim for an exemption that provides the information required under § 101.9(j)(18)(iv), that is filed before the beginning of the time period for which the exemption is claimed, and that is filed by a person, whether it is the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, that qualifies to claim the exemption under the requirements for average full-time equivalent employees in § 101.9(j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii), and whose labels, labeling, and advertising do not provide nutrition information or make a nutrient content or health claim;

(3) Section 101.9(j)(9) for foods shipped in bulk form that are not for distribution to consumers in such form and that are for use solely in the manufacture of other dietary supplements or that are to be processed, labeled, or repacked at a site other than where originally processed or packed.

(i)(1) Dietary supplements are subject to the special labeling provisions specified in § 101.9(j)(5)(i) for foods other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age.

(2) Section 101.9(j)(13) for foods in small or intermediate-sized packages, except that:

(i) All information within the nutrition label on small-sized packages, which have a total surface area available to labeling of less than 12 square inches, shall be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point;

(ii) All information within the nutrition label on intermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, shall be in type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than 8 dietary ingredients to be listed and on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed.

(iii) When the nutrition information is presented on any panel under § 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(D), the ingredient list shall continue to be located immediately below the nutrition label, or, if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label as specified in § 101.4(g).

(iv) When it is not possible for a small or intermediate-sized package that is enclosed in an outer package to comply with these type size requirements, the type size of the nutrition label on the primary (inner) container may be as small as needed to accommodate all of the required label information provided that the primary container is securely enclosed in outer packaging, the nutrition labeling on the outer packaging meets the applicable type size requirements, and such outer packaging is not intended to be separated from the primary container under conditions of retail sale.

(v) Where there is not sufficient space on a small or intermediate-sized package for a nutrition label that meets minimum type size requirements of 4.5 points if hairlines are used in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the hairlines may be omitted and replaced by a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amounts (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value).

(3) Section 101.9(j)(15) for foods in multiunit food containers;

(4) Section 101.9(j)(16) for foods sold in bulk containers; and
