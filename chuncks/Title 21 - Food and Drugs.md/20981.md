####### Identification.

(a)A haptoglobin immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the haptoglobin (a protein that binds hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells) in serum. Measurement of haptoglobin may aid in the diagnosis of hemolytic diseases (diseases in which the red blood cells rupture and release hemoglobin) related to the formation of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes and certain kidney diseases.
