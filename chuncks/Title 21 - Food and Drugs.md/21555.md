####### e.g.,

(B) The factors (medical imaging dataset, operator) must be identified regarding which were held constant and which were varied during the evaluation, and a description must be provided for the computations and statistical analyses used to evaluate the data.

(4) Human factors evaluation must be performed to evaluate the ability of the user interface and labeling to allow for intended users to correctly use the device and interpret the provided information.

(5) Device labeling must be provided that describes the following:

(i) Warnings that identify anatomy and image acquisition factors that may impact simulation results and provide cautionary guidance for interpretation of the provided simulation results;

(ii) Device simulation inputs and outputs, and key assumptions made in the simulation and determination of simulated outputs; and

(iii) The computational modeling performance of the device for presented simulation outputs, and the supporting evidence for this performance.
