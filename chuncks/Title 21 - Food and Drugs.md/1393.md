###### ยง 20.22 Partial disclosure of records.

(a) If a record contains both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the remaining record will be disclosed unless the two are so inextricably intertwined that it is not feasible to separate them or release of the disclosable information would compromise or impinge upon the nondisclosable portion of the record.

(b)(1) Whenever information is deleted from a record that contains both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the portion of the record that is made available, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act.

(2) When technically feasible, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.

(3) The exemption(s) under which the information has been deleted shall be noted at the site of the deletion.
