###### Referral,Determination.

(b)-(1)When ONDCP believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, ONDCP will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the agency processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
