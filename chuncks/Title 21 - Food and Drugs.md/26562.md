### PART 1312 - IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
#### Importation of Controlled Substances
##### ยง 1312.18 Import declaration.

(a) Any non-narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III, IV, or V, not subject to the requirement of an import permit pursuant to ยง 1312.13 (b) or (c) of this chapter, may be imported if that substance is needed for medical, scientific or other legitimate uses in the United States, and will be imported pursuant to a controlled substances import declaration.

(b) Any person registered or authorized to import and seeking to import any non-narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedules III, IV, or V which is not subject to the requirement of an import permit as described in paragraph (a) of this section, must file a controlled substances import declaration (DEA Form 236) with the Administration through the DEA Diversion Control Division secure network application not later than 15 calendar days prior to the anticipated date of release by a customs officer and distribute an official record of the declaration as hereinafter directed in ยง 1312.19. The declaration must be signed and dated by the importer and must specify the address of the final destination for the shipment, which must be the importer's registered location. Upon receipt and review, the Administration will assign a transaction identification number to each completed declaration. The import declaration is not deemed filed, and therefore is not valid, until the Administration has issued a transaction identification number. The importer may only proceed with the import transaction once the transaction identification number has been issued.

(c) DEA Form 236 must include the following information:

(1) The name, address, and registration number of the importer; and the name and address and registration number of the import broker, if any; and

(2) A complete description of the controlled substances to be imported, including drug name, dosage form, National Drug Code (NDC) number, the Administration Controlled Substances Code Number as set forth in part 1308 of this chapter, the number and size of packages or containers, the name and quantity of the controlled substance contained in any finished dosage units, and the net quantity of any controlled substance (expressed in anhydrous acid, base, or alkaloid) given in kilograms or parts thereof; and

(3) The anticipated date of release by a customs officer at the port of entry, the foreign port and country of exportation to the United States, the port of entry, and the name, address, and registration number of the recipient in the United States; and

(4) The name and address of the consignor in the foreign country of exportation, and any registration or license numbers if the consignor is required to have such numbers either by the country of exportation or under U.S. law.

(d) Notwithstanding the time limitations included in paragraph (b) of this section, an applicant may obtain a special waiver of these time limitations in emergency or unusual instances, provided that a specific confirmation is received from the Administrator or his delegate advising the registrant to proceed pursuant to the special waiver.
