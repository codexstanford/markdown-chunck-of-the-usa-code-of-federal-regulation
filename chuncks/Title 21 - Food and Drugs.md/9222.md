##### Subpart A - General Provisions

####### Section 804 Importation Program Sponsor ("SIP Sponsor")

means a State or Indian Tribe that regulates wholesale drug distribution and the practice of pharmacy that submits a proposal to FDA that describes a program to facilitate the importation of prescription drugs from Canada under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and is responsible for oversight of the implementation of the program. After an initial 2-year period beginning on the date of the first import entry under any SIP authorized under this part, the Secretary may determine, based on experience under the program, that there is a sufficient likelihood that a proposal that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP sponsor could provide the same level of assurance of safety as a proposal that does include such a sponsor, such that FDA may begin receiving, reviewing, and potentially authorizing applications for SIPs without such a sponsor. After the Secretary makes such a determination, a pharmacist or wholesaler may propose a SIP that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as a sponsor, and FDA may authorize such a SIP if the sponsor demonstrates that the SIP meets the criteria for authorization with the same level of assurance of safety as a proposal that includes a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP sponsor, which FDA shall evaluate consistent with any considerations described in the Secretary's determination, including by evaluating whether the application demonstrates that the proposed sponsor has sufficient relevant experience, such as participating in a SIP and demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and this part.
