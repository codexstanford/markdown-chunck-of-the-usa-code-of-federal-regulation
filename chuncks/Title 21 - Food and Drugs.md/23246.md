####### Identification.

(a)An implanted neuromuscular stimulator is a device that provides electrical stimulation to a patient's peroneal or femoral nerve to cause muscles in the leg to contract, thus improving the gait in a patient with a paralyzed leg. The stimulator consists of an implanted receiver with electrodes that are placed around a patient's nerve and an external transmitter for transmitting the stimulating pulses across the patient's skin to the implanted receiver. The external transmitter is activated by a switch in the heel in the patient's shoe.
