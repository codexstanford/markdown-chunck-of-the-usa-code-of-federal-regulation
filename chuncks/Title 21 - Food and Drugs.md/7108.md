(ii) Intrinsic viscosity in acetonitrile at 25 &#xB0;C is not less than 0.29 deciliter per gram as determined by ASTM method D1243-79, "Standard Test Method for Dilute Solution Viscosity of Vinyl Chloride Polymers," which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(iii) Residual acrylonitrile monomer content is not more than 11 parts per million as determined by gas chromatography.

(iv) Acetonitrile-soluble fraction after refluxing the base polymer in acetonitrile for 1 hour is not greater than 95 percent by weight of the basic copolymers.
