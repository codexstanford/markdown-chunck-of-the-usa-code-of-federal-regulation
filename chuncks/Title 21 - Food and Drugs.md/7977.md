###### ยง 184.1259 Cocoa butter substitute.

(a) The common or usual name for the triglyceride 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin is "cocoa butter substitute primarily from palm oil." The common or usual name for the triglyceride 1-3-distearoyl-2-olein is "cocoa butter substitute primarily from high-oleic safflower or sunflower oil."

(1) The ingredient 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin is manufactured by:

(i) Directed esterification of fully saturated 1,3-diglycerides (derived from palm oil) with the anhydride of food-grade oleic acid in the presence of the catalyst trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (ยง 173.395 of this chapter), or

(ii) By interesterification of partially saturated 1,2,3-triglycerides (derived from palm oil) with ethyl stearate in the presence of a suitable lipase enzyme preparation that is either generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or has food additive approval for such use.

(2) The ingredient 1-3-distearoyl-2-olein is manufactured by interesterification of partially unsaturated 1,2,3-triglycerides (derived from high-oleic safflower or sunflower oil) with ethyl stearate or stearic acid in the presence of a suitable lipase enzyme preparation that is either GRAS or has food additive approval for such use.

(b) The ingredient meets the following specifications:

(1) Over 90 percent triglycerides, not more than 7 percent diglycerides, not more than 1 percent monoglycerides, and not more than 1 percent free fatty acids.

(2) Total glycerides-98 percent minimum.
