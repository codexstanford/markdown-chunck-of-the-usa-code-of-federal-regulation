(a) White corn meal is the food prepared by so grinding cleaned white corn that when tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section not less than 95 percent passes through a No. 12 sieve, not less than 45 percent through a No. 25 sieve, but not more than 35 percent through a No. 72 grits gauze. Its moisture content is not more than 15 percent. In its preparation coarse particles of the ground corn may be separated and discarded, or reground and recombined with all or part of the material from which they were separated, but in any such case the crude fiber content of the finished corn meal is not less than 1.2 percent and not more than that of the cleaned corn from which it was ground, and its fat content does not differ more than 0.3 percent from that of such corn. The contents of crude fiber and fat in all the foregoing provisions relating thereto are on a moisture-free basis.
