###### ยง 101.54 Nutrient content claims for "good source," "high," "more," and "high potency."
####### Nutrient content claims using the term "antioxidant."

(g)A nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food may be used on the label or in the labeling of that food when:

(1) An RDI has been established for each of the nutrients;

(2) The nutrients that are the subject of the claim have recognized antioxidant activity; that is, when there exists scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions;

(3) The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim is sufficient to qualify for the ยง 101.54 (b), (c), or (e) claim (e.g., to bear the claim "high in antioxidant vitamin C," the product must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C). Beta-carotene may be a subject of the claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, for the claim "good source of antioxidant beta-carotene," 10 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per reference amount customarily consumed; and

(4) The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim are included as part of the claim (e.g., "high in antioxidant vitamins C and E"). Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term "antioxidant" or "antioxidants" (as in "high in antioxidants") may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. The list of nutrients shall appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger of one-half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim orinch.
