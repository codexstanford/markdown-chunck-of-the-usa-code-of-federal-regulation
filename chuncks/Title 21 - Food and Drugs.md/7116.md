(11) Nylon 12T resins are manufactured by the condensation oflaurolactam (CAS Reg. No. 0947-04-6), isophthalic acid (CAS Reg. No. 0121-91-5), and bis(4-amino-3-methylcycl-ohexyl)methane (CAS Reg. No. 6864-37-5) such that the composition in terms of ingredients is 34.4+/-1.5 weight percent-laurolactam, 26.8+/-0.4 weight percent isophthalic acid, and 38.8+/-0.5 weight percent bis(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)-methane.

(12) Nylon 6I/6T resins (CAS Reg. No. 25750-23-6) are manufactured by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine, terephthalic acid, and isophthalic acid such that 65 to 80 percent of the polymer units are derived from hexamethylene isophthalamide.
