###### ยง 1114.17 Resubmissions.
####### General.

(a)An applicant may, as an alternative format of submitting an application that meets the content requirements of ยง 1114.7 or 1114.15 (if applicable), submit a resubmission to address deficiencies set forth in a marketing denial order. The resubmission must contain new information necessary to address application deficiencies and cross-reference applicable content from the PMTA that received the marketing denial order. An applicant may utilize the resubmission format for the same tobacco product for which FDA issued a marketing denial order or a new tobacco product that results from modifications to the product necessary to address the deficiencies described in a marketing denial order. An applicant may not submit a resubmission when:

(1) It incorporates new information or revisions to the PMTA for the original product to the extent that reviewing a resubmission for the new tobacco product would be confusing, cumbersome, or otherwise inefficient and submitting a standard PMTA under ยง 1114.7 would better facilitate review; or

(2) The marketing denial order states that the applicant may not submit a resubmission.
