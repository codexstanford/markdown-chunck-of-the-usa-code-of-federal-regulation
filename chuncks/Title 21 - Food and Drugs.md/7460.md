(iv)The calculation method used is that described in appendix X.1.3 (ASTM method D1243-79, cited and incorporated by reference in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) with the reduced viscosity determined for three concentration levels (0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 gram per deciliter) and extrapolated to zero concentration for intrinisic viscosity. The following formula is used for determining reduced viscosity:
