####### Steam controller.

(4)Each retort shall be equipped with an automatic steam controller to maintain the retort temperature. This may be a recorder-controller when combined with a temperature-recording device. A steam controller activated by the steam pressure of the retort is acceptable if it is carefully maintained mechanically so that it operates satisfactorily. Air-operated temperature controllers should have adequate filter systems to ensure a supply of clean, dry air.
