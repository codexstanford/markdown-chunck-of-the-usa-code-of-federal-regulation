####### e.g.,,e.g.,

(vi) Documentation demonstrating that appropriate, as determined by FDA, measures are in place (validated device design features) to ensure that safe therapy is maintained when communication with digitally connected devices is interrupted, lost, or re-established after an interruption. Validation testing results must demonstrate that critical events that occur during a loss of communications (commands, device malfunctions, occlusions, etc.) are handled and logged appropriately during and after the interruption to maintain patient safety.

(vii) A detailed plan and procedure for assigning postmarket responsibilities including adverse event reporting, complaint handling, and investigations with the manufacturers of devices that are digitally connected to the controller.

(2) Design verification and validation documentation must include appropriate design inputs and design outputs that are essential for the proper functioning of the device that have been documented and include the following:

(i) Risk control measures to address device system hazards;

(ii) Design decisions related to how the risk control measures impact essential performance; and

(iii) A traceability analysis demonstrating that all hazards are adequately controlled and that all controls have been validated in the final device design.

(3) The device shall include appropriate, as determined by FDA, and validated interface specifications for digitally connected devices. These interface specifications shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:

(i) Secure authentication (pairing) to connected devices;

(ii) Secure, accurate, and reliable means of data transmission between the controller and connected devices;
