####### Relationship between diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer risk.

(a)(1) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include: A family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.

(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer. Although the specific role of total dietary fiber, fiber components, and the multiple nutrients and other substances contained in these foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancer.
