(a)spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identifyspp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. Additionally, some of these reagents consist ofspp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identifyspp. directly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of listeriosis, a disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genusand provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms.the most common human pathogen of this genus, causes meningitis (inflammation of the brain membranes) and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and brain membranes) and is often fatal if untreated. A second form of human listeriosis is an intrauterine infection in pregnant women that results in a high mortality rate for infants before or after birth.
