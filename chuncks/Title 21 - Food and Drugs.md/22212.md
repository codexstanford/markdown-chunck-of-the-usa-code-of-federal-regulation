(a)A middle ear mold is a preformed device that is intended to be implanted to reconstruct the middle ear cavity during repair of the tympanic membrane. The device permits an ample air-filled cavity to be maintained in the middle ear and promotes regeneration of the mucous membrane lining of the middle ear cavity. A middle ear mold is made of materials such as polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone elastomer, or polyethylene, but does not contain porous polyethylene.
