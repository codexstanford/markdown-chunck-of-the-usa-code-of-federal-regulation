####### Varietal types.

(b)The optional fig ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are prepared from mature figs of the light or dark varieties. Figs (or whole figs), split figs (or broken figs), or any combination thereof are optional fig ingredients. A "whole fig" is one which is whole, but may be slightly cracked, provided it retains its natural conformation without exposing the interior. A "split" or "broken" fig is one that is open to such an extent that the seed cavity is exposed. The shape of the fruit may be distorted, and the fruit may or may not be broken apart into entirely separate pieces.
