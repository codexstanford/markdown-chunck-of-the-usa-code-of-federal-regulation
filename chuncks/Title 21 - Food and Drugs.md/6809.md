### Subchapter B - Food for Human Consumption
#### PART 174 - INDIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES: GENERAL
##### ยง 174.6 Threshold of regulation for substances used in food-contact articles.

Substances used in food-contact articles (e.g., food-packaging or food-processing equipment) that migrate, or that may be expected to migrate, into food at negligible levels may be reviewed under ยง 170.39 of this chapter. The Food and Drug Administration will exempt substances whose uses it determines meet the criteria in ยง 170.39 of this chapter from regulation as food additives and, therefore, a food additive petition will not be required for the exempted use.
