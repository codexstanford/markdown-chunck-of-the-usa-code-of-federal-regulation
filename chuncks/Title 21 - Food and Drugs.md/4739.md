###### ยง 123.6 Hazard analysis and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan.
####### The contents of the HACCP plan.

(c)The HACCP plan shall, at a minimum:

(1) List the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, as identified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and that thus must be controlled for each fish and fishery product. Consideration should be given to whether any food safety hazards are reasonably likely to occur as a result of the following:

(i) Natural toxins;

(ii) Microbiological contamination;

(iii) Chemical contamination;

(iv) Pesticides;

(v) Drug residues;

(vi) Decomposition in scombroid toxin-forming species or in any other species where a food safety hazard has been associated with decomposition;

(vii) Parasites, where the processor has knowledge or has reason to know that the parasite-containing fish or fishery product will be consumed without a process sufficient to kill the parasites, or where the processor represents, labels, or intends for the product to be so consumed;

(viii) Unapproved use of direct or indirect food or color additives; and

(ix) Physical hazards;

(2) List the critical control points for each of the identified food safety hazards, including as appropriate:

(i) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards that could be introduced in the processing plant environment; and

(ii) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards introduced outside the processing plant environment, including food safety hazards that occur before, during, and after harvest;

(3) List the critical limits that must be met at each of the critical control points;

(4) List the procedures, and frequency thereof, that will be used to monitor each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the critical limits;

(5) Include any corrective action plans that have been developed in accordance with ยง 123.7(b), to be followed in response to deviations from critical limits at critical control points;

(6) List the verification procedures, and frequency thereof, that the processor will use in accordance with ยง 123.8(a);

(7) Provide for a recordkeeping system that documents the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall contain the actual values and observations obtained during monitoring.
