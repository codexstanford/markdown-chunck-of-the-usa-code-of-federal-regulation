####### 4,4,i,4,ii

() Information shall be reported on the clinical positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for carrier status (and where possible, for each variant) in each population. Specifically, to calculate PPV and NPV, estimate test coverage (TC) and the percent of persons with variant(s) included in the device among all carriers: PPV = (PPA * TC * π)/(PPA * TC * π + (1 - NPA) * (1 - π)) and NPV = (NPA * (1 - π))/(NPA *(1 - π) + (1 - PPA*TC) * π) where PPA and NPA described either in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A)()() or in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A)()() of this section and π is prevalence of carriers in the population (pre-test risk to be a carrier for the disease).
