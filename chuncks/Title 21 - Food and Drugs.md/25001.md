###### Scan increment accuracy.

(i)The deviation of indicated scan increment from actual scan increment may not exceed 1 millimeter. Compliance shall be measured as follows: The determination of the deviation of indicated versus actual scan increment shall be based on measurements taken with a mass 100 kilograms or less, on the patient support device. The patient support device shall be incremented from a typical starting position to the maximum incrementation distance or 30 centimeters, whichever is less, and then returned to the starting position. Measurement of actual versus indicated scan increment may be taken anywhere along this travel.
