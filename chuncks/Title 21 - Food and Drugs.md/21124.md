####### 4,Interfering variant data:

()Nucleotide mutations that can interfere with the technology must be cited and evaluated. Data must be provided to demonstrate the effect of the interfering variant(s) on the performance of the correct calls. Alternatively, for each suspected interfering mutation for which data is not provided demonstrating the effect of the interfering variant, the manufacturer must identify the suspected interfering variants in the labeling and indicate that the impact that the interfering variants may have on the assay's performance has not been studied by providing a statement that reads "It is possible that the presence of [insert clearly identifying information for the suspected interfering variant] in a sample may interfere with the performance of this test. However, its effect on the performance of this test has not been studied."
