(1) Poly(oxy--phenylenesulfonyl--phenyleneoxy--phenyleneisopropylidene--phenylene) resins (CAS Reg. No. 25154-01-2) consisting of basic resins produced when the disodium salt of 4,4&#x2032;-isopropylidenediphenol is made to react with 4,4&#x2032;-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone in such a way that the finished resins have a minimum number average molecular weight of 15,000, as determined by osmotic pressure in monochlorobenzene; or

(2) 1,1&#x2032;-Sulfonylbis[4-chlorobenzene] polymer with 4,4&#x2032;-(1-methylethylidene)bis[phenol] (minimum 92 percent) and 4,4&#x2032;-sulfonylbis[phenol] (maximum 8 percent) (CAS Reg. No. 88285-91-0) produced when a mixture of 4,4&#x2032;-isopropylidenediphenol (minimum 92 percent) and 4,4&#x2032;-sulfonylbis[phenol] (maximum 8 percent) is made to react with 4,4&#x2032;-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone in such a way that the finished resin has a minimum number average molecular weight of 26,000, as determined by osmotic pressure in dimethylformamide.

(b) The basic polysulfone resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain optional adjuvant substances required in the production of such basic resins. The optional adjuvant substances required in the production of the basic polysulfone resins may include substances described in ยง 174.5(d) of this chapter and the following:
