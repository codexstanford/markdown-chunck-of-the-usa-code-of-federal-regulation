(ii) Subsequent determinations shall be at a minimum of 24-hour intervals for aqueous solvents, and 2-hour intervals for heptane. These tests shall yield total octylin stabilizers not to exceed 0.5 parts per million as determined by analytical method entitled "Atomic Absorption Spectrometric Determination of Sub-part-per-Million Quantities of Tin in Extracts and Biological Materials with Graphite Furnace,"Vol. 49, p. 1090-1093 (1977), which is incorporated by reference.
