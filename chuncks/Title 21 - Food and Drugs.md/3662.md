###### § 108.25 Acidified foods.

(a) Inadequate or improper manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to health. The harmful nature of such foods cannot be adequately determined after these foods have entered into interstate commerce. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs therefore finds that, to protect the public health, it may be necessary to require any commercial processor, in any establishment engaged in the manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods, to obtain and hold a temporary emergency permit provided for under section 404 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Such a permit may be required whenever the Commissioner finds, after investigation, that the commercial processor has failed to fulfill all the requirements of this section, including registration and filing of process information, and the mandatory portions of §§ 114.10, 114.80(a) (1) and (2), and (b), 114.83, 114.89, and 114.100 (b), (c), and (d) of this chapter as they relate to acidified foods. These requirements are intended to ensure safe manufacturing, processing, and packing processes and to permit the Food and Drug Administration to verify that these processes are being followed. Failure to meet these requirements shall constitute a prima facie basis for the immediate application of the emergency permit control provisions of section 404 of the act to that establishment, under the procedures established in subpart A of this part.

(b) The definitions in § 114.3 of this chapter are applicable when those terms are used in this section.
