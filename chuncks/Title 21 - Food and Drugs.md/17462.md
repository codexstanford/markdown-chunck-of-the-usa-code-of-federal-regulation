###### ยง 579.40 Ionizing radiation for the treatment of poultry feed and poultry feed ingredients.
####### Use.

(c)Ionizing radiation is used as a single treatment for rendering complete poultry diets or poultry feed ingredients salmonella negative as follows:

(1) Minimum dose 2.0 kiloGrays (kGy) (0.2 megarad (Mrad)); maximum dose 25 kGy (2.5 megarads Mrad). The absorbed dose of irradiation is to be based on initial concentration of salmonella using the relationship that 1.0 kGy (0.1 Mrad) reduces salmonella concentration by one log cycle (one decimal reduction).

(2) Feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated to account for nutritional loss.

(3) If an irradiated feed ingredient is less than 5 percent of the final product, the final product can be irradiated without being considered to be reirradiated.
