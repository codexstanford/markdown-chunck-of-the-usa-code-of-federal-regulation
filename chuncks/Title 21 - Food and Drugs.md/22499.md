(2)testing must be performed and must demonstrate that the device causes neither an adverse tissue response nor adverse performance.

(3) Non-clinical testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use. The following performance characteristics must be demonstrated:

(i) Mechanical testing to demonstrate that the device can withstand clinical forces;

(ii) Flow rate and leakage testing to demonstrate that the device does not impede the flow of enteral formula;

(iii) Demonstration of enzymatic effect on intended macronutrient;

(iv) The amount of enzyme that exits the cartridge must be characterized;

(v) Validation that the device does not adversely impact the nutritional composition of enteral formula; and

(vi) Validation that the device does not impede flow alarms on enteral feeding pumps.

(4) Human factors testing must be performed to characterize use error risks.

(5) Performance data must support shelf life by demonstrating package integrity and device functionality over the identified shelf life.

(6) Labeling must include the following:
