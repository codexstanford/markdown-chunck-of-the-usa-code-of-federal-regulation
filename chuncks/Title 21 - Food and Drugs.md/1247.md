###### ยง 14.80 Qualifications for members of standing policy and technical advisory committees.

(a) Members of a policy advisory committee-

(1) Shall have diverse interests, education, training, and experience; specific technical expertise is not a requirement;

(2) Are subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations either as special Government employees or as members of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (the Commissioner has determined that, because members representing particular interests, e.g., a representative of labor, industry, consumers, or agriculture, are included on advisory committees specifically for the purpose of representing these interests, any financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in the class which the member represents is irrelevant to the services which the Government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integrity of their services); and

(3) Shall be voting members.
