####### Classification.

(b)Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) The intended use of the device must specify the target HLA allele(s) or antigen(s), the patient population(s), and the corresponding therapeutic product(s).

(2) Design verification and validation must include:

(i) Detailed documentation of an analytical accuracy study that uses well-characterized samples including clinical samples from intended use population(s) focusing on the target allele(s) needed for patient selection;

(ii) Detailed documentation of precision studies (repeatability, reproducibility) that evaluate possible sources of variation that may affect test results;

(iii) Detailed documentation of a study determining range of input sample concentrations that meet performance specifications;

(iv) Detailed description of the ambiguity resolution method, if applicable;

(v) For a sequencing-based assay, documentation of coverage and predefined coverage threshold of target genomic regions, pertinent variant types, and sequence contexts;

(vi) For multiplex assays, documentation of a risk assessment and design specifications that are in place to prevent incorrect reactivity assignment;

(vii) Description of a plan on how to ensure the performance of the device does not change when new HLA alleles are identified, and/or when reactivity assignments are changed; and
