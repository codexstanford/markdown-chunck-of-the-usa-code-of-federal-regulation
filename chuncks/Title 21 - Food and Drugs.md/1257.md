(ii) The performance of an IND or NDA review or similar review.

(2) A committee member who undertakes a special assignment, the end product of which does not represent the end product of the advisory committee, but rather of the committee member's own assignment, can be compensated. Should this preparatory work by members collectively result in an end product of the committee, this is to be considered normal meeting preparation and committee members are not to be compensated for this work.

(d) Salary while in travel status is authorized when a committee member's ordinary pursuits are interrupted for the substantial portion of an additional day beyond the day or days spent in performing those services, and as a consequence the committee member loses some regular compensation. This applies on weekends and holidays if the special Government employee loses income that would otherwise be earned on that day. For travel purposes, a substantial portion of a day is defined as 50 percent of the working day, and the traveler will be paid at a daily rate.
