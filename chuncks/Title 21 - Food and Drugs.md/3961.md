###### ยง 112.84 Does this regulation require covered farms to take actions that would constitute a "taking" of threatened or endangered species; to take measures to exclude animals from outdoor growing areas; or to destroy animal habitat or otherwise clear farm borders around outdoor growing areas or drainages?
####### i.e.,

No. Nothing in this regulation authorizes the "taking" of threatened or endangered species as that term is defined by the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544) (to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct), in violation of the Endangered Species Act. This regulation does not require covered farms to take measures to exclude animals from outdoor growing areas, or to destroy animal habitat or otherwise clear farm borders around outdoor growing areas or drainages.
