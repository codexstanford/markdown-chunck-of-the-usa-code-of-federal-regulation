####### Mooney viscosity-olefin copolymers described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.

(6)Mooney viscosity is determined by ASTM method D1646-81, "Standard Test Method for Rubber-Viscosity and Vulcanization Characteristics (Mooney Viscometer)," which is incorporated by reference (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), using the large rotor at a temperature of 100 &#xB0;C, except that a temperature of 127 &#xB0;C shall be used for those copolymers whose Mooney viscosity cannot be determined at 100 &#xB0;C. The apparatus containing the sample is warmed for 1 minute, run for 8 minutes, and viscosity measurements are then made.
