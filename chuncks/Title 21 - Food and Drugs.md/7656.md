(a) Limitations for acrylonitrile monomer extraction for finished food-contact articles, determined by a method of analysis titled "Gas-Solid Chromatographic Procedure for Determining Acrylonitrile Monomer in Acrylonitrile-Containing Polymers and Food Simulating Solvents," which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-200), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

(1) In the case of single-use articles having a volume to surface ratio of 10 milliliters or more per square inch of food contact surface-0.003 milligram/square inch when extracted to equilibrium at 120 &#xB0;F with food-simulating solvents appropriate to the intended conditions of use.

(2) In the case of single-use articles having a volume to surface ratio of less than 10 milliliters per square inch of food contact surface-0.3 part per million calculated on the basis of the volume of the container when extracted to equilibrium at 120 &#xB0;F with food-simulating solvents appropriate to the intended conditions of use.

(3) In the case of repeated-use articles-0.003 milligram/square inch when extracted at a time equivalent to initial batch usage utilizing food-simulating solvents and temperatures appropriate to the intended conditions of use.
