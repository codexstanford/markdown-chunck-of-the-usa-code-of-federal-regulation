###### ยง 1107.18 Required content and format of an SE Report.
####### Overview.

(a)The SE Report must provide information uniquely identifying the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product, and compare the new tobacco product to either a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or a tobacco product that FDA previously found to be substantially equivalent. The SE Report must provide sufficient information as described in this section to enable FDA to determine whether the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007. If FDA cites deficiencies and requests information to support a statement in the SE Report, the applicant must provide that information for review to continue, or FDA may issue an order under ยง 1107.48. FDA generally intends to refuse to accept an SE Report for review if it does not comply with ยง 1105.10 and this section. The SE Report must contain the following information:
