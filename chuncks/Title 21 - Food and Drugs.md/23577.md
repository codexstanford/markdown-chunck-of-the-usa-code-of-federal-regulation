####### Identification.

(a)A haploscope is an AC-powered device that consists of two movable viewing tubes, each containing a slide carrier, a low-intensity light source for the illumination of the slides, and a high-intensity light source for creating afterimages. The device is intended to measure strabismus (eye muscle imbalance), to assess binocular vision (use of both eyes to see), and to treat suppression and amblyopia (dimness of vision without any apparent disease of the eye).
