##### ยง 361.1 Radioactive drugs for certain research uses.
###### Radiation dose to subjects.

(1)To assure that the radiation dose to research subjects is as low as practicable to perform the study and meet the criteria of ยง 361.1(b)(3), the Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall require that:

(i) The investigator provide absorbed dose calculations based on biologic distribution data available from published literature or from other valid studies.

(ii) The investigator provide for an acceptable method of radioassay of the radioactive drug prior to its use to assure that the dose calculations actually reflect the administered dose.

(iii) The radioactive drug chosen for the study has that combination of half-life, types of radiations, radiation energy, metabolism, chemical properties, etc., which results in the lowest dose to the whole body or specific organs with which it is possible to obtain the necessary information.

(iv) The investigator utilize adequate and appropriate instrumentation for the detection and measurement of the specific radionuclide.
