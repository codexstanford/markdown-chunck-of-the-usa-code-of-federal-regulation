####### In vivo

(7)testing must demonstrate that the device thermally ablates targeted tissue in a controlled manner without thermal injury to adjacent, non-target tissues.

(8) Clinical testing must document the adverse event profile, provide evidence of prostatic ablation, and demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use.

(9) Training must be provided so that upon completion of the training program, the physician can:

(i) Use all safety features of the device;

(ii) Accurately target the high intensity ultrasound energy within the desired region of the prostate; and

(iii) Perform the ablation procedure in a manner that minimizes damage to non-target tissues.

(10) Labeling must include:

(i) A section that summarizes the clinical testing results, including the adverse event profile and evidence of prostate ablation achieved; and

(ii) An expiration date or shelf life for single use components.
