The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media.

(2) Serving sizes should be determined, and nutrients declared, in accordance with ยง 101.9 (b) and (c), respectively, except that the nutrition labeling data should be based on the raw edible portion for fruits and vegetables and on the cooked edible portion for fish. The methods used to cook fish should be those that do not add fat, breading, or seasoning (e.g., salt or spices).
