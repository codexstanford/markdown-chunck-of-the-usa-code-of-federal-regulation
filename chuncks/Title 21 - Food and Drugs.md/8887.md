###### ยง 207.1 What definitions and interpretations of terms apply to this part?
####### Manufacturer

means a person who owns or operates an establishment that manufactures a drug or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug. This term includes, but is not limited to, control laboratories, contract laboratories, contract manufacturers, contract packers, contract labelers, and other entities that manufacture a drug, or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, as defined in this paragraph. For purposes of this part, and in order to clarify the responsibilities of the entities engaged in different operations, the term manufacturer is defined and used separately from the terms relabeler, repacker, and salvager, although the term "manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing," as used in section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, includes the activities of relabelers, repackers, and salvagers. Repackers, relabelers, and salvagers are subject to the provisions of this part that are applicable to repackers, relabelers, and salvagers, but are not subject to the provisions of this part that are applicable to manufacturers. When not modified by "domestic" or "foreign," the term includes both domestic manufacturers and foreign manufacturers.
