###### ยง 207.1 What definitions and interpretations of terms apply to this part?
####### Manufacture

means each step in the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug. Manufacture includes the making by chemical, physical, biological, or other procedures or manipulations of a drug, or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, including control procedures applied to the final product or to any part of the process. Manufacture includes manipulation, sampling, testing, or control procedures applied to the final product or to any part of the process, including, for example, analytical testing of drugs for another registered establishment's drug. For purposes of this part, and in order to clarify the responsibilities of the entities engaged in different operations, the term manufacture is defined and used separately from the terms relabel, repackage, and salvage, although the term "manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing," as used in section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, includes relabeling, repackaging, and salvaging activities.
