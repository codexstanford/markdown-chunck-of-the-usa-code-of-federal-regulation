(2) The weight average molecular weight of the basic polymer is not less than 100,000 when determined by gel permeation chromatography using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. The gel permeation chromatography is calibrated with polystyrene standards. The basic gel permeation chromatographic method is described in ANSI/ASTM D3536-76, which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(3) The basic polymer or food-contact article described in paragraph (a) of this section, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of ยง 176.170(c) of this chapter, yields net chloroform-soluble extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed .08 milligram per square centimeter (0.5 milligram per square inch) of food-contact surface when tested by the methods described in ยง 176.170(d). If the finished food-contact article is itself the subject of a regulation in parts 174 through 178 and ยง 179.45 of this chapter, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed for it by the regulation.
