######## Conduct of regulatory hearing.

(f)(1) If the presiding officer grants a request for a regulatory hearing, the hearing will be held within 10 business days after the date the request was filed or, if applicable, within a timeframe agreed upon in writing by the accreditation body or laboratory, and the presiding officer and FDA.

(2) The presiding officer must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that, pursuant to § 16.5(b) of this chapter, the procedures for a regulatory hearing apply only to the extent that such procedures are supplementary and do not conflict with the procedures specified for regulatory hearings under this subpart.

(3) A decision by the presiding officer to affirm the revocation of recognition or laboratory disqualification is considered a final agency action under 5 U.S.C. 702.
