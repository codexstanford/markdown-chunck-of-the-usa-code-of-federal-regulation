(3)Paper or paperboard ready for use in packaging shall be tested by use of the extraction cell described in "Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists," 13th Ed. (1980), sections 21.010-21.015, under "Exposing Flexible Barrier Materials for Extraction," which is incorporated by reference (Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Formed paper and paperboard products such as containers and lids, that cannot be tested satisfactorily by any of the above methods may be tested in specially designed extraction equipment, usually consisting of clamping devices that fit the closure or container so that the food-contact surface can be tested, or, if flat samples can be cut from the formed paper or paperboard products without destroying the integrity of the food-contact surface, they may be tested by adapting the following "sandwich" method:
