####### Identification.

(a)An implanted mechanical/hydraulic urinary continence device is a device used to treat urinary incontinence by the application of continuous or intermittent pressure to occlude the urethra. The totally implanted device may consist of a static pressure pad, or a system with a container of radiopaque fluid in the abdomen and a manual pump and valve under the skin surface that is connected by tubing to an adjustable pressure pad or to a cuff around the urethra. The fluid is pumped as needed from the container to inflate the pad or cuff to pass on the urethra.
