(1) Phase contrast microscopes, which permit visualization of unstained preparations by altering the phase relationship of light that passes around the object and through the object.

(2) Fluorescense microscopes, which permit examination of specimens stained with fluorochromes that fluoresce under ultraviolet light.

(3) Inverted stage microscopes, which permit examination of tissue cultures or other biological specimens contained in bottles or tubes with the light source mounted above the specimen.
