####### Collection of blood samples.

(c)(1) When comparison of the test product and the reference material is to be based on blood concentration time curves, unless some other approach is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, blood samples should be taken with sufficient frequency to permit an estimate of both:

(i) The peak concentration in the blood of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its metabolite(s), measured; and

(ii) The total area under the curve for a time period at least three times the half-life of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its metabolite(s), measured.

(2) In a study comparing oral dosage forms, the sampling times should be identical.

(3) In a study comparing an intravenous dosage form and an oral dosage form, the sampling times should be those needed to describe both:

(i) The distribution and elimination phase of the intravenous dosage form; and

(ii) The absorption and elimination phase of the oral dosage form.

(4) In a study comparing drug delivery systems other than oral or intravenous dosage forms with an appropriate reference standard, the sampling times should be based on valid scientific reasons.
