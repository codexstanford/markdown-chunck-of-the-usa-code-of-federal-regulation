(B)Administer a starting dose of 0.2 to 0.5 IU/pound of body weight (0.5 to 1.0 IU/kg) once daily. When transitioning from another insulin product, this form of insulin should be started once daily, regardless of the frequency of prior insulin use. The dose should be given concurrently with or right after a meal. Reevaluate the dog at appropriate intervals and adjust the dose based on both clinical signs and laboratory test results until adequate glycemic control has been attained. Twice-daily therapy should be initiated if the duration of insulin action is determined to be inadequate. If twice-daily treatment is initiated, the two doses should be 25 percent less than the once daily dose required to attain an acceptable nadir.
