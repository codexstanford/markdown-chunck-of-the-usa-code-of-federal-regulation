###### ยง 146.150 Canned concentrated orange juice.

(a) Canned concentrated orange juice is the food that complies with the requirements of composition, definition of dilution ratio, and labeling of ingredients prescribed for frozen concentrated orange juice by ยง 146.146, except that it is not frozen and it is sealed in containers and so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, so as to prevent spoilage.

(b) The name of the food when concentrated to a dilution ratio of 3 plus 1 is "Canned concentrated orange juice" or "Canned orange juice concentrate". The name of the food when concentrated to a dilution ratio greater than 3 plus 1 is "Canned concentrated orange juice, ______ plus 1" or "Canned orange juice concentrate, ______ plus 1", the blank being filled in with the whole number showing the dilution ratio; for example, "Canned orange juice concentrate, 4 plus 1". However, where the label bears directions for making 1 quart of single-strength diluted product (or multiples of a quart) the blank in the name may be filled in with a mixed number; for example, "Canned orange juice concentrate, 4plus 1". For containers larger than 1 pint, the dilution ratio in the name may be replaced by the concentration of orange juice soluble solids in degrees Brix; for example, a 62&#xB0; Brix concentrate in 1-gallon cans may be named on the label "canned concentrated orange juice, 62&#xB0; Brix". If the food does not purport to be frozen concentrated orange juice, the word "canned" may be omitted from the name.
