####### Grounds for rescinding a substantially equivalent order.

(a)FDA may rescind a substantially equivalent order allowing a new tobacco product to be marketed if FDA determines that:

(1) The tobacco product for which the order has been issued:

(i) Does not have the same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product; or

(ii) Has different characteristics and there is insufficient information demonstrating that it is not appropriate to require a premarket tobacco product application under section 910(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the product does not raise different questions of public health; or

(2) The SE Report (including any submitted amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or

(3) Concerning an SE Report that compared the new tobacco product to a tobacco product that FDA previously found substantially equivalent,

(i) The predicate tobacco product relied on in the SE Report has been found ineligible because its SE Report (including any amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or

(ii) A predicate tobacco product on which any of the previous substantial equivalence determinations was based, going back to the original predicate tobacco product, has been found ineligible because its SE Report (including any amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or

(4) FDA or the applicant has removed from the market, due to a health or safety concern related to the tobacco product:

(i) The predicate tobacco product on which the substantial equivalence determination is based; or

(ii) A predicate tobacco product on which any of the previous substantial equivalence determinations is based, going back to the original predicate tobacco product, if the substantial equivalence SE Report compared the new tobacco product to a tobacco product that FDA previously found substantially equivalent.
