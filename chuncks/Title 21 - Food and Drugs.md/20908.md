####### e.g.,

(B) Device clinical performance established by comparing device results at multiple U.S. sites to the clinical diagnostic standard used in the United States, using patient samples from the assay-specific intended use population and the differential diagnosis population. For all samples, the diagnostic clinical criteria and the demographic information must be collected and provided. Clinical validation must be based on the determination of clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity using the test results (antibody status based on fluorescence to include pattern and titer, if applicable) compared to the clinical diagnosis of the subject from whom the clinical sample was obtained. The data must be summarized in tabular format comparing the result generated by automated, manual, and digital only interpretation to the disease status;

(C) Device precision/reproducibility data generated from within-run, between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-operator, between-instruments, between-site, and total precision for multiple nonconsecutive days (as applicable) using multiple operators, multiple instruments and at multiple sites. A well-characterized panel of patient samples or pools from the associated assay specific intended use population must be used;

(D) Device linearity data generated from patient samples covering the assay measuring range, if applicable;

(E) Device analytical sensitivity data, including limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation, if applicable;

(F) Device assay specific cutoff, if applicable;

(G) Device analytical specificity data, including interference by endogenous and exogenous substances, if applicable;

(H) Device instrument carryover data, if applicable;

(I) Device stability data including real-time stability under various storage times and temperatures, if applicable; and

(J) Information on traceability to a reference material and description of value assignment of calibrators and controls, if applicable.

(iii) Identification of risk mitigation elements used by the device, including description of all additional procedures, methods, and practices, incorporated into the directions for use that mitigate risks associated with testing.

(3) Your 21 CFR 809.10 compliant labeling must include:

(i) A warning statement that reads "The device is for use by a trained operator in a clinical laboratory setting";

(ii) A warning statement that reads "All software-aided results must be confirmed by the trained operator";

(iii) A warning statement that reads "This device is only for use with reagents that are indicated for use with the device"; and

(iv) A description of the protocol and performance studies performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and a summary of the results, if applicable.
