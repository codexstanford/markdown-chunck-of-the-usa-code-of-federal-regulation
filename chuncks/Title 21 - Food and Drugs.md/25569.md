(2) For cigars, FDA will:

(i) Multiply the units of small cigars removed and not tax exempt for the most recent full calendar year by the 2003 maximum Federal excise tax rate for small cigars (small cigar subclass dollar figure).

(ii) Multiply the units of large cigars removed and not tax exempt for the most recent full calendar year by the 2003 maximum Federal excise tax rate for large cigars (large cigar subclass dollar figure).

(iii) Add the small cigar subclass dollar figure and the large cigar subclass dollar figure (cigar class dollar figure).

(3) FDA will total the class dollar figures for all tobacco classes for the most recent full calendar year (total dollar figure).

(4) FDA will divide the class dollar figure by the total dollar figure to determine the percentage share for each class.

(5) FDA will calculate the allocation for each class of tobacco products by multiplying the percentage share for each class by the total assessment.
