###### ยง 201.304 Tannic acid and barium enema preparations.

(a) It has become a widespread practice for tannic acid to be added to barium enemas to improve X-ray pictures. Tannic acid is capable of causing diminished liver function and severe liver necrosis when absorbed in sufficient amounts. The medical literature reports a number of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to barium enemas. There is a lack of scientific evidence to establish the conditions, if any, under which tannic acid is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
