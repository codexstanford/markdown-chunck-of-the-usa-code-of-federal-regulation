###### Measurement parameters.

(3)Accessible emission levels of laser and collateral radiation shall be based upon the following measurements as appropriate, or their equivalent:

(i) For laser products intended to be used in a locale where the emitted laser radiation is unlikely to be viewed with optical instruments, the radiant power (W) or radiant energy (J) detectable through a circular aperture stop having a diameter of 7 millimeters and within a circular solid angle of acceptance of 1 x 10steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less. For scanned laser radiation, the direction of the solid angle of acceptance shall change as needed to maximize detectable radiation, with an angular speed of up to 5 radians/second. A 50 millimeter diameter aperture stop with the same collimating optics and acceptance angle stated above shall be used for all other laser products (except that a 7 millimeter diameter aperture stop shall be used in the measurement of scanned laser radiation emitted by laser products manufactured on or before August 20, 1986.

(ii) The irradiance (W cm) or radiant exposure (J cmequivalent to the radiant power (W) or radiant energy (J) detectable through a circular aperture stop having a diameter of 7 millimeters and, for irradiance, within a circular solid angle of acceptance of 1 x x 10steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less, divided by the area of the aperture stop (cm).

(iii) The radiance (W cmsr) or integrated radiance (J cmsr) equivalent to the radiant power (W) or radiant energy (J) detectable through a circular aperture stop having a diameter of 7 millimeters and within a circular solid angle of acceptance of 1 x 10steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less, divided by that solid angle (sr) and by the area of the aperture stop (cm).
