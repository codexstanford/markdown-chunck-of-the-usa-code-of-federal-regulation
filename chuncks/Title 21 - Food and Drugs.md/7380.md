(iii)A weighed sample is extracted with water at 150 &#xB0;F for 2 hours, filtered, and the volume of filtrate is measured (milliliters) as in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Two drops of 50 percent by weight sodium hydroxide solution are added and the solution is evaporated to approximately 150 milliliters. The solution is quantitatively transferred to a 250-milliliter beaker, methyl purple indicator is added, and the solution is neutralized with 0.1nitric acid. For each 100 milliliters of solution is added 1.5 milliliters of 2nitric acid. The solution is titrated with 0.005silver nitrate to the equivalence potential end point, using the expanded scale pH meter described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. A complete blank must be run in duplicate. Calculation:
