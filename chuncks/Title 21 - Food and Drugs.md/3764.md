####### Preventing microbial contamination.

(a)You must take measures to exclude from any operations any person who might be a source of microbial contamination, due to a health condition, where such contamination may occur, of any material, including components, dietary supplements, and contact surfaces used in the manufacture, packaging, labeling, or holding of a dietary supplement. Such measures include the following:

(1) Excluding from working in any operations that may result in contamination any person who, by medical examination, the person's acknowledgement, or supervisory observation, is shown to have, or appears to have, an illness, infection, open lesion, or any other abnormal source of microbial contamination, that could result in microbial contamination of components, dietary supplements, or contact surfaces, until the health condition no longer exists; and

(2) Instructing your employees to notify their supervisor(s) if they have or if there is a reasonable possibility that they have a health condition described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that could result in microbial contamination of any components, dietary supplements, or any contact surface.
