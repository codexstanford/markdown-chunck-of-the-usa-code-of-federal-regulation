###### Manufacturers' responsibility.

(c)Manufacturers of products subject to §§ 1020.30 through 1020.33 shall certify that each of their products meets all applicable requirements when installed into a diagnostic x-ray system according to instructions. This certification shall be made under the format specified in § 1010.2 of this chapter. Manufacturers may certify a combination of two or more components if they obtain prior authorization in writing from the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
