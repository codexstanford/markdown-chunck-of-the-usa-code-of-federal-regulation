####### Can the labeling provisions of paragraph (h) of this section be waived, and how can I apply for a waiver?

(i)(1) The labeling provisions of paragraph (h) of this section may be waived if there is evidence to indicate that it is unlikely a new animal drug would be used in the manufacture of a liquid medicated feed.

(2) To obtain a waiver, you must submit a letter requesting a waiver to the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (HFV-100), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.

(3) The letter must include a copy of the product label; a description of the formulation; and information to establish that the physical, chemical, or other properties of the new animal drug are such that diversion to use in liquid medicated feed is unlikely.
