###### ยง 177.2400 Perfluorocarbon cured elastomers.
####### Identity.

(a)(1) For the purpose of this section, perfluorocarbon cured elastomers are produced by terpolymerizing tetrafluorethylene (CAS Reg. No. 116-14-3), perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 1187-93-5), and perfluoro-2-phenoxypropyl vinyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 24520-19-2) and subsequent curing of the terpolymer (CAS Reg. No. 26658-70-8) using the crosslinking agent, phenol, 4,4&#x2032;-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl) ethylidene] bis-,dipotassium salt (CAS Reg. No. 25088-69-1) and accelerator, 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (CAS Reg. No. 17455-13-9).

(2) The perfluorocarbon base polymer shall contain no less than 40 weight-percent of polymer units derived from tetrafluoroethylene, no less than 40 weight-percent of polymer units derived from perfluoromethyl vinyl ether and no more than 5 weight-percent polymer units derived from perfluoro-2-phenoxy-propyl vinyl ether.

(3) The composition limitations of the cured elastomer, calculated as parts per 100 parts of terpolymer, are as follows:
