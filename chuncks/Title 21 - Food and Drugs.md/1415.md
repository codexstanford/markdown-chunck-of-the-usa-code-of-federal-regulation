####### Other requests.

(3)If the request is not the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent of other media). The Agency shall not assess search or duplication fees if the Agency fails to comply with any time limit, as described in ยง 20.41, if no unusual or exceptional circumstances apply to the processing of the request. If unusual circumstances, as outlined in ยง 20.41, apply and more than 5,000 pages are responsive to the request, the Food and Drug Administration may charge search or duplication fees if timely written notice has been made to the requester and the Agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
