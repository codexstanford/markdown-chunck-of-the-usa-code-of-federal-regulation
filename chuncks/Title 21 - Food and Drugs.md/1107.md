####### Can FDA use means other than a guidance document to communicate new agency policy or a new regulatory approach to a broad public audience?

(e)The agency may not use documents or other means of communication that are excluded from the definition of guidance document to informally communicate new or different regulatory expectations to a broad public audience for the first time. These GGP's must be followed whenever regulatory expectations that are not readily apparent from the statute or regulations are first communicated to a broad public audience.
