###### ยง 137.350 Enriched rice.

(a) The foods for which definitions and standards of identity are prescribed by this section are forms of milled rice (except rice coated with talc and glucose and known as coated rice), to which nutrients have been added so that each pound of the rice contains:

(1) Not less than 2.0 milligrams (mg) and not more than 4.0 mg of thiamin, not less than 1.2 mg and not more than 2.4 mg of riboflavin, not less than 16 mg and not more than 32 mg of niacin or niacinamide, not less than 0.7 mg and not more than 1.4 mg of folic acid, and not less than 13 mg and not more than 26 mg of iron (Fe).

(2) Each pound may contain not less than 250 U.S.P. units and not more than 1,000 U.S.P. units of vitamin D.

(3) Each pound may contain not less than 500 milligrams and not more than 1,000 milligrams of calcium (Ca). Calcium carbonate derived from the use of this substance in milling rice, when present in quantities that furnish less than 500 milligrams of calcium (Ca) per pound, is considered a normal ingredient of the milled rice used and not an optional ingredient of the enriched rice unless such enriched rice is labeled to show it contains the optional ingredient calcium. Iron and calcium may be added only in forms that are harmless and assimilable. The vitamins referred to in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section may be combined with harmless substances to render them insoluble in water, if the water-insoluble products are assimilable.

(4) In the case of enriched parboiled rice, butylated hydroxytoluene may be added as an optional ingredient in an amount not to exceed 0.0033 percent by weight of the finished food.

(b) The substances referred to in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section may be added in a harmless carrier. Such carrier is used only in the quantity necessary to effect an intimate and uniform mixture of such substances with the rice.

(c) Unless the label of the food bears the statement "To retain vitamins do not rinse before or drain after cooking" immediately preceding or following the name of the food and in letters not less than one-fourth the point size of type used for printing the name of the food (but in no case less than 8-point type) and the label bears no cooking directions calling for washing or draining or unless the food is precooked and it is packaged in consumer packages which are conspicuously and prominently labeled with directions for preparation which, if followed, will avoid washing away or draining off enriching ingredients, the substances named in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section shall be present in such quantity or in such form that when the enriched rice is washed as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, the washed rice contains not less than 85 percent of the minimum quantities of the substances named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as required for enriched rice; and in case any optional ingredients named in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section are used, the washed rice also contains not less than 85 percent of the minimum quantity specified for the substance or substances used.

(d) The name specified for each food for which a definition and standard of identity is prescribed by this section is the common name of the kind of milled rice to which the enriching substances are added, preceded by the word "enriched" as, for example, "Enriched rice" or "Enriched parboiled rice".
