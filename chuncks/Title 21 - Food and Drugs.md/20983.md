####### Indentification.

(a)A hemoglobin immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the different types of free hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells) in blood, urine, plasma, or other body fluids. Measurements of free hemoglobin aid in the diagnosis of various hematologic disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, Fanconi's anemia (a rare inherited disease), aplastic anemia (bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells), and leukemia (cancer of the blood-forming organs).
