######## Identification.

(a)A complement Cinhibitor (inactivator) immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the complement Cinhibitor (a plasma protein) in serum. Complement Cinhibitor occurs normally in plasma and blocks the action of the Ccomponent of complement (a group of serum proteins which destroy infectious agents). Measurement of complement Cinhibitor aids in the diagnosis of hereditary angioneurotic edema (increased blood vessel permeability causing swelling of tissues) and a rare form of angioedema associated with lymphoma (lymph node cancer).
