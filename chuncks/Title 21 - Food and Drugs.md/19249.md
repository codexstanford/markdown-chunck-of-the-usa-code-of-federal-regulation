###### § 810.15 Communications concerning a cease distribution and notification or mandatory recall order.
####### General.

(a)The person named in a cease distribution and notification order issued under § 810.10 or a mandatory recall order issued under § 810.13 is responsible for promptly notifying each health professional, device user facility, consignee, or individual, as appropriate, of the order. In accordance with § 810.10(c) or § 810.13(b)(4), FDA may provide the person named in the cease distribution and notification or mandatory recall order with a model letter for notifying each health professional, device user facility, consignee, or individual, as appropriate, of the order. However, if FDA does not provide the person named in the cease distribution and notification or mandatory recall order with a model letter, the person named in a cease distribution and notification order issued under § 810.10, or a mandatory recall order issued under § 810.13, is responsible for providing such notification. The purpose of the communication is to convey:

(1) That FDA has found that there is a reasonable probability that use of the device would cause a serious, adverse health consequence or death;

(2) That the person named in the order has ceased distribution of the device;

(3) That health professionals and device user facilities should cease use of the device immediately;

(4) Where appropriate, that the device is subject to a mandatory recall order; and

(5) Specific instructions on what should be done with the device.
