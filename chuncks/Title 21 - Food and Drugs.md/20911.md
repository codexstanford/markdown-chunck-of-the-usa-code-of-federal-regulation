####### Identification.

(a)Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment for clinical use is a device used to perform a specific test on proteins by using a procedure called rocket immunoelectrophoresis. In this procedure, an electric current causes the protein in solution to migrate through agar gel containing specific antisera. The protein precipitates with the antisera in a rocket-shaped pattern, giving the name to the device. The height of the peak (or the area under the peak) is proportional to the concentration of the protein.
