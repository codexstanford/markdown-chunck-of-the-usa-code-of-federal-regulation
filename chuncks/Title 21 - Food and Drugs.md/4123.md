####### Water circulation.

(11)When a water circulating system is used for heat distribution, it shall be installed in such a manner that water will be drawn from the bottom of the retort through a suction manifold and discharged through a spreader which extends the length of the top of the retort. The holes in the water spreader shall be uniformly distributed and should have an aggregate area not greater than the cross-sectional area of the outlet line from the pump. The suction outlets shall be protected with nonclogging screens or other suitable means shall be used to keep debris from entering the circulating system. The pump shall be designed to provide proper flow on startup and during operation, such as with a bleeder or other suitable means to remove air during startup and with an appropriate device or design to prevent pump cavitation during operation. The pump shall be equipped with a signaling device to warn the operator when it is not running. Alternative methods for circulation of water in the retort may be used when established by a competent authority as adequate for even heat distribution.
