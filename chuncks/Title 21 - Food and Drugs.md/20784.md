(a)Aspecies antigen detection assay is a device that employs antibodies for the detection of specific malaria parasite antigens, including histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) specific antigens, and pan malarial antigens in human whole blood. These devices are used for testing specimens from individuals who have signs and symptoms consistent with malaria infection. The detection of these antigens aids in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of malaria caused by the four malaria species capable of infecting humans:,,, and, and aids in the differential diagnosis ofinfections from other less virulentspecies. The device is intended for use in conjunction with other clinical laboratory findings.
