###### Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1.

(i)The Commissioner has learned of the contamination of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been submitted to permit establishment of appropriate specifications for the batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
