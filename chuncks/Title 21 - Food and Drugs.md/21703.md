####### Identification.

(a)A pacing system analyzer (PSA) is a prescription device that combines the functionality of a pacemaker electrode function tester (ยง 870.3720) and an external pacemaker pulse generator (EPPG) (ยง 870.3600). It is connected to a pacemaker lead and uses a power supply and electronic circuits to supply an accurately calibrated, variable pacing pulse for measuring the patient's pacing threshold and intracardiac R-wave potential. A PSA may be a single, dual, or triple chamber system and can simultaneously deliver pacing therapy while testing one or more implanted pacing leads.
