###### Displays of values of AKR and cumulative air kerma.

(6)For fluoroscopic x-ray systems manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, the following shall be provided:

(i) A schedule of maintenance for any system instrumentation associated with the display of air kerma information necessary to maintain the displays of AKR and cumulative air kerma within the limits of allowed uncertainty specified by ยง 1020.32(k)(6) and, if the capability for user calibration of the display is provided, adequate instructions for such calibration;

(ii) Identification of the distances along the beam axis:

(A) From the focal spot to the isocenter, and

(B) From the focal spot to the reference location to which displayed values of AKR and cumulative air kerma refer according to ยง 1020.32(k)(4);

(iii) A rationale for specification of a reference irradiation location alternative to 15 cm from the isocenter toward the x-ray source along the beam axis when such alternative specification is made according to ยง 1020.32(k)(4)(ii).

(i) [Reserved]
