(5)-(i)Evaporate the food-simulating solvents from paragraph (e)(4)(i) to (xvii), inclusive, of this section to about 100 milliliters in the Pyrex flask and transfer to a clean, tared platinum dish, washing the flask three times with the solvent used in the extraction procedure, and evaporate to a few milliliters on a nonsparking low-temperature hotplate. The last few milliliters should be evaporated in an oven maintained at a temperature of 212 &#xB0;F. Cool the platinum dish in a desiccator for 30 minutes and weigh the residue to the nearest 0.1 milligram (). Calculate the extractives in milligrams per square inch and in parts per million for the particular size of container being tested and for the specific food-simulating solvent used.
