()Assemble the extraction vessel, condenser, and magnetic stir bar. Add-hexane (1 liter) to the extraction vessel and clamp the assembly into a water bath set at 49.5 &#xB0;C +/-0.5 &#xB0;C. Start the water flowing through the jacket of the reflux condenser. Adjust the air flow through the stirring motor to give a smooth and uniform stir rate. Allow the-hexane to preheat for 1 hour to bring the temperature to 49.5 &#xB0;C+/-0.5 &#xB0;C. Temperature is a critical factor in this analysis and it must not vary more than 1 &#xB0;C. If the temperature exceeds these limits, the test must be discontinued and restarted. Blown, compression molded, or extrusion cast films can be tested. Ideally, the film should be prepared by the same process as will be used with the production resin. Using gloves and metal tweezers to avoid sample contamination, cut about 2.7 grams of the prepared film (4 mils or less in thickness) into about 1-inch squares using clean sharp scissors. Proceed with Option 1 or 2.
