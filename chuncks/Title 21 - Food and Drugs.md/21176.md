() For mutations that are designated as cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance and that are based on evidence established in the intended specimen type (tumor tissues) but for a different analyte type (protein, RNA) and/or a measurement (incorporating a score or copy number) and/or with an alternative technology (IHC, RT-qPCR, FISH), evidence of accuracy must include clinically adequate concordance between results for the mutation and the medically established biomarker test (evidence generated from an appropriately sized method comparison study using clinical specimens from the target population).
