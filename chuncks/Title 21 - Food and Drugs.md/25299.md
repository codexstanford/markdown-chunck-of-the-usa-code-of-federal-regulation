####### Shelf life and stability information.

(f)With the exception of SE Reports for roll-your-own tobacco products and cigarettes that are not HTPs, SE Reports for all tobacco products must contain information on the stability of the new and predicate tobacco products over the shelf life, including the following information:

(1) The length of the shelf life, a description of how shelf life is determined, and a description of how shelf life is indicated on the tobacco product, if applicable. If a tobacco product does not have a defined shelf life, state as such;

(2) Any known or expected impacts of the differences between the new and predicate products on the product stability. If no impact is known or expected, state that;

(3) Stability data assessed at the beginning (zero time), middle, and end of the expected shelf life. If a tobacco product does not have a defined shelf life, provide stability data over a specified amount of time and a justification for why that time period is appropriate. Stability testing must be performed for the microbial and chemical endpoints as follows:

(i) Microbial content data including total aerobic microbial count and total yeast and mold count;

(ii) Water activity; and

(iii) Tobacco-specific nitrosamine yields (total, N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), and 4-methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pydridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK)).

(4) Stability testing details for each microbial and chemical endpoint, including:

(i) The mean quantity and variance with unit of measure;

(ii) The number of samples and measurement replicates for each sample;

(iii) The methods used, associated reference(s), and full validation reports for each method (as applicable);

(iv) The testing laboratory or laboratories and documentation showing that the laboratory or laboratories is (or are) accredited by a nationally or internationally recognized external accreditation organization;

(v) Length of time between dates of tobacco product manufacture and date(s) of testing;

(vi) Storage conditions of the tobacco products before they were tested;

(vii) A statement that the testing was performed on a tobacco product in the same container closure system in which the tobacco product is intended to be marketed; and

(viii) Full test data (including test protocols, any deviation(s) from the test protocols, quantitative acceptance (pass/fail) criteria, complete data sets, and a summary of the results) for all stability testing performed.
