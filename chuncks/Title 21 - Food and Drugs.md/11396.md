(iv) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement should be used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to () its toxicity; () the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; () possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; () and its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.

(c) For the purpose of this section, the provisions do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.
