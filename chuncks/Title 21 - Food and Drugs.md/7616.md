(a)For the purpose of this section, polyhydric alcohol esters of long chain monobasic acids consist of polyhydric alcohol esters having number average molecular weights in the range of 1,050 to 1,700. The esters are produced by the reaction of either ethylene glycol or glycerol with long chain monobasic acids containing from 9 to 49 carbon atoms obtained by the ozonization of long chain-olefins, the unreacted carboxylic acids in the formation of the glycerol esters being neutralized with calcium hydroxide to produce a composition having up to 2 percent by weight calcium. The-olefins, obtained from the polymerization of ethylene, have 20 to 50 carbon atoms and contain a minimum of 75 percent by weight straight chain-olefins and not more than 25 percent vinylidene compounds.
