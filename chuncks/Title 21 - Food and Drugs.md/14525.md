###### Limitations.

(3)Insert implant subcutaneously in the ear only; then immediately inject solution intramuscularly only. Counting the day of implantation as day 1, remove the implant on day 10. Collect all implants as they are removed and burn them. While animals are restrained for artificial insemination, avoid other treatments such as vaccinations, dipping, pour-on grub and louse prevention, spraying, etc. When inseminating without estrus detection, the entire treated group should be started at 48 hours after the last implant has been removed and should be completed within 6 hours. Where estrus detection is preferred, insemination should be approximately 12 hours after first detection of estrus. Those that do not conceive can be re-bred when they return to estrus approximately 17 to 25 days after implant removal. Do not use in cows producing milk for human consumption.
