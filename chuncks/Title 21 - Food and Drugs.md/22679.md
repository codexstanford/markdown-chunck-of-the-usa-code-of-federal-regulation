####### Identification.

(a)A manual percutaneous surgical set assembled in the abdomen is a prescription device consisting of a percutaneous surgical set used as a means to penetrate soft tissue to access certain areas of the abdomen. The device's effectors or attachments are provided separately from the percutaneous shaft and are introduced to the site via a traditional conduit such as a trocar. The attachment or effectors are connected to the shaft once the tip of the shaft is inside the abdomen. Once inside the abdomen, the surgical set is used to grasp, hold, and manipulate soft tissues. A surgical instrument that has specialized uses in a specific medical specialty is classified in separate regulations in parts 868 through 892 of this chapter.
