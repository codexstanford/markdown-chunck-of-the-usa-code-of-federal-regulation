(a)serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies toin serum or to identifyin cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identifydirectly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of tularemia caused byand provides epidemiological information on this disease.
