####### Identification.

(a)A preformed (polymerized) absorbable lung biopsy plug is intended to provide accuracy in marking a biopsy location for visualization during surgical resection and closure of pleural punctures associated with percutaneous, transthoracic needle lung biopsies. Upon deployment into the biopsy tract, the plug expands to fill the biopsy void and remains in place until resorbed.
