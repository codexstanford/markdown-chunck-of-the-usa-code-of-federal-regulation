####### Identification.

(a)Mumps virus serological reagents consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to mumps virus in serum. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used in serological tests to identify mumps viruses from tissue culture isolates derived from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of mumps and provides epidemiological information on mumps. Mumps is an acute contagious disease, particularly in children, characterized by an enlargement of one or both of the parotid glands (glands situated near the ear), although other organs may also be involved.
