(2)The drug concentrations required are as follows:

(i) For control of external protozoan parasites on shrimp:

(ii) For control of external parasites on finfish:

(iii) For control of fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae on finfish eggs: Eggs of all finfish except Acipenseriformes, 1,000 to 2,000 µL/L (ppm) for 15 minutes; eggs of Acipenseriformes, up to 1,500 µL/L (ppm) for 15 minutes. A preliminary bioassay should be conducted on a small subsample of fish eggs to determine sensitivity before treating an entire group. This is necessary for all species because egg sensitivity can vary with species or strain and the unique conditions at each facility.

(iv) For the control of mortality in freshwater-reared finfish due to saprolegniasis associated with fungi in the family Saprolegniaceae: In tanks and raceways, administer 150 µL/L (ppm) for 60 minutes per day on alternate days for three treatments.
