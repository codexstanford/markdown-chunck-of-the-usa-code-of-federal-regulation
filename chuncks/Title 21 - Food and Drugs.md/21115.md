() The accuracy represents the degrees of agreement between the device results and the comparator results. The accuracy must be evaluated by measuring different percent agreements (PA) of device results with the comparator results and percent of `no calls' or `invalid calls.' Calculate the rate of `no calls' and `invalid calls' for each comparator output as %Inv(DD) = A/N%Inv(Dd) = B/N, %Inv(dd) = C/N. If `no calls' or `invalid calls' are required to be retested according to the device instructions for use, the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be provided. In the table presenting the results of the accuracy study, use only the final results (after retesting the initial `no calls' or `invalid calls', if required according to the instructions for use). Samples that resulted in a `no call' or `invalid call' after retesting must not be included in the final calculations of agreement. If the percentages of `no calls' or `invalid calls' for each comparator output are similar, combine these estimates as (A+ B+ C)/(N+ N+ N) and provide a 95 percent two-sided confidence interval. The percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be clinically acceptable.
