####### Nomenclature.

(2)The name of the food is "bottled water," "drinking water," or alternatively one or more of the following terms as appropriate:

(i) The name of water from a well tapping a confined aquifer in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer is "artesian water" or "artesian well water." Artesian water may be collected with the assistance of external force to enhance the natural underground pressure. On request, plants shall demonstrate to appropriate regulatory officials that the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer.

(ii) The name of water from a subsurface saturated zone that is under a pressure equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure is "ground water." Ground water must not be under the direct influence of surface water as defined in 40 CFR 141.2.

(iii) The name of water containing not less than 250 parts per million (ppm) total dissolved solids (TDS), coming from a source tapped at one or more bore holes or springs, originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source, may be "mineral water." Mineral water shall be distinguished from other types of water by its constant level and relative proportions of minerals and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source, due account being taken of the cycles of natural fluctuations. No minerals may be added to this water.
