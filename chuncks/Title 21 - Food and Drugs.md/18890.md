####### Output distortion control limits.

(1)Test the output distortion of the OTC hearing aid as follows to ensure that it does not exceed the limit specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) The total harmonic distortion plus noise shall not exceed 5 percent for output levels within one of the following sets of levels, depending on the test method:

(A) Using sine wave-based testing, measure at 70 dB SPL and 100 dB SPL; or

(B) Using a 500-hertz (Hz) one-third-octave pulsed-noise signal, measure at 67 dB SPL and 97 dB SPL.

(ii) You must measure the total harmonic distortion using a 500-Hz input tone with an analyzer that has a bandwidth at least as wide as the frequency limits of the OTC hearing aid.

(iii) You must measure the output distortion at the OTC hearing aid's maximum volume and the input sound level to the OTC hearing aid adjusted to produce the required outputs.
