() If odds ratios are available, using information about the genotype distribution either among individuals with the target disease absent, or in the general population, or information about the risk variant frequency and odds ratios, the likelihood ratios for the corresponding device results along with 95 percent confidence intervals must be calculated. Using information about pretest risk (π), an estimate of likelihood ratio (LR), and a relationship between post-test risk R as R/(1-R) = LR&#xB7;π/(1-π), the post-test risk R must be calculated.
