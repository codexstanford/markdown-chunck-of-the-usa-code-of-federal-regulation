(e)means the sucrose value as determined by the method prescribed in the "Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists," 13th Ed., 1980, sections 32.014 to 32.016 and 52.012, under the headings "Soluble Solids in Tomato Products Official Final Action" and "Refractive Indices (n) of Sucrose Solutions at 20&#xB0;," which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:If no salt has been added, the sucrose value obtained from the referenced tables shall be considered the percent of tomato soluble solids. If salt has been added either intentionally or through the application of the acidified break, determine the percent of such added sodium chloride as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Subtract the percentage so found from the percentage of total soluble solids found (sucrose value from the refractive index tables) and multiply the difference by 1.016. The resultant value is considered the percent of "tomato soluble solids."
