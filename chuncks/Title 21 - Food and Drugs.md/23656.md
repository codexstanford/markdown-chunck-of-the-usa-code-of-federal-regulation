####### Identification.

(a)A simulatan (including crossed cylinder) is a device that is a set of pairs of cylinder lenses that provides various equal plus and minus refractive strengths. The lenses are arranged so that the user can exchange the positions of plus and minus cylinder lenses of equal strengths. The device is intended for subjective refraction (refraction in which the patient judges whether a given object is clearly in focus, as the examiner uses different lenses).
