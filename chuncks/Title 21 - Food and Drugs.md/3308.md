####### e.g.,

(F) For declared subcomponents that have no DRVs or RDIs, a symbol (an asterisk) shall be placed in the "Percent Daily Value" column that shall refer to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the last heavy bar and inside the box, and followed by a statement "Daily Value not established."

(G) When calories or calories from saturated fat are declared, the space under the "% DV" column shall be left blank for these items. When there are no other (b)(2)-dietary ingredients listed for which a value must be declared in the "% DV" column, the column may be omitted as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(vii) of this section. When the "% DV" column is not required, but the dietary ingredients listed are subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, the symbol required in that paragraph shall immediately follow the quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient listed under "Amount Per Serving."
