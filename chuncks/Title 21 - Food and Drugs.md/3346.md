####### 2

() Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "[labeled product] 50 mg cholesterol per serving; [reference product] 30 mg cholesterol per serving") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(ii) For foods that contain more than 13 g of total fat per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving, or per 50 g if the reference amount customarily consumed is 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form):

(A) The food has been specifically formulated, altered, or processed to reduce its cholesterol by 25 percent or more from the reference food it resembles as defined in § 101.13(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as specified in § 101.13(d) that has a significant (i.e., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share;

(B) The food contains 2 g or less of saturated fatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed;

(C) The label or labeling discloses the level of total fat in a serving (as declared on the label) of the food. Such disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim preceding any disclosure statement required under § 101.13(h) in type that shall be no less than one-half the size of the type used for such claim. If the claim appears on more than one panel, the disclosure shall be made on each panel except for the panel that bears nutrition labeling. If the claim is made more than once on a panel, the disclosure shall be made in immediate proximity to the claim that is printed in the largest type; and

(D) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
