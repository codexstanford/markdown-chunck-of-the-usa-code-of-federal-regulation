####### Procedure.

(2)(i) Weigh all composite units in the sample while they are still hard frozen.

If the composite units were prepared using batters that are difficult to remove after one dipping, redip them for up to 5 seconds after the initial debreading and remove residual batter materials.

(iii) Remove the unit from the bath; blot lightly with double thickness of paper toweling; and scrape off or pick out coating from the shrimp material with the spatula or nut picker.

(iv) Weigh all the "debreaded" shrimp material.

(v) Calculate the percentage of shrimp material in the sample, using the following formula:
