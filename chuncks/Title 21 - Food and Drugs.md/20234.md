####### Identification.

(a)A breath nitric oxide test system is a device intended to measure fractional nitric oxide in human breath. Measurement of changes in fractional nitric oxide concentration in expired breath aids in evaluating an asthma patient's response to anti-inflammatory therapy, as an adjunct to established clinical and laboratory assessments of asthma. A breath nitric oxide test system combines chemiluminescence detection of nitric oxide with a pneumotachograph, display, and dedicated software.
