####### Identification.

(a)An automated heparin analyzer is a device used to determine the heparin level in a blood sample by mixing the sample with protamine (a heparin-neutralizing substance) and determining photometrically the onset of air-activated clotting. The analyzer also determines the amount of protamine necessary to neutralize the heparin in the patient's circulation.
