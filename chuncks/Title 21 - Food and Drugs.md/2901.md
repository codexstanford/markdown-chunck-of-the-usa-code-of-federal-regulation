(d)Feeding tests of this color additive have been conducted with three species:

(1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and 0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.

(2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was found.

(3) Dogs were fed FD&C Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5years on the test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.
