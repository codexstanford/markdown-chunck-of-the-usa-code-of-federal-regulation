###### ยง 201.80 Specific requirements on content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products; older drugs not described in ยง 201.56(b)(1).
####### Geriatric use.

(10)(i) A specific geriatric indication, if any, that is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population shall be described under the "Indications and Usage" section of the labeling, and appropriate geriatric dosage shall be stated under the "Dosage and Administration" section of the labeling. The "Geriatric use" subsection shall cite any limitations on the geriatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with the geriatric indication, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, information contained in the "Geriatric use" subsection of the labeling shall pertain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summarized in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under "Clinical Pharmacology" or the "Clinical Studies" section. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in "Contraindications," "Warnings," and elsewhere in "Precautions."

(ii) Specific statements on geriatric use of the drug for an indication approved for adults generally, as distinguished from a specific geriatric indication, shall be contained in the "Geriatric use" subsection and shall reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appropriate use of the drug in elderly patients. This information includes detailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-documented studies obtained from a literature search. Controlled studies include those that are part of the marketing application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug application, new drug application, biological license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applications (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The "Geriatric use" subsection shall contain the following statement(s) or reasonable alternative, as applicable, taking into account available information:

(A) If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the "Geriatric use" subsection shall include the following statement:

(B) If clinical studies (including studies that are part of marketing applications and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor's applications) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the "Geriatric use" subsection shall contain the following statement:

(C) If evidence from clinical studies and other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific monitoring or dosage adjustment, the "Geriatric use" subsection of the labeling shall contain a brief description of observed differences or specific monitoring or dosage requirements and, as appropriate, shall refer to more detailed discussions in the "Contraindications," "Warnings," "Dosage and Administration," or other sections of the labeling.

(iii)(A) If specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they shall be described briefly in the "Geriatric use" subsection of the labeling and in detail under the "Clinical Pharmacology" section. The "Clinical Pharmacology" section and "Drug interactions" subsection of the "Precautions" section ordinarily contain information on drug-disease and drug-drug interactions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to utilize concomitant drugs.

(B) If a drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the "Geriatric use" subsection shall include the statement:

(iv) If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in the "Geriatric use" subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the "Contraindications," "Warnings," or "Precautions" section of the labeling, and the "Geriatric use" subsection shall refer to those sections.

(v) Labeling under paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(iii) of this section may include statements, if they would be useful in enhancing safe use of the drug, that reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a particular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that:

(vi) If the sponsor believes that none of the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(v) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the statements if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling. FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if the agency determines that such statement is accurate and appropriate.
