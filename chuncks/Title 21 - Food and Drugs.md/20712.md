(a)serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies toin serum. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identifydirectly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of amebiasis caused by the microscopic protozoan parasiteand provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by this parasite. The parasite may invade the skin, liver, intestines, lungs, and diaphragm, causing disease conditions such as indolent ulcers, an amebic hepatitis, amebic dysentery, and pulmonary lesions.
