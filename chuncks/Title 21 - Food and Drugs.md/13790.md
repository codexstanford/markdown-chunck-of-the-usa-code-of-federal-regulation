Medicated cattle must actually consume enough medicated water which provides the recommended dosages. Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of sulfamethazine in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. Do not use in calves under one (1) month of age or calves being fed an all-milk diet. Use in these classes of calves may cause violative residues to remain beyond the withdrawal time. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.
