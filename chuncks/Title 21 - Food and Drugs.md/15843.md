(c)-(1)A small quantity should be sprayed on the affected surface by holding the container about 6 inches from the area to be treated and pressing the nozzle for 1 or 2 seconds. Only sufficient spray to coat the skin thinly is necessary. The application of small amounts at frequent intervals will give best results. Before treating animals with long or matted hair, it may be necessary to clip the affected area or spread the hairs to allow the medication to contact the skin surface. Relief may be noted following the first or second treatment; however, treatment should not be discontinued too soon after the initial favorable response has been obtained.
