###### § 101.62 Nutrient content claims for fat, fatty acid, and cholesterol content of foods.
####### Fat content claims.

(b)(1) The terms "fat free," "free of fat," "no fat," "zero fat," "without fat," "negligible source of fat," or "dietarily insignificant source of fat" or, in the case of milk products, "skim" may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, provided that:

(i) The food contains less than 0.5 gram (g) of fat per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving or, in the case of a meal product or main dish product, less than 0.5 g of fat per labeled serving; and

(ii) The food contains no added ingredient that is a fat or is generally understood by consumers to contain fat unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredient statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states "adds a trivial amount of fat," "adds a negligible amount of fat," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of fat;" and

(iii) As required in § 101.13(e)(2), if the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower fat content, it is labeled to disclose that fat is not usually present in the food (e.g., "broccoli, a fat free food").

(2) The terms "low fat," "low in fat," "contains a small amount of fat," "low source of fat," or "little fat" may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i)(A) The food has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 g or greater than 2 tablespoons and contains 3 g or less of fat per reference amount customarily consumed; or

(B) The food has a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less and contains 3 g or less of fat per reference amount customarily consumed and per 50 g of food (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form); and

(ii) If the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches (e.g., "frozen perch, a low fat food").

(3) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains 3 g or less of total fat per 100 g and not more than 30 percent of calories from fat; and

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(4) The terms "reduced fat," "reduced in fat," "fat reduced," "less fat," "lower fat," or "lower in fat" may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less fat per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the fat differs between the two foods and are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced fat-50 percent less fat than our regular brownies"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of fat in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Fat content has been reduced from 8 g to 4 g per serving.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in the labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the definition for "low fat."

(5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in the labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less fat per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the fat differs between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced fat spinach souffle, "33 percent less fat per 3 oz than our regular spinach souffle"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of fat in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Fat content has been reduced from 7.5 g per 3 oz to 5 g per 3 oz.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim, to the nutrition label, or, if the nutrition label is located on the information panel, it may appear elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in the labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the definition for "low fat."

(6) The term "__ percent fat free" may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that:

(i) The food meets the criteria for "low fat" in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section;

(ii) The percent declared and the words "fat free" are in uniform type size; and

(iii) A "100 percent fat free" claim may be made only on foods that meet the criteria for "fat free" in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that contain less than 0.5 g of fat per 100 g, and that contain no added fat.
