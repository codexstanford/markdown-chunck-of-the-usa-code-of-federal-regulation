(a) Polyestercarbonate resins (CAS Reg. No. 71519-80-7) are produced by the condensation of 4,4&#x2032;-isopropylidenediphenol, carbonyl chloride, terephthaloyl chloride, and isophthaloyl chloride such that the finished resins are composed of 45 to 85 molepercent ester, of which up to 55 mole-percent is the terephthaloyl isomer. The resins are manufactured using a phthaloyl chloride/carbonyl chloride mole ratio of 0.81 to 5.7/1 and isophthaloyl chloride/terephthaloyl chloride mole ratio of 0.81/1 or greater. The resins are also properly identified by CAS Reg. No. 114096-64-9 when produced with the use of greater than 2 but not greater than 5 weight percent-cumylphenol (CAS Reg. No. 599-64-4), as an optional adjuvant substance in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
