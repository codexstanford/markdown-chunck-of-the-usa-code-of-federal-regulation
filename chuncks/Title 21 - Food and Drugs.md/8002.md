(1) Ferric ammonium citrate (iron (III) ammonium citrate, CAS Reg. No. 1332-98-5) is a complex salt of undetermined structure composed of 16.5 to 18.5 percent iron, approximately 9 percent ammonia, and 65 percent citric acid and occurs as reddish brown or garnet red scales or granules or as a brownish-yellowish powder.

(2) Ferric ammonium citrate (iron (III) ammonium citrate, CAS Reg. No. 1333-00-2) is a complex salt of undetermined structure composed of 14.5 to 16 percent iron, approximately 7.5 percent ammonia, and 75 percent citric acid and occurs as thin transparent green scales, as granules, as a powder, or as transparent green crystals.
