####### Identification.

(a)Rubella virus serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to rubella virus in serum. The identification aids in the diagnosis of rubella (German measles) or confirmation of a person's immune status from past infections or immunizations and provides epidemiological information on German measles. Newborns infected in the uterus with rubella virus may be born with multiple congenital defects (rubella syndrome).
