###### Laser radiation emission indicator.

(5)(i) Each laser system classified as a Class II or IIIa laser product shall incorporate an emission indicator that provides a visible or audible signal during emission of accessible laser radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class I.

(ii) Each laser system classified as a Class IIIb or IV laser product shall incorporate an emission indicator which provides a visible or audible signal during emission of accessible laser radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class I, and sufficiently prior to emission of such radiation to allow appropriate action to avoid exposure to the laser radiation.

(iii) For laser systems manufactured on or before August 20, 1986, if the laser and laser energy source are housed separately and can be operated at a separation distance of greater than 2 meters, both laser and laser energy source shall incorporate an emission indicator as required in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section. For laser systems manufactured after August 20, 1986, each separately housed laser and operation control of a laser system that regulates the laser or collateral radiation emitted by a product during operation shall incorporate an emission indicator as required in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section, if the laser or operation control can be operated at a separation distance greater than 2 meters from any other separately housed portion of the laser product incorporating an emission indicator.

(iv) Any visible signal required by paragraph (f)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be clearly visible through protective eyewear designed specifically for the wavelength(s) of the emitted laser radiation.

(v) Emission indicators required by paragraph (f)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be located so that viewing does not require human exposure to laser or collateral radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class I and table VI.
