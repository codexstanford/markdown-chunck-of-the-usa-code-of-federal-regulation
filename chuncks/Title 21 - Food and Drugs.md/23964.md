####### Identification.

(a)A knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis is a device made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a femoral component with or without protuberance(s) for the enhancement of fixation and is limited to those prostheses intended for use without bone cement (ยง 888.3027).
