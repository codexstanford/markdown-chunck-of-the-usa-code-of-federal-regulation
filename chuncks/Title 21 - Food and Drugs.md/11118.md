###### ยง 352.73 Determination of SPF value.
####### Determination of the test product's SPF value and PCD.,i.e.

(d)Use data from at least 20 test subjects with n representing the number of subjects used. First, for each subject, compute the SPF value as stated in ยง 352.73(b) and (c). Second, compute the mean SPF value, x, and the standard deviation, s, for these subjects. Third, obtain the upper 5-percent point from the t distribution table with n-1 degrees of freedom. Denote this value by t. Fourth, compute ts/ &#x221A;n. Denote this quantity by A (, A = ts/ &#x221A;n). Fifth, calculate the SPF value to be used in labeling as follows: the label SPF equals the largest whole number less than x. - A. Sixth and last, the drug product is classified into a PCD as follows: if 30 + A <x, the PCD is High; if 12 + A <x<30 + A, the PCD is Moderate; if 2 + A <x<12 + A, the PCD is Minimal; if x<2 + A, the product shall not be labeled as a sunscreen drug product and shall not display an SPF value.
