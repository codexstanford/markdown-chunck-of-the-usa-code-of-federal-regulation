()Rapid evaporation of large volumes of solvent requires special precautions to prevent contamination by dust. This is facilitated by a special "gas" cover consisting of an inverted flat Pyrex crystallizing dish of an appropriate size (190 millimeters x 100 millimeters) to fit a 1-liter beaker. Through the center of the dish are sealed an inlet tube for preheated, oxygen-free nitrogen, and an outlet tube located 1 inch off center. Nitrogen is fed from the supply source through a coil of-inch stainless steel tubing immersed in the same steam bath used to supply heat for solvent evaporation. All connections are made with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing.
