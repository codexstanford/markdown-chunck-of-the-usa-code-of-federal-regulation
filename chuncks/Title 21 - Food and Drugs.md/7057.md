(c) The finished food-contact article shall not exceed 0.0076 centimeter (0.003 inch) thickness and shall contact foods only of the types identified in table 1 of ยง 176.170(c) of this chapter in Categories III, IV-A, VII-A, and IX under conditions of use F and G described in table 2 of ยง 176.170(c) of this chapter. Film samples of 0.0076 centimeter (0.003 inch) thickness representing the finished articles shall meet the following extractive limitation when tested by ASTM method F34-76 (Reapproved 1980), "Standard Test Method for Liquid Extraction of Flexible Barrier Materials," which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b) of this section. The film when extracted with-heptane at 38 &#xB0;C (100 &#xB0;F) for 30 minutes yields total extractives not to exceed 0.0078 milligram per square centimeter (0.05 milligram per square inch) of food-contact surface, after correcting the total extractives by dividing by a factor of five.
