####### Retort speed timing.

(7)The rotational speed of the retort shall be specified in the scheduled process. The speed shall be adjusted, as necessary, to ensure that the speed is as specified in the scheduled process. The rotational speed as well as the process time shall be recorded for each retort load processed. Alternatively, a recording tachometer may be used to provide a continuous record of the speed. A means of preventing unauthorized speed changes on retorts shall be provided. A lock or a notice from management posted at or near the speed-adjustment device that provides a warning that only authorized persons are permitted to make adjustments is a satisfactory means of preventing unauthorized changes.
