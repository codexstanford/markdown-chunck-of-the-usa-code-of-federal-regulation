###### ยง 320.27 Guidelines on the design of a multiple-dose in vivo bioavailability study.
####### Basic principles.

(a)(1) In selected circumstances it may be necessary for the test product and the reference material to be compared after repeated administration to determine steady-state levels of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety in the body.

(2) The test product and the reference material should be administered to subjects in the fasting or nonfasting state, depending upon the conditions reflected in the proposed labeling of the test product.

(3) A multiple-dose study may be required to determine the bioavailability of a drug product in the following circumstances:

(i) There is a difference in the rate of absorption but not in the extent of absorption.

(ii) There is excessive variability in bioavailability from subject to subject.

(iii) The concentration of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its metabolite(s), in the blood resulting from a single dose is too low for accurate determination by the analytical method.

(iv) The drug product is an extended release dosage form.
