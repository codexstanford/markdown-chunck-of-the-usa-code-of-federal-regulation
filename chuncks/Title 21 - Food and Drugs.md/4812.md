###### ยง 130.9 Sulfites in standardized food.

(a) Any standardized food that contains a sulfiting agent or combination of sulfiting agents that is functional and provided for in the applicable standard or that is present in the finished food at a detectable concentration is misbranded unless the presence of the sulfiting agent or agents is declared on the label of the food. A detectable amount of sulfiting agent is 10 parts per million (ppm or mg/kg) or more of the sulfite in the finished food. The concentration of sulfite in the finished food will be determined using either:

(1) Determination of Sulfite in Food by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry; or

(2) AOAC Official Method 990.28.

(b) Any standardized food that, as a result of actions that are consistent with current good manufacturing practice, contains an indirectly added sulfiting agent that has no functional effect in the food and that would, in the absence of ยง 101.100(a)(4) of this chapter, be considered to be an incidental additive for purposes of ยง 130.8, conforms to the applicable definition and standard of identity if the presence of the sulfiting agent is declared on the label of the food.
