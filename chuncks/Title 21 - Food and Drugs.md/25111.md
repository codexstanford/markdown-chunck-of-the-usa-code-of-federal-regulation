(8)All viewing optics, viewports, and display screens incorporated into a laser product, regardless of its class, shall limit the levels of laser and collateral radiation accessible to the human eye by means of such viewing optics, viewports, or display screens during operation or maintenance to less than the accessible emission limits of Class I and table VI. For any shutter or variable attenuator incorporated into such viewing optics, viewports, or display screens, a means shall be provided:

(i) To prevent access by the human eye to laser and collateral radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class I and table VI whenever the shutter is opened or the attenuator varied.

(ii) To preclude, upon failure of such means as required in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section, opening the shutter or varying the attenuator when access by the human eye is possible to laser or collateral radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class I and table VI.
