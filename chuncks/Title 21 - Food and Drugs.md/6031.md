(iii) The standards with which comparisons are made are essentially neutral matte-finish standards, equivalent in luminous reflectance of light of 555µ wavelength to 33.7 percent of the luminous reflectance of magnesium oxide (for Munsell value 6.3) and 22.6 percent of the luminous reflectance of magnesium oxide (for Munsell value 5.3), as given by the relationship between Munsell value and luminous reflectance derived by a subcommittee of the Optical Society of America and published in the "Journal of the Optical Society of America," Vol. 33, page 406 (1943), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-150), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

(iv) These standards shall be cut in circles 3inches in diameter and shall be mounted in 307 x 113 size containers, bearing a top seam and painted flat black inside and outside, so that the surfaces of the standards areinch below the top of the containers in which they are mounted.

(v) In the case of blended tuna, the foregoing method shall be varied by first separating the tuna flakes of the two different colors before passing them through the-inch mesh sieve, then proceeding with each portion separately for the determination of its color value, employing, if necessary, a sample container with false bottom greater thaninch deep.

(8)(i) The specified names of the canned tuna for which definitions and standards of identity are prescribed by this section, except where water is the packing medium or where the tuna is smoked, are formed by combining the designation of form of pack with the color designation of the tuna; for example, "Solid pack white tuna", "Grated dark tuna", etc. In the case of blended tuna, there shall be used both applicable color designations of the blended flakes, in precedence determined in accordance with the predominating portion found in the container; for example, "Blended white and dark tuna flakes", "Blended dark and light tuna flakes".

(ii) The specified name of canned tuna when water is used as the packing medium is formed as described in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, followed by the words "in water"; for example, "Grated light tuna in water".

(iii) When the packing medium is vegetable oil or olive oil, the label shall bear the name of the optional packing medium used, as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, preceded by the word "in" or the words "packed in". In case of the optional ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the name or names of the oil used may be stated, or the general term "vegetable oil" may be used.

(iv) In case solid pack tuna is packed in olive oil, the designation "Tonno" may also appear.

(v) In case any of the specified forms of canned tuna are smoked, the word "smoked" shall appear as a part of the name on the label; for example, "Smoked light tuna flakes".

(vi) Where the canned tuna contains one or more of the ingredients provided for in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the label shall bear the statement "Seasoned with ______", the blank being filled in with the name or names of the ingredient or ingredients used, except that if the ingredient designated in paragraph (a)(6)(v) of this section is used, the blank shall be filled in with the term "vegetable broth", and if the ingredients designated in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section are used, the blank may be filled in with the term "oil", and if the ingredient designated in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section is used alone, the label may alternatively bear either the statement "spiced" or the statement "with added spice"; and if salt is the only seasoning ingredient used, the label may alternatively bear any of the statements "salted", "with added salt", or "salt added". If the flavoring ingredients designated in paragraph (a)(6)(vii) of this section are used, the words "lemon flavored" or "with lemon flavoring" shall appear as part of the name on the label; for example, "lemon flavored chunk light tuna". Citric acid and any optional solubilizing and dispersing agent used as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(vii) of this section in connection with lemon flavoring ingredients or emulsifying and suspending ingredients used as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section shall be designated on the label by their common or usual name.

(vii) Where the canned tuna contains the optional ingredient sodium acid pyrophosphate as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the statement "pyrophosphate added" or "with added pyrophosphate".

(viii) Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the names of the optional ingredients used, as specified in paragraphs (a)(8)(iii), (vi), and (vii) of this section (except if lemon flavoring is added, this subparagraph applies only to the terms "lemon flavored" or "with lemon flavoring", not to the constituent ingredients of that flavoring or to any optional solubilizing or dispersing ingredient used in connection with lemon flavoring ingredients), shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name without intervening, written, printed, or graphic matter except that the common name of the species of tuna fish may so intervene; but the species name "albacore" may be employed only for canned tuna of that species which meets the color designation "white" as prescribed by paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.

(ix) Statements of optional ingredients present required by paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, but not subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(8)(viii) of this section shall be set forth on the label with such prominence and conspicuousness as to render them likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase.
