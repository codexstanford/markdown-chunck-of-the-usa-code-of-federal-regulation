###### ยง 120.8 Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan.
####### HACCP plan.

(a)Each processor shall have and implement a written HACCP plan whenever a hazard analysis reveals one or more food hazards that are reasonably likely to occur during processing, as described in ยง 120.7. The HACCP plan shall be developed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with ยง 120.13 and shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of ยง 120.12. A HACCP plan shall be specific to:

(1) Each location where juice is processed by that processor; and

(2) Each type of juice processed by the processor. The plan may group types of juice products together, or group types of production methods together, if the food hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and procedures required to be identified and performed by paragraph (b) of this section are essentially identical, provided that any required features of the plan that are unique to a specific product or method are clearly delineated in the plan and are observed in practice.
