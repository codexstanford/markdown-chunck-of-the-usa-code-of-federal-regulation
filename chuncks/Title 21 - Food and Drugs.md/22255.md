####### Classification.

(b)Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) Clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use, including evaluation of all adverse events.

(2) Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use. Testing must include:

(i) Verification of cochlear implant attachment force, release force, and insertion speed;

(ii) Testing to demonstrate the device does not damage or degrade the cochlear implant (including the lead and array portions of the cochlear implant); and

(iii) Comparison testing with manual insertion to evaluate:

(A) Differences in cochlear implant array insertion force associated with use of the device; and

(B) Intracochlear placement of the cochlear implant array (intended scala placement and array insertion depth, together with minimal array tip foldover and cochlear scala translocation).
