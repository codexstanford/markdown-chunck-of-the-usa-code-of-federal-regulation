####### Importers.

(d)(1) An Importer of an eligible prescription drug must purchase the drug directly from a Foreign Seller in Canada.

(2) Upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug in a transaction from the Foreign Seller, an Importer must facilitate the affixation or imprinting of a product identifier, as defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for all eligible prescription drugs. The Importer must ensure that such affixation or imprinting occurs at the same time the product is relabeled with the required U.S.-approved labeling for the drug product and, except for repackaging necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part, cannot otherwise relabel or repackage the product. The Importer may affix or imprint the product identifier, or the Importer may contract with an entity registered with FDA under part 207 of this chapter to accomplish such relabeling, provided that the entity does not otherwise relabel or repackage the product, except for repackaging that is necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part. Any entity with which the Importer contracts to accomplish such labeling must, even if not engaged in a repackaging operation with respect to the eligible prescription drug, have systems and processes in place to meet applicable requirements of a "repackager" under section 582(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for any transaction involving the eligible prescription drug.

(3) The repackager that affixes or imprints the product identifier on each package and homogenous case of an eligible prescription drug in accordance with section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which may be the Importer or the Importer's authorized repackager-

(i) May affix or imprint a product identifier only on a package of an eligible prescription drug that has a serial number that was assigned and affixed by the Foreign Seller;

(ii) Must maintain the product identifier information for such drug for not less than 6 years; and

(iii) Must maintain records for not less than 6 years that associate the product identifier the repackager affixes or imprints with the serial number assigned by the Foreign Seller and the Canadian DIN.

(4) An Importer must retain records, for not less than 6 years, that allow the Importer to associate the product identifier affixed or imprinted on each package or homogenous case of product it received from the Foreign Seller, with the SSI that had been assigned by the Foreign Seller, and the Canadian DIN that was on the package when the Foreign Seller received the product from the manufacturer.

(5) An Importer must, upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug and records from a Foreign Seller, compare such information with information the Importer received from the manufacturer, including relevant documentation about the transaction that the manufacturer provided to the Foreign Seller upon its transfer of ownership of the product for the Canadian market.

(6) An Importer must comply with all applicable requirements of section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including requirements that apply to subsequent transactions with trading partners, unless a waiver, exception, or exemption applies.

(7) For transactions of eligible prescription drugs between Importers and Foreign Sellers under a SIP, an Importer is exempt from the following specific supply chain security requirements that are otherwise applicable:

(i) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on receiving a product for which the previous owner did not provide the transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement, under sections 582(c)(1)(A) or (d)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable, provided that the Importer receives from the Foreign Seller the information required under paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on receiving a product that is not encoded with a product identifier, under sections 582(c)(2) or (d)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable, provided that the product the Importer received from the Foreign Seller has an SSI.

(iii) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on conducting a transaction with an entity that is not an "authorized trading partner," under sections 582(c)(3) or (d)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable.

(iv) An Importer is exempt from the requirement to verify that a product in the Importer's possession or control contains a "standardized numerical identifier" at the package level, under sections 582(c)(4)(A)(i)(II) or (d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as applicable, provided that the Importer verifies that each package and homogenous case of the product includes the SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller.
