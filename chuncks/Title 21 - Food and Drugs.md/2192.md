####### Identity.

(a)(1) The color additive pyrophyllite is a naturally occurring mineral substance consisting predominantly of a hydrous aluminum silicate, AlO&#xB7;4SiO&#xB7;HO, intimately mixed with lesser amounts of finely divided silica, SiO. Small amounts, usually less than 3 percent, of other silicates, such as potassium aluminum silicate, may be present. Pyrophyllite may be identified and semiquantitatively determined by its characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern and by its optical properties.

(2) Color additive mixtures made with pyrophyllite are limited to those listed in this subpart as safe and suitable in color additive mixtures for coloring externally applied drugs.
