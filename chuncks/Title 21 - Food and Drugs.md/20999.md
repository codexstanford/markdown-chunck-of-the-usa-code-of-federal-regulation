####### Identification.

(a)A lactic dehydrogenase immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the activity of the lactic dehydrogenase enzyme in serum. Increased levels of lactic dehydrogenase are found in a variety of conditions, including megaloblastic anemia (decrease in the number of mature red blood cells), myocardial infarction (heart disease), and some forms of leukemia (cancer of the blood-forming organs). However, the diagnostic usefulness of this device is limited because of the many conditions known to cause increased lactic dehydrogenase levels.
