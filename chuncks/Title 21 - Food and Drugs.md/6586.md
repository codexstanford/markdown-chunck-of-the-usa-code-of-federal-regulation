(2) When aspartame is used in baked goods and baking mixes, the amount of the additive is not to exceed 0.5 percent by weight of ready-to-bake products or of finished formulations prior to baking. Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients or food additives approved for use in baked goods shall be used in combination with aspartame to ensure its functionality as a sweetener in the final baked product. The level of aspartame used in these products is determined by an analytical method entitled "Analytical Method for the Determination of Aspartame and Diketopiperazine in Baked Goods and Baking Mixes," October 8, 1992, which was developed by the Nutrasweet Co.
