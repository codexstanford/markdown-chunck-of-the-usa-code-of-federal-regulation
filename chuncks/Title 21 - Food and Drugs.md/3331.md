###### § 101.60 Nutrient content claims for the calorie content of foods.
####### Sugar content claims,Use of terms such as "sugar free," "free of sugar," "no sugar," "zero sugar," "without sugar," "sugarless," "trivial source of sugar," "negligible source of sugar," or "dietarily insignificant source of sugar."

(c)-(1)Consumers may reasonably be expected to regard terms that represent that the food contains no sugars or sweeteners e.g., "sugar free," or "no sugar," as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a food may not be labeled with such terms unless:

(i) The food contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 101.9(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving or, in the case of a meal product or main dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving; and

(ii) The food contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredient statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states "adds a trivial amount of sugar," "adds a negligible amount of sugar," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;" and

(iii)(A) It is labeled "low calorie" or "reduced calorie" or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section, or, if a dietary supplement, it meets the definition in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for "low calorie" but is prohibited by §§ 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim; or

(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement "not a reduced calorie food," "not a low calorie food," or "not for weight control."

(2) The terms "no added sugar," "without added sugar," or "no sugar added" may be used only if:

(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 101.9(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging; and

(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice; and

(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a food, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results; and

(iv) The food that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and

(v) The product bears a statement that the food is not "low calorie" or "calorie reduced" (unless the food meets the requirements for a "low" or "reduced calorie" food) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.

(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a food, including foods intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a food that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.

(4) The claims provided for in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section may be used on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age.

(5) The terms "reduced sugar," "reduced in sugar," "sugar reduced," "less sugar," "lower sugar" or "lower in sugar" may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l), main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), and dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less sugar per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugar differs between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "these corn flakes contain 25 percent less sugar than our sugar coated corn flakes"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(6) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section may be used on the label or in the labeling of a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l) and a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1), and

(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced sweet and sour shrimp dinner, "25 percent less sugar per 3 oz than our regular sweet and sour shrimp dinner"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.
