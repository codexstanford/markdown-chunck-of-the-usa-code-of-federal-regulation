#### PART 81 - GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS AND GENERAL RESTRICTIONS FOR PROVISIONAL COLOR ADDITIVES FOR USE IN FOODS, DRUGS, AND COSMETICS
##### ยง 81.10 Termination of provisional listings of color additives.
###### D&C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13.

(h)The petition for these color additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned of the possible contamination of D&C Red No. 10, D&C Red No. 11, D&C Red No. 12, and D&C Red No. 13 with &#x3B2;-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that they will not contain &#x3B2;-naphthylamine as an impurity or not yield &#x3B2;-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary colors present in them. &#x3B2;-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&C Red No. 10, D&C Red No. 11, D&C Red No. 12, and D&C Red No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
