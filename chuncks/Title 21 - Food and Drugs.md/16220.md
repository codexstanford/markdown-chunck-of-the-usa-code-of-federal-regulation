(2)(i) Initial bioassay on a small number is recommended before treating the entire group.

(ii) Eggs: Some strains of rainbow trout eggs are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment at a time during incubation concurrent with blastopore formation through closure, about 70 to 140 Daily Temperature Units, &#xB0;C.
