####### Identity.

(a)(1) The color additive mica is a white powder obtained from the naturally occurring mineral, muscovite mica, consisting predominantly of a potassium aluminum silicate, KAl(AlSiO)(OH)or, alternatively, HKAl(SiO). Mica may be identified and semiquantitatively determined by its characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern and by its optical properties.

(2) Color additive mixtures for drug use made with mica may contain only those diluents listed in this subpart as safe and suitable for use in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs.
