####### Identification.

(a)A medical bassinet is a prescription device that is a small bed intended for use with pediatric patients, generally from birth to approximately 5 months of age. It is intended for medical purposes for use in a nursery, labor and delivery unit, or patient room, but may also be used outside of traditional health care settings. A medical bassinet is a non-powered device that consists of two components: The plastic basket or bed component and a durable frame with wheels, which holds the basket or bed component. The basket or bed component is a box-like structure, generally made of a clear, high impact-resistant plastic material, with an open top and four stationary walls to hold the pediatric patient. The frame can include drawers, shelving, or cabinetry that provides space to hold infant care items. The wheels or casters allow the bassinet to transport the infant throughout the care setting.
