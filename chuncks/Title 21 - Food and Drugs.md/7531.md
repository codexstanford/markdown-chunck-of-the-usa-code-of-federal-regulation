(16) An aqueous solution containing equal amounts ofalkyl (C-C) benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride andalkyl (C-C) dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (having average molecular weights of 377 to 384), with the optional adjuvant substances tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate and/or(nonylphenol)hydroxy poly (oxyethylene) having an average poly- (oxyethylene) content of 11 moles. Alpha-hydro-omega-hydroxypoly-(oxyethylene) poly(oxypropoylene) (15 to 18 mole minimum) poly (oxyethylene) block copolymer, having a minimum molecular weight of 1,900 (CAS Registry No. 9003-11-6) may be used in lieu of alpha- (-nonylphenol)-omega-hydroxy- poly(oxyethylene) having an average poly(oxyethylene) content of 11 moles. In addition to use on food-processing equipment and utensils, this solution may be used on food-contact surfaces in public eating places.
