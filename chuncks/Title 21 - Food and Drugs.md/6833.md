####### Calculation.

(5)The calculation method used is that described in appendix X 1.3 (ASTM method D1243-79, "Standard Test Method for Dilute Solution Viscosity of Vinyl Chloride Polymers," which is incorporated by reference; see paragraph (b) of this section for availability of the incorporation by reference) with the reduced viscosity determined for three concentration levels not greater than 0.5 gram per deciliter and extrapolated to zero concentration for intrinsic viscosity. The following formula is used for determining reduced viscosity:
