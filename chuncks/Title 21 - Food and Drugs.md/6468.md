Synthetic paraffin and succinic derivatives identified in this section may be safely used as a component of food, subject to the following restrictions:

(a) The additive is prepared with 50 percent Fischer-Tropsch process synthetic paraffin, meeting the definition and specifications of ยง 172.615, and 50 percent of such synthetic paraffin to which is bonded succinic anhydride and succinic acid derivatives of isopropyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol. It consists of a mixture of the Fischer-Tropsch process paraffin (alkane), alkyl succinic anhydride, alkyl succinic anhydride isopropyl half ester, dialkyl succinic anhydride polyethylene glycol half ester, and dialkyl succinic anhydride polypropylene glycol half ester, where the alkane (alkyl) has a chain length of 30-70 carbon atoms and the polyethylene and polypropylene glycols have molecular weights of 600 and 260, respectively.

(b) The additive meets the following specifications: Molecular weight, 880-930; melting point, 215&#xB0;-217 &#xB0;F; acid number, 43-47; and saponification number, 75-78.

(c) It is used or intended for use as a protective coating or component of protective coatings for fresh grapefruit, lemons, limes, muskmelons, oranges, sweetpotatoes, and tangerines.
