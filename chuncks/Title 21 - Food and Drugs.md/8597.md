"Possibly" effective: ().

Final classification of the less-than-effective indications requires further investigation.

(3) In drug labeling (other than that which is required by ยง 201.100(c)(1)) which may contain a promotional message, the promotional message shall be keyed to the boxed statement by the same means as those provided for advertisements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(f) Qualifying information required in prescription drug advertising by paragraph (c) of this section shall contain a prominent boxed statement of the advertised indication(s) and of the limitations of effectiveness using the same format, language, and emphasis as that required in labeling by paragraph (e) of this section.

(1) The boxed statement shall appear in (or next to) the information required in brief summary by ยง 202.1(e)(1) of this chapter and shall have prominence at least equal to that provided for other information presented in the brief summary and shall have type size, captions, color, and other physical characteristics comparable to the information required in the brief summary.

(2) Less-than-effective indication(s) in the promotional message of an advertisement which is a single page or less shall be keyed to the boxed statement by asterisk, by an appropriate statement, or by other suitable means providing adequate emphasis on the boxed statement. On each page where less-than-effective indication(s) appear in a mutiple page advertisement, an asterisk shall be placed after the most prominent mention of the indi- cation(s); if the degree of prominence does not vary, an asterisk shall be placed after the first mention of the indication. The asterisk shall refer to a notation at the bottom of the page which shall state "This drug has been evaluated as probably effective (or possibly effective whichever is appropriate) for this indication" and "See Brief Summary" or "See Prescribing Information," the latter legend to be used only if the advertisement carries the required information for professional use as set forth in ยง 201.100(c)(1).

(3) For less-than-effective indications which are included in the advertisement only as a part of the information required in brief summary, the disclosure information shall appear in this portion of the advertisement in the same manner as is specified for labeling in paragraph (e) of this section.

(g) The Commissioner may find circumstances are such that, while the elimination of claims evaluated as other than effective will generally eliminate the need for disclosure about such claims, there will be instances in which the change in the prescribing or promotional profile of the drug is so substantial as to require a disclosure of the reason for the change so that the purchaser or prescriber is not misled by being left unaware through the sponsor's silence that a basic change has taken place. The Food and Drug Administration will identify these situations in direct correspondence with the drug promoters, after which the failure to make the disclosure will be regarded as misleading and appropriate action will be taken.
