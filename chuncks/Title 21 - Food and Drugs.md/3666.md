####### Process and pH information availability.

(ii)When requested by the Food and Drug Administration in writing, a commercial processor engaged in the processing of acidified foods shall provide the Food and Drug Administration with any process and procedure information that the Food and Drug Administration deems necessary to determine the adequacy of the process. Furnishing of this information does not constitute approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the content of the information filed, and the information concerning processes and other data so furnished shall be considered trade secrets within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 331(j) and 18 U.S.C. 1905 (to the extent that they qualify under those provisions).

(d) A commercial processor engaged in the processing of acidified foods shall promptly report to the Food and Drug Administration any instance of spoilage, process deviation, or contamination with microorganisms, the nature of which has potential health-endangering significance, where any lot of such food has in whole or in part entered distribution in commerce.

(e) A commercial processor engaged in the processing of acidified foods shall prepare and maintain files on a current procedure for use for products under the processor's control, which that processor will ask the distributor to follow, including plans for recalling products that may be injurious to health; for identifying, collecting, warehousing, and controlling products; for determining the effectiveness of recalls; for notifying the Food and Drug Administration of any recalls; and for implementing recall programs.

(f) All plant personnel involved in acidification, pH control, heat treatment, or other critical factors of the operation shall be under the operating supervision of a person who has attended a school approved by the Commissioner for giving instruction in food-handling techniques, food protection principles, personal hygiene, plant sanitation practices, pH controls, and critical factors in acidification, and who has satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of instruction. The Commissioner will consider students who have satisfactorily completed the required portions of the courses presented under ยง 108.35 and part 113 of this chapter before March 16, 1979, as having satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of instruction under this section and part 114 of this chapter. The Commissioner will not withhold approval of any school qualified to give such instruction.

(g) A commercial processor engaged in the processing of acidified foods shall prepare, review, and retain at the processing plant or other reasonably accessible location for a period of 3 years from the date of manufacture, all records of processing, deviations in processing, pH, and other records specified in part 114 of this chapter. Upon written demand during the course of a factory inspection under section 704 of the act by a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration, a commercial processor shall permit the inspection and copying by that employee of these records to verify the pH and the adequacy of processing.
