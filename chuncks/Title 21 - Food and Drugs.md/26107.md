### PART 1300 - DEFINITIONS
#### ยง 1300.03 Definitions relating to electronic orders for controlled substances and electronic prescriptions for controlled substances.
##### Signing function

means any keystroke or other action used to indicate that the practitioner has authorized for transmission and dispensing a controlled substance prescription. The signing function may occur simultaneously with or after the completion of the two-factor authentication protocol that meets the requirements of part 1311 of this chapter. The signing function may have different names (e.g., approve, sign, transmit), but it serves as the practitioner's final authorization that he intends to issue the prescription for a legitimate medical reason in the normal course of his professional practice.
