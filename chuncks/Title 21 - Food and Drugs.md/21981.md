####### Identification.

(a)A partially fabricated denture kit is a device composed of connected preformed teeth that is intended for use in construction of a denture. A denture base is constructed using the patient's mouth as a mold, by partially polymerizing the resin denture base materials while the materials are in contact with the oral tissues. After the denture base is constructed, the connected preformed teeth are chemically bonded to the base.
