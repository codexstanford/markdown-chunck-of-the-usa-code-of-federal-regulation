###### ยง 101.83 Health claims: plant sterol/stanol esters and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
####### Significance of the relationship between diets that include plant sterol/stanol esters and the risk of CHD.

(b)(1) CHD is a major public health concern in the United States. It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.

(2) The scientific evidence establishes that including plant sterol/stanol esters in the diet helps to lower blood total and LDL cholesterol levels.
