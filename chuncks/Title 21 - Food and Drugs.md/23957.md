####### Identification.

(a)A knee joint patellofemorotibial polymer/metal/metal constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a knee joint. The device prevents dislocation in more than one anatomic plane and has components that are linked together. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have a femoral component, a tibial component, a cylindrical bolt and accompanying locking hardware that are all made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a retropatellar resurfacing component made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The retropatellar surfacing component may be attached to the resected patella either with a metallic screw or bone cement. All stemmed metallic components within this generic type are intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027).
