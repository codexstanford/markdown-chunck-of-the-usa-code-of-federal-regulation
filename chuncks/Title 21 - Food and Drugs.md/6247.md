###### ยง 165.110 Bottled water.
####### Radiological quality.

(5)(i) Bottled water shall, when a composite of analytical units of equal volume from a sample is examined by the methods described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, meet standards of radiological quality as follows:

(A) The bottled water shall not contain a combined radium-226 and radium-228 activity in excess of 5 picocuries per liter of water.

(B) The bottled water shall not contain a gross alpha particle activity (including radium-226, but excluding radon and uranium) in excess of 15 picocuries per liter of water.

(C) The bottled water shall not contain beta particle and photon radioactivity from manmade radionuclides in excess of that which would produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body or any internal organ of 4 millirems per year calculated on the basis of an intake of 2 liters of the water per day. If two or more beta or photon-emitting radionuclides are present, the sum of their annual dose equivalent to the total body or to any internal organ shall not exceed 4 millirems per year.

(D) The bottled water shall not contain uranium in excess of 30 micrograms per liter of water.
