(a)Polyarylsulfone resins are copolymers containing not more than 25 percent of oxy--phenylene-oxy--phenylenesulfonyl-phenylene polymer units and not less than 75 percent of oxy--phenylenesulfonyl--phenylene-oxy--phenylenesulfonyl--phenylene polymer units. The copolymers have a minimum reduced viscosity of 0.40 deciliter per gram in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in accordance with ASTM method D2857-70 (Reapproved 1977), "Standard Test Method for Dilute Solution Viscosity of Polymers," which is incorporated by reference.
