####### Identification.

(a)A flow cytometric test for hematopoietic neoplasms is a device that consists of reagents for immunophenotyping of human cells in relation to the level of expression, antigen density, and distribution of specific cellular markers.

The results should be interpreted by a pathologist or equivalent professional in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.
