####### Particular implied nutrient content claims.

(c)(1) Claims about the food or an ingredient therein that suggest that a nutrient or an ingredient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., "high in oat bran") are implied nutrient content claims and must comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) The phrases "contains the same amount of [nutrient] as a [food]" and "as much [nutrient] as a [food]" may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that the amount of the nutrient in the reference food is enough to qualify that food as a "good source" of that nutrient, and the labeled food, on a per serving basis, is an equivalent, good source of that nutrient (e.g., "as much fiber as an apple," "Contains the same amount of Vitamin C as an 8 oz glass of orange juice.").

(3) Claims may be made that a food contains or is made with an ingredient that is known to contain a particular nutrient, or is prepared in a way that affects the content of a particular nutrient in the food, if the finished food is either "low" in or a "good source" of the nutrient that is associated with the ingredient or type of preparation. If a more specific level is claimed (e.g., "high in ______), that level of the nutrient must be present in the food. For example, a claim that a food contains oat bran is a claim that it is a good source of dietary fiber; that a food is made only with vegetable oil is a claim that it is low in saturated fat; and that a food contains no oil is a claim that it is fat free.
