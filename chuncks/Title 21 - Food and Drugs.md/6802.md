Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid has the empirical formula CFSOH (CAS Reg. No. 1493-13-6). The catalyst (Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid) may safely be used in the production of cocoa butter substitute from palm oil (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin) (see ยง 184.1259 of this chapter) in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) The catalyst meets the following specifications:

(b) It is used at levels not to exceed 0.2 percent of the reaction mixture to catalyze the directed esterification.

(c) The esterification reaction is quenched with steam and water and the catalyst is removed with the aqueous phase. Final traces of catalyst are removed by washing batches of the product three times with an aqueous solution of 0.5 percent sodium bicarbonate.
