###### ยง 880.6887 Spore test strip.
####### Identification.

(a)The spore test strip consists of a carrier or strip with a known number of spores, at least 5 logper strip, of known resistance to a particular liquid chemical sterilant in a liquid chemical sterilant processing system. A "no growth" result from the spore test strip after the specified predetermined incubation period indicates that the liquid chemical sterilization process achieved the conditions necessary to kill the specified minimum number of viable spores on the test strip which is 5 logspores/strip; it does not confirm the expected full performance of the liquid chemical sterilant processing cycle because full performance is a 6 logspore kill in a full liquid chemical sterilization cycle.
