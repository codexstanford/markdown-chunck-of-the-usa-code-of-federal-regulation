####### Identification.

(a)An early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test system for specimen characterization is a device intended to detect the EGR1 probe target on chromosome 5q in bone marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The assay results are intended to be interpreted only by a qualified pathologist or cytogeneticist. These devices do not include automated systems that directly report results without review and interpretation by a qualified pathologist or cytogeneticist. These devices also do not include any device intended for use to select patient therapy, predict patient response to therapy, or to screen for disease as well as any device with a claim for a particular diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, or risk assessment.
