(ii) Alternatively, the net acidified chloroform-soluble extractives shall not exceed 0.05 milligram/square inch(0.078 mg/square centimeter) of food-contact surface (water, acetic acid, or ethanol/water extractions) when extracted by the equilibrium method cited in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. If when exposed to-heptane, a particular film splits along die lines, thus permitting exposure of both sides of the film to the extracting solvent, the results for that film sample are invalid and the test must be repeated for that sample until no splitting by the solvent occurs. If the finished food-contact article is itself the subject of a regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and ยง 179.45 of this chapter, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed for it by that regulation.
