###### ยง 514.8 Supplements and other changes to an approved application.
####### Labeling changes to be placed into effect prior to receipt of a written notice of approval of a supplemental application.

(3)(i) Labeling changes of the following kinds that increase the assurance of drug safety proposed in supplemental applications must be placed into effect immediately:

(A) The addition to package labeling, promotional labeling, or prescription drug advertising of additional warning, contraindication, adverse reaction, and precaution information;

(B) The deletion from package labeling, promotional labeling, or drug advertising of false, misleading, or unsupported intended uses or claims for effectiveness; and

(C) Any other changes as directed by FDA.

(ii) Labeling changes (for example, design and style) that do not decrease safety of drug use proposed in supplemental applications may be placed into effect prior to written notice of approval from FDA of a supplemental application.

(iii) A supplement submitted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section must include the following information:

(A) A full explanation of the basis for the changes, the date on which such changes are being effected, and plainly marked on the mailing cover and on the supplement, "Supplement-Labeling Changes Being Effected";

(B) Two sets of printed copies of any revised labeling to be placed in use, identified with the new animal drug application number; and

(C) A statement by the applicant that all promotional labeling and all drug advertising will promptly be revised consistent with the changes made in the labeling on or within the new animal drug package no later than upon approval of the supplemental application.

(iv) If the supplemental application is not approved and the drug is being distributed with the proposed labeling, FDA may initiate an enforcement action because the drug is misbranded under section 502 of the act and/or adulterated under section 501 of the act. In addition, under section 512(e) of the act, FDA may, after due notice and opportunity for a hearing, issue an order withdrawing approval of the application.
