####### Identity.

(a)(1) The color additive grape color extract is an aqueous solution of anthocyanin grape pigments made from Concord grapes or a dehydrated water soluble powder prepared from the aqueous solution. The aqueous solution is prepared by extracting the pigments from precipitated lees produced during the storage of Concord grape juice. It contains the common components of grape juice, namely anthocyanins, tartrates, malates, sugars, and minerals, etc., but not in the same proportion as found in grape juice. The dehydrated water soluble powder is prepared by spray drying the aqueous solution containing added malto-dextrin.

(2) Color additive mixtures for food use made with grape color extract may contain only those diluents listed in this subpart as safe and suitable in color additive mixtures for coloring foods.
