####### Identification.

(a)A hydrogel wound dressing is a sterile or non-sterile device intended to cover a wound, to absorb wound exudate, to control bleeding or fluid loss, and to protect against abrasion, friction, desiccation, and contamination. It consists of a nonresorbable matrix made of hydrophilic polymers or other material in combination with water (at least 50 percent) and capable of absorbing exudate. This classification does not include a hydrogel wound dressing that contains added drugs such as antimicrobial agents, added biologics such as growth factors, or is composed of materials derived from animal sources.
