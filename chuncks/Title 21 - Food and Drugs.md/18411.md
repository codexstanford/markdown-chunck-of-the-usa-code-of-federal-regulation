####### How must you determine the eligibility of a donor

(d)? You must determine the donor's eligibility before collection of blood or blood components, by the following procedures:

(1) You must consult the records of deferred donors maintained under ยง 606.160(e)(1) and (2) of this chapter. Exception: If pre-collection review of the record described in ยง 606.160(e)(2) of this chapter is not feasible because you cannot consult the cumulative record at the collection site, you must consult the cumulative record prior to release of any blood or blood component prepared from the collection.

(2) Assure that the interval since the donor's last donation is appropriate;

(3) Assess the donor's medical history; and

(4) Perform a physical assessment of the donor.
