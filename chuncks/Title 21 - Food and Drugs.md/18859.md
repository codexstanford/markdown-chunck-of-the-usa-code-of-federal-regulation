####### Used hearing aid.

A hearing aid is "used" if a user has worn it for any period of time. However, a hearing aid shall not be "used" merely because a prospective user wore it as part of a bona fide hearing aid evaluation to determine whether to select that particular hearing aid for that prospective user. A hearing aid evaluation is "bona fide" if it was conducted in the presence of the dispenser or a hearing health professional selected by the dispenser to assist the prospective user in making a determination.
