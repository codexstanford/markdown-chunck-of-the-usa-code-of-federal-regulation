(c)(1) A Foreign Seller must have systems in place to:

(i) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is a suspect foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, or upon receiving a request for verification from FDA that the Foreign Seller has determined that a product within its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, a Foreign Seller must:

(A) Quarantine such product within its possession or control until such product is cleared or dispositioned;

(B) Promptly conduct an investigation, in coordination with the Importer and the manufacturer, as applicable, to determine whether the product is an illegitimate foreign product, and verify the product at the package level, including the SSI; and

(C) If the Foreign Seller makes the determination that a suspect foreign product is not an illegitimate foreign product, promptly notify FDA of such determination for those products that FDA has requested verification.

(ii) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is an illegitimate foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must:

(A) Quarantine such product within the possession or control of the Foreign Seller from product intended for distribution until such product is dispositioned;

(B) Disposition the illegitimate foreign product within the possession or control of the Foreign Seller;

(C) Take reasonable and appropriate steps to assist a manufacturer or Importer to disposition an illegitimate product not in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller; and

(D) Retain a sample of the product for further physical examination or laboratory analysis of the product by the manufacturer or FDA (or other appropriate Federal or State official) upon request by FDA (or other appropriate Federal or State official), as necessary and appropriate.

(2)(i) Upon determining that a product in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must notify FDA and the Importer that the Foreign Seller received such illegitimate product not later than 24 hours after making such determination.

(ii) Upon the receipt of a notification from the manufacturer, FDA, the Importer or other wholesale distributor, or dispenser that a determination has been made that a product that had been sold by the Foreign Seller is an illegitimate foreign product, a Foreign Seller must identify all illegitimate foreign product subject to such notification that is in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller, including any product that is subsequently received, and perform the activities to investigate the product described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(iii) Upon making a determination, in consultation with FDA, that a notification is no longer necessary, a Foreign Seller must promptly notify the Importer and person who sent the notification that the notification is terminated.

(iv) A Foreign Seller must keep records of the disposition of an illegitimate foreign product for not less than 6 years after the conclusion of the disposition.

(3) Upon request by FDA, or other appropriate Federal or State official, in the event of a recall or for purposes of investigating a suspect foreign product or an illegitimate foreign product, a Foreign Seller must promptly provide the official with information about its transactions with the manufacturer and the Importer.

(4) A Foreign Seller, upon receiving a shipment of eligible prescription drugs from the manufacturer, must:

(i) Separate the portion of drugs intended for sale to the Importer located in the United States, and store such portion separately from that portion of product intended for sale in the Canadian market;

(ii) Assign an SSI to each package and homogenous case intended for sale to the Importer in the United States, unless each such package and homogenous case displayed a manufacturer-affixed or imprinted product identifier, as such term is defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, at the time of receipt by the Foreign Seller;

(iii) Affix or imprint the SSI on each package and homogenous case intended for sale to the Importer in the United States. Such SSI must be located on blank space on the package or homogenous case and must not obscure any labeling for the Canadian market, including the DIN; and

(iv) Keep records associating the SSI with the DIN and all the records the Foreign Seller received from the manufacturer upon receipt of the original shipment intended for the Canadian market for not less than 6 years.

(5) Upon receiving a request for verification from the Importer or other authorized repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser that is in possession or control of a product such person believes to be distributed by such Foreign Seller, a Foreign Seller must, not later than 24 hours after receiving the request for verification, or in such other reasonable time as determined by the FDA based on the circumstances of the request, notify the person making the request whether the SSI that is the subject of the request corresponds to the SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller. If a Foreign Seller responding to a request for verification identifies an SSI that does not correspond to that SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller, the Foreign Seller must treat such product as suspect foreign product and conduct an investigation as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the Foreign Seller determines the product is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must advise the person making the request of such determination at the time such Foreign Seller responds to the request for verification.
