####### Identification.

(a)A euthyscope is a device that is a modified AC-powered or battery-powered ophthalmoscope (a perforated mirror device intended to inspect the interior of the eye) that projects a bright light encompassing an arc of about 30 degrees onto the fundus of the eye. The center of the light bundle is blocked by a black disk covering the fovea (the central depression of the macular retinae where only cones are present and blood vessels are lacking). The device is intended for use in the treatment of amblyopia (dimness of vision without apparent disease of the eye).
