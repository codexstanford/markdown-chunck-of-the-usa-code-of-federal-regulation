####### e.g.,

(iv) The dataset must be adequately representative of the intended use population for the device (patients, range of vessel sizes, imaging device models). Any selection criteria or limitations of the samples must be fully described and justified;

(v) Statistical methods must consider the predefined endpoints:

(A) Estimates of probabilities of incorrect results must be provided for each endpoint,

(B) Where multiple samples from the same patient are used, statistical analysis must not assume statistical independence without adequate justification, and

(C) The report must provide appropriate confidence intervals for each performance metric;

(vi) Sensitivity and specificity must be characterized across the range of available measurements;

(vii) Agreement of the simulated measure(s) with clinically acceptable measure(s) must be assessed across the full range of measurements;

(viii) Comparison of the measurement performance must be provided across the range of intended image acquisition hardware; and

(ix) If the device uses a cutoff threshold or operates across a spectrum of disease, it must be established prior to validation, and it must be justified as to how it was determined and clinically validated;
