####### Unexpected adverse event

means an adverse event that is not included in the current U.S. labeling for the drug product. Events that may be symptomatically or pathophysiologically related to an adverse event included in the labeling but differ from the labeled event because of greater severity or specificity would be considered unexpected. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events that are mentioned in the product labeling as occurring with a class of products or anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product.
