###### ยง 1114.15 Supplemental applications.
####### Supplemental PMTA submission.

(a)Applicants that have received a marketing granted order for a tobacco product may, as an alternative format of submitting an application that meets the content requirements of ยง 1114.7, submit a supplemental PMTA to seek marketing authorization for modifications to such product, which result in a new tobacco product under section 910(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Supplemental PMTAs must include new information concerning modifications that create the new tobacco product but allow the applicant to satisfy the remaining application requirements by cross-referencing applicable content from the previously submitted PMTA for the original tobacco product. Applicants may submit supplemental PMTAs only for modifications that require the submission of limited new information or where specified in a rule under section 907 of the FD&C Act. Except as permitted in a rule under section 907 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, an applicant may not submit a supplemental PMTA where:

(1) Modifications to the product that result in the new tobacco product require the submission of new information or revisions to the PMTA for the original product to the extent that reviewing a supplemental application for the new tobacco product would be confusing, cumbersome, or otherwise inefficient and submitting a standard PMTA under ยง 1114.7 would better facilitate review.

(2) The marketing granted order for the original tobacco product has been withdrawn; or

(3) The marketing granted order for the original tobacco product has been temporarily suspended or is subject to temporary suspension or withdrawal proceedings by FDA, except where authorized in writing by FDA.
