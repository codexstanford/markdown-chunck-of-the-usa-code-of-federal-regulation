(a)spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies tospp. in serum. Additionally, some of these reagents consist ofspp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identifyspp. directly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genusand provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms.spp. are associated with inflammatory conditions of the urinary and respiratory tracts, the genitals, and the mouth. The effects in humans of infection withrange from inapparent infection to mild or severe upper respiratory disease, ear infection, and bronchial pneumonia.
