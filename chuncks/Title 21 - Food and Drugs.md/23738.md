###### ยง 886.4392 Nd:YAG laser for posterior capsulotomy and peripheral iridotomy.
####### Identification.

(a)The Nd:YAG laser for posterior capsulotomy and peripheral iridotomy consists of a mode-locked or Q-switched solid state Nd:YAG laser intended for disruption of the posterior capsule or the iris via optical breakdown. The Nd:YAG laser generates short pulse, low energy, high power, coherent optical radiation. When the laser output is combined with focusing optics, the high irradiance at the target causes tissue disruption via optical breakdown. A visible aiming system is utilized to target the invisible Nd:YAG laser radiation on or in close proximity to the target tissue.
