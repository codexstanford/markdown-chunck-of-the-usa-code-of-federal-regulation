###### § 101.62 Nutrient content claims for fat, fatty acid, and cholesterol content of foods.
####### 2

() Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., "Contains no cholesterol compared with 30 mg cholesterol in one serving of butter. Contains 13 g of fat per serving.") is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.

(2) The terms "low in cholesterol," "low cholesterol," "contains a small amount of cholesterol," "low source of cholesterol," or "little cholesterol" may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:

(i) For foods that have a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 g or greater than 2 tablespoons and contain 13 g or less of total fat per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving:

(A) The food contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol per reference amount customarily consumed;

(B) The food contains 2 g or less of saturated fatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed; and

(C) As required in § 101.13(e)(2), if the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches (e.g., "low fat cottage cheese, a low cholesterol food.").

(ii) For foods that have a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less and contain 13 g or less of total fat per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving, and per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form);

(A) The food contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol per reference amount customarily consumed and per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form);

(B) The food contains 2 g or less of saturated fatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed; and

(C) As required in § 101.13(e)(2), if the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches (e.g., "low fat cottage cheese, a low cholesterol food").

(iii) For foods that have a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 g or greater than 2 tablespoons and contain more than 13 g of total fat per reference amount customarily consumed or per labeled serving,

(A) The food contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol per reference amount customarily consumed;

(B) The food contains 2 g or less of saturated fatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed;

(C) The label or labeling discloses the level of total fat in a serving (as declared on the label) of the food. Such disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim preceding any disclosure statement required under § 101.13(h) in type that shall be no less than one-half the size of the type used for such claim. If the claim appears on more than one panel, the disclosure shall be made on each panel except for the panel that bears nutrition labeling. If the claim is made more than once on a panel, the disclosure shall be made in immediate proximity to the claim that is printed in the largest type; and

(D) As required in § 101.13(e)(2), if the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches; or

(E) If the food contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol only as a result of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation, the amount of cholesterol is substantially less (i.e., meets requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section) than the food for which it substitutes as specified in § 101.13(d) that has a significant (e.g., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share. As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:
