(a) Polyphenylene sulfide resins consist of basic resins produced by the reaction of equimolar parts ofdichlorobenzene and sodium sulfide, such that the finished resins meet the following specifications as determined by methods titled "Oxygen Flask Combustion-Gravimetric Method for Determination of Sulfur in Organic Compounds," "Determination of the Inherent Viscosity of Polyphenylene Sulfide," and "Analysis for Dichlorobenzene in Ryton Polyphenylene Sulfide," which are incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-200), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

(1) Sulfur content: 28.2-29.1 percent by weight of finished resin.

(2) Minimum inherent viscosity: 0.13 deciliters per gram.
