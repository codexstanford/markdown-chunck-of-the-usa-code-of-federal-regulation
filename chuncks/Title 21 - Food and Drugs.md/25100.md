###### Test conditions.

(2)Except as provided in ยง 1010.13, tests for compliance with each of the applicable requirements of this section and ยง 1040.11 shall be made during operation, maintenance, or service as appropriate:

(i) Under those conditions and procedures which maximize the accessible emission levels, including start-up, stabilized emission, and shut-down of the laser product; and

(ii) With all controls and adjustments listed in the operation, maintenance, and service instructions adjusted in combination to result in the maximum accessible emission level of radiation; and

(iii) At points in space to which human access is possible in the product configuration which is necessary to determine compliance with each requirement, e.g., if operation may require removal of portions of the protective housing and defeat of safety interlocks, measurements shall be made at points accessible in that product configuration; and

(iv) With the measuring instrument detector so positioned and so oriented with respect to the laser product as to result in the maximum detection of radiation by the instrument; and

(v) For a laser product other than a laser system, with the laser coupled to that type of laser energy source which is specified as compatible by the laser product manufacturer and which produces the maximum emission level of accessible radiation from that product.
