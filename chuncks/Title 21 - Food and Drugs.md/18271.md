(c) Procedures to demonstrate incompatibility between the donor's cell type and the recipient's serum or plasma type.

(d) A provision that, if the unit of donor's blood has not been screened by a method that will demonstrate agglutinating, coating and hemolytic antibodies, the recipient's cells shall be tested with the donor's serum (minor crossmatch) by a method that will so demonstrate.
