() For percent agreements for DD, Dd and dd (PA(DD|DD), PA(Dd|Dd) and PA(dd|dd)) as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J)()() of this section, the 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals must be provided. The accuracy point estimates for percent agreements for DD, Dd and dd must be ≥99 percent per reported variant and overall. Any variants that have a point estimate for either PA(DD|DD), PA(Dd|Dd), or PA(dd|dd) of <99 percent compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. Accuracy results generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. Results must be summarized and presented in tabular format by sample type and by genotype or must be reported using another method identified as appropriate by FDA (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J)()() of this section).
