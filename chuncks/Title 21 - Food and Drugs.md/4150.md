(5)Bleeders, except those for temperature-indicating device wells, shall be-inch (3 millimeters) or larger and shall be wide open during the entire process, including the come-up time. Bleeders shall be located within approximately 1 foot (30.5 centimeters) of the outermost location of containers, at each end along the top of the retort; additional bleeders shall be located not more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) apart along the top. Bleeders may be installed at positions other than those specified in this paragraph, as long as there is evidence in the form of heat distribution data that they accomplish adequate removal of air and circulation of heat within the retort. In retorts having top steam inlet and bottom venting, a bleeder shall be installed in the bottom of the retort to remove condensate. All bleeders shall be arranged in a way that enables the operator to observe that they are functioning properly.
