###### ยง 10.95 Participation in outside standard-setting activities.
####### Standard-setting activities by private groups and organizations.

(d)(1) An FDA employee may engage in these activities after approval of the activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual Guide. A request for official participation must be made by the group or organization in writing, must describe the scope of the activity, and must demonstrate that the minimum standards set out in paragraph (d)(5) of this section are met. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, a request that is granted will be the subject of a letter from the Commissioner or the center director to the organization stating-

(i) Whether participation by the individual will be as a voting or nonvoting liaison representative;

(ii) That participation by the individual does not connote FDA agreement with, or endorsement of, any decisions reached; and

(iii) That participation by the individual precludes service as the deciding official on the standard involved if it should later come before FDA. The deciding official is the person who signs a document ruling upon the standard.
