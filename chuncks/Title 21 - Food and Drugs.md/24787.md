###### Test conditions.

(3)All measurements shall be made with the receiver displaying a usable picture and with the power source operated at supply voltages up to the maximum test voltage of the receiver and, as applicable, under the following specific conditions:

(i) On television receivers manufactured subsequent to January 15, 1970, measurements shall be made with all user controls adjusted so as to produce maximum x-radiation emissions from the receiver.

(ii) On television receivers manufactured subsequent to June 1, 1970, measurements shall be made with all user controls and all service controls adjusted to combinations which result in the production of maximum x-radiation emissions.

(iii) On television receivers manufactured subsequent to June 1, 1971, measurements shall be made under the conditions described in paragraph (c)(3) (ii) of this section, together with conditions identical to those which result from that component or circuit failure which maximizes x-radiation emissions.
