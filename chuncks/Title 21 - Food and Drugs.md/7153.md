(ii)A preweighed sample is extracted at 50 &#xB0;C for 2 hours and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated and the total residue weighed as a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. Alternatively, the sample is reweighed after the extraction period to give a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. The maximum-hexane-extractable fraction may be determined by the methods set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)() through (d)(3)(ii)() of this section.
