(1) A summary of the product formulation section of the application;

(2) A summary of the manufacturing section of the application;

(3) A summary of the health risk investigations section of the application, including all information regarding the following items, and identify areas in which there is a lack of information, where applicable:

(ii) The impact the product and its marketing will have on the likelihood of changes in tobacco use behavior, including cessation, switching, and polyuse, of tobacco product users;

(iii) The impact the product and its marketing will have on the likelihood of tobacco use initiation by tobacco product nonusers;

(iv) How users and nonusers perceive the risk of the tobacco product based upon its label, labeling, and advertising, to the extent that advertising has been studied;

(v) Whether users are able to understand the labeling and instructions for use, and use the product in accordance with those instructions; and

(vi) The impact of human factors on the health risks to product users and nonusers (as described in paragraph (k)(1)(v) of this section);

(4) A concluding discussion describing how the data and information contained in the PMTA both constitute valid scientific evidence and establish that permitting marketing of the new tobacco product is appropriate for the protection of the public health, as determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product. This discussion must specifically describe the effects on youth, young adults, and other relevant vulnerable populations with an emphasis on populations that are most likely to use the new tobacco product. The summary must also identify any key or pivotal studies on which an applicant is relying to establish that permitting the marketing of the new tobacco product would be APPH.
