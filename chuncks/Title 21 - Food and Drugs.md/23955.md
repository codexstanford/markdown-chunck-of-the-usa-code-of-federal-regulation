####### Identification.

(a)A knee joint patellofemoral polymer/metal semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint in the treatment of primary patellofemoral arthritis or chondromalacia. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes a component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum or austenitic steel, for resurfacing the intercondylar groove (femoral sulcus) on the anterior aspect of the distal femur, and a patellar component made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. This generic type of device is limited to those devices intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027). The patellar component is designed to be implanted only with its femoral component.
