(4) Ultraviolet absorbance limits as follows, as determined by the analytical method described in this subparagraph:

Ultraviolet absorbance per centimeter pathlength.

(b) The polyhydric alcohol esters identified in this paragraph may be used as release agents in resinous and polymeric coatings for polyolefin films complying with ยง 175.320 of this chapter. Such esters meet the following specifications and are produced by partial esterification of oxidatively refined (Gersthofen process) montan wax acids with equimolar proportions of ethylene glycol and 1,3-butanediol:

(1) Dropping point 77&#xB0;-82 &#xB0;C, as determined by ASTM method D566-76 (Reapproved 1982), "Standard Test Method for Dropping Point of Lubricating Grease," which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
