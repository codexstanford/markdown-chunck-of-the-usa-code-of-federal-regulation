####### Identity.

(a)(1) The color additive D&C Red No. 6 is principally the disodium salt of 3-hydroxy-4-[(4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CAS Reg. No. 5858-81-1). To manufacture the additive, 2-amino-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid is diazotized with hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite. The diazo compound is coupled in alkaline medium with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid. The resulting dye precipitates as the disodium salt.

(2) Color additive mixtures for drug use made with D&C Red No. 6 may contain only those diluents that are suitable and that are listed in part 73 of this chapter as safe for use in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs.
