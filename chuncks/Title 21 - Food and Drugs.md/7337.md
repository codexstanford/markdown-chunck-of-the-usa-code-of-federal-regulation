(i) Total extractives do not exceed 0.10 weight-percent when extracted withheptane at 150 &#xB0;F for 2 hours.

(ii) Total extractives do not exceed 0.03 weight-percent when extracted with water at 150 &#xB0;F for 2 hours.

(iii) Total extractives obtained by extracting with water at 150 &#xB0;F for 2 hours contain no more than 0.5 milligram of vinyl chloride-ethylene copol-ymer per 100 grams of sample tested as determined from the organic chlorine content. The organic chlorine content is determined as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(d) Analytical methods: The analytical methods for determining whether vinyl chloride-ethylene basic copolymers conform to the extractives limitations prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section are as follows and are applicable to the basic copolymers in powder form having a particle size such that 100 percent will pass through a U.S. Standard Sieve No. 40 and 80 percent will pass through a U.S. Standard Sieve No. 80:
