####### Identification.

(a)A tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin is a device indicated for topical application only to hold closed easily approximated skin edges of wounds from surgical incisions, including punctures from minimally invasive surgery, and simple, thoroughly cleansed, trauma-induced lacerations. It may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of, deep dermal stitches. Additionally, the adjunct wound closure device component maintains temporary skin edge alignment along the length of wound during application of the liquid adhesive.
