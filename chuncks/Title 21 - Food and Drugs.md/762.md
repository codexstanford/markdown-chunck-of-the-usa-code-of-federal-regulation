(c)This subpart does not apply to food produced and packaged on a farm, provided that:

(1) The packaging of the food remains in place until the food reaches the consumer, and such packaging maintains the integrity of the product and prevents subsequent contamination or alteration of the product; and

(2) The labeling of the food that reaches the consumer includes the name, complete address (street address, town, State, country, and zip or other postal code for a domestic farm and comparable information for a foreign farm), and business phone number of the farm on which the food was produced and packaged. FDA will waive the requirement to include a business phone number, as appropriate, to accommodate a religious belief of the individual in charge of the farm.
