####### a

(2) Not less than 50 weight-percent of polymer units derived from the vinyl chloride polymers identified in the introduction to this section, not more than 50 weight-percent of polymer units derived from homopolymers and/or copolymers of ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, and not more than 30 weight-percent of polymer units derived from copolymers of methyl methacrylate,-methylstyrene and acrylonitrile and may optionally contain up to 15 weight-percent of polymer units derived from butadiene-styrene copolymers.

(c) No chemical reactions, other than addition reactions, occur among the vinyl chloride polymers and the modifying polymers present in the polymer mixture used in the manufacture of the finished plastic food-contact article.

(d) The finished plastic food-contact article, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of § 176.170(c) of this chapter, yields extractives not to exceed the limits prescribed in § 177.1010 (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this chapter when tested by the methods prescribed in § 177.1010 (c) of this chapter.

(e) Acrylonitrile copolymers identified in this section shall comply with the provisions of § 180.22 of this chapter.
