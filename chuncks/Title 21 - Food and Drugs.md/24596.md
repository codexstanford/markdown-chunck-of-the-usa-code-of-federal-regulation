(ii) The technique factors (peak tube potential in kilovolt (kV) and either tube current in mA and exposure time in seconds or the product of tube current and exposure time in mAs) to be used during an exposure shall be indicated before the exposure begins, except when automatic exposure controls (AEC) are used, in which case the technique factors that are set prior to the exposure shall be indicated.

(iii) Following AEC mode use, the system shall indicate the actual kilovoltage peak (kVp) and mAs used during the exposure. The mAs may be displayed as mA and time.
