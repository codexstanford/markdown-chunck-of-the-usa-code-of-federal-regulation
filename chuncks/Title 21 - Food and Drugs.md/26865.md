ONDCP will assess a fee to process FOIA requests in accordance with the provisions of this section and Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB Guidelines"). ONDCP shall ensure that searches, review and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. ONDCP will ordinarily collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. ONDCP will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under ยง 1401.15, or the total fee to be charged is less than $25.00. ONDCP will notify you if we estimate that charges will exceed $25.00 including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication and whether applicable entitlements to duplication and search at no charge have been provided. ONDCP will not process your request until you either commit in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designate some amount of fees you are willing to pay.
