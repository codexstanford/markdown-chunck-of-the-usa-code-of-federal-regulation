(1) The film when extracted with distilled water at 21 &#xB0;C (70 &#xB0;F) for 48 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.0047 milligram per square centimeter (0.03 milligram per square inch) of food-contact surface.

(2) The film when extracted with 50 percent ethyl alcohol at 21 &#xB0;C (70 &#xB0;F) for 48 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.0062 milligram per square centimeter (0.04 milligram per square inch) of food-contact surface.
