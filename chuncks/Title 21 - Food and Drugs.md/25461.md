####### FDA review of postmarket reports.

(b)(1) As part of its review of a postmarket report, FDA may require the applicant to submit additional information to enable it to determine whether a change results in a new tobacco product, or to facilitate a determination of whether there are or may be grounds to withdraw or temporarily suspend the marketing granted order.

(2) FDA may notify an applicant that FDA has determined that a change described in a periodic report made under this section results in a new tobacco product outside the scope of the marketing granted order, requiring the submission of a new PMTA under ยง 1114.7 or a supplemental PMTA under ยง 1114.15 and issuance of a marketing granted order if the applicant seeks to market the new tobacco product, unless the new tobacco product can be legally marketed through a different premarket pathway.
