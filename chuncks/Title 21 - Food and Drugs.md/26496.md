##### alpha

(2) Any person who manufactures, distributes, imports, or exports a chemical mixture containing regulated forms of methyl-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA; methyl 3-oxo-2-phenylbutanoate) and its optical isomers whose application for exemption is subsequently denied by DEA must obtain a registration with DEA. A temporary exemption from the registration requirement would also be provided for those persons whose application for exemption is denied, provided that DEA receives a properly completed application for registration on or before 30 days following the date of official DEA notification that the application for exemption has been denied. The temporary exemption for such persons would remain in effect until DEA takes final action on their registration application.
