####### Identification.

(a)A device to detect and identify microorganisms and associated resistance marker nucleic acids directly from respiratory specimens is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the detection and identification of microorganisms and associated resistance markers in respiratory specimens collected from patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory infection. The device is intended to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and other laboratory findings. These devices do not provide confirmation of antibiotic susceptibility since mechanisms of resistance may exist other than those detected by the device.
