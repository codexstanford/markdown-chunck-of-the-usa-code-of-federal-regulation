####### Process pH determination.

(7)Obtain sample portions of material for pH determination.

(i) For process liquids, adjust the temperature of the liquid to 25 &#xB0;C and determine the pH by immersing the electrodes in the liquid.

(ii) Drain solid materials on a sieve and blend to a workable paste. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 &#xB0;C and determine its pH.

(iii) If enough solid materials are available to make a paste, blend representative aliquots of liquid and solid materials to a workable paste. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 &#xB0;C and determine the equilibrated pH. Alternatively, blend the entire contents of the container to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25 &#xB0;C, and determine the equilibrated pH.
