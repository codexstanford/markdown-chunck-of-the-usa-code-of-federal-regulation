####### Equipment and procedures for pressure processing in water in still retorts,Temperature-indicating device.

(b)-(1)Each retort shall be equipped with at least one temperature-indicating device that accurately indicates the temperature during processing. Each temperature-indicating device shall have a sensor and a display. Each temperature-indicating device and each reference device that is maintained by the processor shall be tested for accuracy against a reference device for which the accuracy is traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or other national metrology institute, standard reference device by appropriate standard procedures, upon installation and at least once a year thereafter, or more frequently if necessary, to ensure accuracy during processing. Each temperature-indicating device and each reference device that is maintained by the processor shall have a tag, seal, or other means of identity.

(i) The design of the temperature-indicating device shall ensure that the accuracy of the device is not affected by electromagnetic interference and environmental conditions.

(ii) Records of the accuracy of the temperature-indicating device and of a reference device that is maintained by the processor shall be established and maintained in accordance with ยง 113.100(c) and (d).

(iii) A temperature-indicating device that is defective or cannot be adjusted to the accurate calibrated reference device shall be repaired before further use or replaced.

(iv) A temperature-indicating device shall be accurate to 1 &#xB0;F (0.5 &#xB0;C). The temperature range of a mercury-in-glass thermometer shall not exceed 17 &#xB0;F per inch (4 &#xB0;C per centimeter) of graduated scale. A mercury-in-glass thermometer that has a divided mercury column shall be considered defective.

(v) Each temperature-indicating device shall be installed where it can be accurately and easily read. In both horizontal and vertical retorts, the temperature-indicating device sensor shall be inserted directly into the retort shell or in a separate well or sleeve attached to the retort. The temperature-indicating device sensor shall be located so that it is beneath the surface of the water throughout the process and where there is adequate circulation to ensure accurate temperature measurement. On horizontal retorts, the temperature-indicating device sensor should be located in the side at the center of the retort. The temperature-indicating device-not the temperature-recording device-shall be the reference instrument for indicating the processing temperature.
