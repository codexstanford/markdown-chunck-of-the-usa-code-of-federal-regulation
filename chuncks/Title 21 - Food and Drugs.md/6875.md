####### Heptane,120 &#xB0;F for 30 minutes,simulating frozen fatty foods reheated in the container.

(xiv)(),Preheat redistilled reagent-grade heptane (boiling point 208 &#xB0;F) carefully in a clean Pyrex flask on a water bath or hot plate in a well-ventilated hood to 120 &#xB0;F. At the same time, preheat a pressure cooker to 120 &#xB0;F in an incubator. This pressure cooker is to serve only as a container for the heptane-containing test package inside the incubator in order to minimize the danger of explosion. Fill the test container within-inch of the top with a measured volume of the 120 &#xB0;F heptane and cover with clean aluminum foil. Place the test container in the preheated pressure cooker and then put the assembly into a 120 &#xB0;F incubator. After 30 minutes, remove the pressure cooker from the incubator, open the assembly and immediately composite the heptane from each replicate into a clean Pyrex flask. Proceed with the determination of the amount of extractives by the method described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
