####### Identification.

(a)An electrohydraulic lithotriptor is an AC-powered device used to fragment urinary bladder stones. It consists of a high voltage source connected by a cable to a bipolar electrode that is introduced into the urinary bladder through a cystoscope. The electrode is held against the stone in a water-filled bladder and repeated electrical discharges between the two poles of the electrode cause electrohydraulic shock waves which disintegrate the stone.
