###### Advertisements that may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.

(7)An advertisement may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act if it:

(i) Contains favorable information or conclusions from a study that is inadequate in design, scope, or conduct to furnish significant support for such information or conclusions.

(ii) Uses the concept of "statistical significance" to support a claim that has not been demonstrated to have clinical significance or validity, or fails to reveal the range of variations around the quoted average results.

(iii) Uses statistical analyses and techniques on a retrospective basis to discover and cite findings not soundly supported by the study, or to suggest scientific validity and rigor for data from studies the design or protocol of which are not amenable to formal statistical evaluations.

(iv) Uses tables or graphs to distort or misrepresent the relationships, trends, differences, or changes among the variables or products studied; for example, by failing to label abscissa and ordinate so that the graph creates a misleading impression.

(v) Uses reports or statements represented to be statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations that are inconsistent with or violate the established principles of statistical theory, methodology, applied practice, and inference, or that are derived from clinical studies the design, data, or conduct of which substantially invalidate the application of statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations.

(vi) Contains claims concerning the mechanism or site of drug action that are not generally regarded as established by scientific evidence by experts qualified by scientific training and experience without disclosing that the claims are not established and the limitations of the supporting evidence.

(vii) Fails to provide sufficient emphasis for the information relating to side effects and contraindications, when such information is contained in a distinct part of an advertisement, because of repetition or other emphasis in that part of the advertisement of claims for effectiveness or safety of the drug.

(viii) Fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug, taking into account all implementing factors such as typography, layout, contrast, headlines, paragraphing, white space, and any other techniques apt to achieve emphasis.

(ix) Fails to provide adequate emphasis (for example, by the use of color scheme, borders, headlines, or copy that extends across the gutter) for the fact that two facing pages are part of the same advertisement when one page contains information relating to side effects and contraindications.

(x) In an advertisement promoting use of the drug in a selected class of patients (for example, geriatric patients or depressed patients), fails to present with adequate emphasis the significant side effects and contraindications or the significant dosage considerations, when dosage recommendations are included in an advertisement, especially applicable to that selected class of patients.

(xi) Fails to present on a page facing another page (or on another full page) of an advertisement on more than one page, information relating to side effects and contraindications when such information is in a distinct part of the advertisement.

(xii) Fails to include on each page or spread of an advertisement the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location when it is presented as a distinct part of an advertisement.

(xiii) Contains information from published or unpublished reports or opinions falsely or misleadingly represented or suggested to be authentic or authoritative.

(f)-(i) [Reserved]

(j)(1) No advertisement concerning a particular prescription drug may be disseminated without prior approval by the Food and Drug Administration if:

(i) The sponsor or the Food and Drug Administration has received information that has not been widely publicized in medical literature that the use of the drug may cause fatalities or serious damage;

(ii) The Commissioner (or in his absence the officer acting as Commissioner), after evaluating the reliability of such information, has notified the sponsor that the information must be a part of the advertisements for the drug; and

(iii) The sponsor has failed within a reasonable time as specified in such notification to present to the Food and Drug Administration a program, adequate in light of the nature of the information, for assuring that such information will be publicized promptly and adequately to the medical profession in subsequent advertisements.

(2) Within a reasonable time after information concerning the possibility that a drug may cause fatalities or serious damage has been widely publicized in medical literature, the Food and Drug Administration shall notify the sponsor of the drug by mail that prior approval of advertisements for the drug is no longer necessary.

(3) Dissemination of an advertisement not in compliance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act that causes the drug to be misbranded under section 502(n) of the act.

(4) Any advertisement may be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration prior to publication for comment. If the advertiser is notified that the submitted advertisement is not in violation and, at some subsequent time, the Food and Drug Administration changes its opinion, the advertiser will be so notified and will be given a reasonable time for correction before any regulatory action is taken under this section. Notification to the advertiser that a proposed advertisement is or is not considered to be in violation shall be in written form.

(5) The sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter with respect to any determination that prior approval is required for advertisements concerning a particular prescription drug, or that a particular advertisement is not approvable.

(k) An advertisement issued or caused to be issued by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug promoted by the advertisement and which is not in compliance with section 502(n) of the act and the applicable regulations thereunder shall cause stocks of such drug in possession of the person responsible for issuing or causing the issuance of the advertisement, and stocks of the drug distributed by such person and still in the channels of commerce, to be misbranded under section 502(n) of the act.

(l)(1) Advertisements subject to section 502(n) of the act include advertisements in published journals, magazines, other periodicals, and newspapers, and advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, and telephone communication systems.

(2) Brochures, booklets, mailing pieces, detailing pieces, file cards, bulletins, calendars, price lists, catalogs, house organs, letters, motion picture films, film strips, lantern slides, sound recordings, exhibits, literature, and reprints and similar pieces of printed, audio, or visual matter descriptive of a drug and references published (for example, the "Physicians Desk Reference") for use by medical practitioners, pharmacists, or nurses, containing drug information supplied by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug and which are disseminated by or on behalf of its manufacturer, packer, or distributor are hereby determined to be labeling as defined in section 201(m) of the act.
