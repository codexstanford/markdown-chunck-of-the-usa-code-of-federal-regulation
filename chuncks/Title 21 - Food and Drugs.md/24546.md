(2) If FDA determines that the new application demonstrates that the body satisfactorily has addressed the causes of its previous unacceptable performance, FDA may reinstate approval of the accreditation body.

(3) FDA may request additional information or establish additional conditions that must be met by a former accreditation body before FDA approves the reapplication.
