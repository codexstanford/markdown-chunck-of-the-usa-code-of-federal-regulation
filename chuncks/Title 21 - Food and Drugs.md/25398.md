####### Shelf life and stability information.

(vii)With the exception of applications for roll-your-own tobacco products and cigarettes that are not HTPs, the application must contain information on the stability of the tobacco product over the shelf life and including the following:

(A) The length of the shelf life, a description of how the shelf life is determined, and a description of how shelf life is indicated on the tobacco product, if applicable;

(B) Stability data assessed at the beginning (zero time), middle, and end of the expected shelf life. If a tobacco product does not have a defined shelf life, provide stability data over a specified amount of time and a justification for why that time period is appropriate. Stability testing must be performed for the microbial and chemical endpoints as follows: Microbial content data, including total aerobic microbial count and total yeast and mold count; water activity; tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) yields (total TSNAs, N&#x2032;-nitrosonor-nicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK)); and preservatives content.

(C) Stability testing details for each microbial and chemical endpoint, including: The mean quantity and variance with unit of measures; the number of samples and measurement replicates for each sample; the methods used, including any deviation(s) from the methods, associated reference(s), and full validations reports for each method; the testing laboratory or laboratories and documentation showing that the laboratory or laboratories is (or are) accredited by a nationally or internationally recognized external accreditation organization; length of time between date of tobacco product manufacture and date(s) of testing; storage conditions of the tobacco product before it was tested; a statement that the testing was performed on a tobacco product in the same container closure system in which the tobacco product is intended to be marketed; and full test data (including quantitative acceptance (pass/fail) criteria, complete data sets, and a summary for the results) for all stability testing performed.
