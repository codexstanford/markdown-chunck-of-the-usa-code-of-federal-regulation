###### ยง 201.315 Over-the-counter drugs for minor sore throats; suggested warning.

The Food and Drug Administration has studied the problem of the labeling of lozenges or troches containing a local anesthetic, chewing gum containing aspirin, various mouth washes and gargles and other articles sold over the counter for the relief of minor irritations of the mouth or throat. It will not object to the labeling of suitable articles of this type "For the temporary relief of minor sore throats", provided this is immediately followed in the labeling with a warning statement in prominent type essentially as follows: "Warning-Severe or persistent sore throat or sore throat accompanied by high fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting may be serious. Consult physician promptly. Do not use more than 2 days or administer to children under 3 years of age unless directed by physician."
