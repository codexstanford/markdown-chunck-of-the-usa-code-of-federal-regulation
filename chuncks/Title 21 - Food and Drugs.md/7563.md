(iii) Subsequent determinations for the dodecyltin mixture described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section shall be at a minimum of 24-hour intervals for aqueous solvents and 2-hour intervals for heptane. These tests shall yield di(-octyl)tin S,S&#x2032;-bis(isooctylmercaptoacetate), or di(-octyl)tin maleate polymer, or (C-C)-alkylmercaptoacetate reaction products with dichlorodioctylstannane and trichlorooctylstannane, or-octyltin S,S&#x2032;,S&#x2033;-tris(isooctylmercaptoacetate), tris(isooctylmercaptoacetate) and di(-dodecyl)tin bis(isooctylmercaptoacetate) or any combination thereof, not to exceed 0.5 parts per million as determined by an analytical method entitled "Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric Determination of Sub-part-per-Million Quantities of Tin in Extracts and Biological Materials with Graphite Furnace,"Vol. 49, pp. 1090-1093 (1977), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(2) In lieu of the tests prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the finished plastics intended for contact with foods only of Types II, V, VI-A (except malt beverages), and VI-C may be end-tested with food-simulating solvents, under conditions of time and temperature, as specified below, whereby such tests shall yield the octyltin residues cited in paragraph (b)(1) of this section not in excess of 0.5 ppm:
