###### ยง 888.3565 Knee joint patellofemorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis.
####### Identification.

(a)A knee joint patellofemorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace a knee joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device is designed to achieve biological fixation to bone without the use of bone cement. This identification includes fixed-bearing knee prostheses where the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene tibial bearing is rigidly secured to the metal tibial base plate.
