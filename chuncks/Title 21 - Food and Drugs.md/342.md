###### ยง 1.504 What hazard analysis must I conduct?
####### Hazards in raw agricultural commodities that are fruits or vegetables.

(e)If you are importing a raw agricultural commodity that is a fruit or vegetable that is "covered produce" as defined in ยง 112.3 of this chapter, you are not required to determine whether there are any biological hazards requiring a control in such food because the biological hazards in such fruits or vegetables require a control and compliance with the requirements in part 112 of this chapter significantly minimizes or prevents the biological hazards. However, you must determine whether there are any other types of hazards requiring a control in such food.
