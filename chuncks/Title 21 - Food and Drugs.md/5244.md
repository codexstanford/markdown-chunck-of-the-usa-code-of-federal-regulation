###### ยง 137.211 White corn flour.

(a) White corn flour is the food prepared by so grinding and bolting cleaned white corn that when tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, not less than 98 percent passes through a No. 50 sieve and not less than 50 percent passes through No. 70 woven-wire cloth. Its moisture content is not more than 15 percent. In its preparation, part of the ground corn may be removed, but in any such case, the content (on a moisture-free basis) of neither the crude fiber nor fat in the finished white corn flour exceeds the content (on a moisture-free basis) of such substance in the cleaned corn from which it was ground.

(b)(1) For the purpose of this section, moisture, fat, and crude fiber are determined by methods therefore referred to in ยง 137.250(b)(1).
