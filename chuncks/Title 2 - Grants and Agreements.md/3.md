## Subtitle A - Office of Management and Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements
### PART 1 - ABOUT TITLE 2 OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SUBTITLE A
#### Subpart B - Introduction to Subtitle A
##### ยง 1.200 Purpose of chapters I and II.

(a) Chapters I and II of subtitle A provide OMB guidance to Federal agencies that helps ensure consistent and uniform government-wide policies and procedures for management of the agencies' grants and agreements.

(b) There are two chapters for publication of the guidance because portions of it may be revised as a result of ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify requirements for the award and administration of grants and other financial assistance (and thereby implement the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106-107).

(c) The OMB guidance in its initial form-before completion of revisions described in paragraph (b) of this section-is published in chapter II of this subtitle. When revisions to a part of the guidance are finalized, that part is published in chapter I and removed from chapter II.
