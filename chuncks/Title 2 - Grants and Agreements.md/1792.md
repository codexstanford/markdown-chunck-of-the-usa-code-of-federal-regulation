####### Withholding of payments.

5.We will withhold payments for allowable costs under the award at any time during the period of performance only if one or more of the following applies:

a. We suspend either payments or the award, or disallow otherwise allowable costs, as a remedy under OAR Article III due to your material failure to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of this award. If we suspend payments and not the award, we will release withheld payments upon your subsequent compliance. If we suspend the award, then amounts of payments are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of OAR Article III.

b. You are delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, "Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables," in which case we may, after reasonable notice, inform you that we will not make any further payments for costs you incurred after a specified date until you correct the conditions or liquidate the indebtedness to the Federal Government.

c. The award-specific terms and conditions of this award include additional requirements that provide for withholding of payments based on conditions identified during our pre-award risk evaluation, in which case you should have been notified about the nature of those conditions and the actions needed to remove the additional requirements.
