######## Title.

(a)Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity.

Title must vest in the non-Federal entity subject to the following conditions:

(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.

(2) Not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section.
