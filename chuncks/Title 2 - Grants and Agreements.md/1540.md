(6) The obligation date (the date of the grants officer's signature) and, if different, the effective date.

(7) The start date and current end date of the period of performance.

(8) The statutory authority or authorities under which the award or modification was made.

(9) The number and title of the program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under which the award or modification was made.

(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):

(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or "cluster") of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).
