######## Deduction alternative.

(2)A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:

(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: "1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award."

(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: "If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts."
