######## General.

(1)Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:

(i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic status reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real property). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which provides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real property.
