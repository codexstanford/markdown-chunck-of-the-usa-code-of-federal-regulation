######## Research awards.,i.e.,

(2)(i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property (equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research-without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate-if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.

(ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:

(A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.

(B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.

(C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.
