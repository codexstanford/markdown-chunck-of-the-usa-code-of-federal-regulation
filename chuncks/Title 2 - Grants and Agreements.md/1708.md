####### ยง 1128.415 Prior approvals for non-construction activities.
######## Transfers of funds and subawards.

(f)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:

(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).

(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).

(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.
