## Subtitle A - Office of Management and Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements
### PART 1 - ABOUT TITLE 2 OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SUBTITLE A
#### Subpart A - Introduction to Title 2 of the CFR
##### ยง 1.105 Organization and subtitle content.

(a) This title is organized into two subtitles.

(b) The OMB guidance described in ยง 1.100(a) is published in subtitle A. Publication of the OMB guidance in the CFR does not change its nature-it is guidance and not regulation.

(c) Each Federal agency that publishes regulations implementing the OMB guidance has a chapter in subtitle B in which it issues those regulations. The Federal agency regulations in subtitle B differ in nature from the OMB guidance in subtitle A because the OMB guidance is not regulatory (Federal agency regulations in subtitle B may give regulatory effect to the OMB guidance, to the extent that the agency regulations require compliance with all or portions of the guidance).
