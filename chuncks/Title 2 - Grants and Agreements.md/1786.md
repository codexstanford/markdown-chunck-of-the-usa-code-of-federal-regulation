1.

a. Minimize the time between your receipt of a payment under this award and your disbursement of those funds for program purposes.

b. Limit the amount of each advance payment request to the minimum amount you need to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the program or project.

c. Submit each advance payment request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for program purposes, so that your receipt of the funds will be as close in time as is administratively feasible to your actual cash outlay for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
