####### ยง 1128.710 What program income includes.
######## Exceptions.

(2)If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:

(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

(ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.
