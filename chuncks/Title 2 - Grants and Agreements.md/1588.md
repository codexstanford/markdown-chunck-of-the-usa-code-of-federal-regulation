######## Authority to use alternate wording.

(c)(1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

(2) A DoD Component in that case:

(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.

(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.
