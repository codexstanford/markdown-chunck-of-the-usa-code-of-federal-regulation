######## e.g.,

(ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments (through unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between financial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve paragraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.
