##### ยง 416.1 Special Procurement Provisions.

(a) In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, a prospective contractor that develops or drafts specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, request for proposals, contract term and conditions or other documents for use by a State in conducting a procurement under the USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Such prospective contractors are ineligible for contract awards resulting from such procurements regardless of the procurement method used. However, prospective contractors may provide States with specification information related to a State procurement under the USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) and still compete for the procurement if the State, and not the prospective contractor, develops or drafts the specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bid, and/or requests for proposals used to conduct the procurement.

(b) Procurements by States under USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) shall be conducted in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographic preferences except as provided for in 2 CFR 200.319(c).
