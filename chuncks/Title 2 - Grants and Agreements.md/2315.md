####### Section G. Indirect cost rate.

With respect to the requirement in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(xiii) for the subaward to include the "Indirect cost rate for the Federal award:"

1. This requirement applies to cost-type subawards only.

2. The rate the subaward must include is the subrecipient's rate, whether it is a rate set by negotiation with a Federal agency or you or is the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f).

3. You are required to include the indirect cost rate only if the subrecipient is willing to share that information with you and assents that information about its rate is not proprietary. If a subrecipient is not willing to share information about its indirect cost rate with you, consult the grants officer for this award to explore alternative ways to assess the reasonableness of costs of the subaward.
