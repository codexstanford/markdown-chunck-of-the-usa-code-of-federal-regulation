##### Subpart B - General Provisions
###### § 200.101 Applicability.
####### Federal award of cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR to a non-Federal entity.

(c)When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract, but the requirements of subparts D, E, and F are supplementary to the FAR and the contract. When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part, including subpart F of this part, which are supplementary to the CAS requirements. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR 48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603 are always unallowable. For requirements other than those covered in subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part, the terms of the contract and the FAR apply. Note that when a non-Federal entity is awarded a FAR contract, the FAR applies, and the terms and conditions of the contract shall prevail over the requirements of this part.
