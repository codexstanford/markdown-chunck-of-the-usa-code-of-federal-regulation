####### ยง 1134.120 Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.
######## Reporting frequency.

(1)DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.
