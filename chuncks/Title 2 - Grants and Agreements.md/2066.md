######## e.g.,

(i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).

(ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.

(iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules-which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards-the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.
