###### Subpart A - Performance Management, Monitoring, and Reporting (REP Article I)
####### ยง 1134.125 Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.
######## Exception.

(ii)A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.
