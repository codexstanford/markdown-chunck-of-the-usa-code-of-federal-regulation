######## Requirements.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require each recipient to meet minimum bonding requirements if it awards any construction or facility improvement contract with a value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. A recipient would instead use its own bonding requirements if the DoD Component determined that the recipient's bonding policy and requirements are adequate to protect Federal interests.
