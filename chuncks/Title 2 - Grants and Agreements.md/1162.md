No case-by-case exceptions may be granted to the provisions of Subpart F-Audit Requirements of this Part.

(b) USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, is also authorized to approve exceptions, on a class or an individual case basis, to USAID program specific assistance regulations other than those which implement statutory and executive order requirements.
