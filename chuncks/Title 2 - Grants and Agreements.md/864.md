Required cost sharing may be a certain percentage or amount, or may be in the form of contributions of specified items or activities (provision of equipment). It is important that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of cost (in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing. Cost sharing as an eligibility criterion includes requirements based in statute or regulation, as described in ยง 200.306 of this Part. This section should refer to the appropriate portion(s) of section D. stating any pre-award requirements for submission of letters or other documentation to verify commitments to meet cost-sharing requirements if a Federal award is made.
