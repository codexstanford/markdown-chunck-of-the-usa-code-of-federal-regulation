###### Appendix I to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article IX, "National Policy Requirements for Subawards"

Unless modified as provided in ยง 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article IX, as specified in ยง 1138.905, or may modify the wording of the article, consistent with the Component's treatment of NP Articles I through IV in those terms and conditions.

1. You must include provisions in the terms and conditions of each subaward you make, whether cost-type or fixed-amount type, to require the subrecipient entity's compliance with each of the national policy requirements in Sections B through E of this article that you determine is applicable, given the type of entity receiving the subaward and activities it will be carrying out under the subaward.

2. If an entity to which you are about to make a subaward will not accept an award provision requiring its compliance with a national policy requirement that you determine to be applicable, you must alert the award administration office immediately. You may not omit an applicable national policy requirement in order to make the subaward.

3. If at any time during the performance of a subaward, you learn that-or receive a credible allegation that-the subrecipient is not complying with an applicable national policy requirement, you must alert the award administration office immediately.
