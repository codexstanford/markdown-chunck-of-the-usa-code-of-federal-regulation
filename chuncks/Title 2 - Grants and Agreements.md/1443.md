######## Examples.

(b)(1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:

(i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);

(ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;

(iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and

(iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.

(2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term "State" is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.
