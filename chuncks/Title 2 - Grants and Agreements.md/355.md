#### PART 183 - NEVER CONTRACT WITH THE ENEMY
##### ยง 183.30 Access to records.

In addition to any other existing examination-of-records authority, the Federal Government is authorized to examine any records of the recipient and its subawards, to the extent necessary, to ensure that funds, including supplies and services, received under a covered grant or cooperative agreement (see ยง 183.35) are not provided directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity in accordance with Never Contract with the Enemy. The Federal awarding agency may only exercise this authority upon a written determination by the Federal awarding agency that relies on a finding by the commander of a covered combatant command that there is reason to believe that funds, including supplies and services, received under the grant or cooperative agreement may have been provided directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity.
