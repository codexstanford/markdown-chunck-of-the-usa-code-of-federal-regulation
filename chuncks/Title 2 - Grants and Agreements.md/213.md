You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways:

(a) You as a Federal agency official must check SAM Exclusions when you take any action listed in ยง 180.425.

(b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as required by ยง 180.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.
