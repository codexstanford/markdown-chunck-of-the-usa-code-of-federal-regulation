This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 182, as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for implementing the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701-707, as amended, hereafter referred to as "the Act") that applies to grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance. Further, it supplements the OMB guidance with NASA-specific regulation.
