###### Appendix D to Part 1130 - Terms and Conditions for PROP Article IV, "Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies"
####### Section A. Property subject to this article.

This article specifies requirements for use and disposition of equipment and supplies. If a provision of PROP Article I identifies any type of equipment or supplies as exempt property, requirements of this Article apply to that exempt property only to the extent specified in that provision of PROP Article I or an award-specific term or condition. The types of non-exempt property to which this article applies are:

1. Supplies that you acquire either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching under this award; and

2. Equipment for which title is vested conditionally in you. That includes equipment with a conditional title resulting from your having, either under this award or under a previous award from which you transferred accountability for the equipment to this award:

a. Directly charged as project costs, in whole or in part, the acquisition (by purchase, construction or fabrication, or development) of equipment;

b. Donated the equipment to the project or program by counting the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records or the fair market value toward any cost sharing or matching requirements under the award, rather than charging depreciation (see PROP Article I, Section D); or

c. Directly charged as project costs improvements to the equipment that meet the criteria given in paragraph E.1 of PROP Article I.
