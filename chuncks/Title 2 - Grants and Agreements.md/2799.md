###### ยง 2900.3 Questioned cost.

In the DOL, in addition to the guidance contained in 2 CFR 200.1, a questioned cost means a cost that is questioned by an auditor, Federal Project Officer, Grant Officer, or other authorized Awarding agency representative because of an audit or monitoring finding:

(a) Which resulted from a violation or possible violation of a statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of a Federal award, including for funds used to match Federal funds;

(b) Where the costs, at the time of the audit, are not supported by adequate documentation; or

(c) Where the costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not reflect the actions a prudent person would take in the circumstances.

(d) Questioned costs are not an improper payment until reviewed and confirmed to be improper as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C (see also the definition of improper payment in 2 CFR 200.1).
