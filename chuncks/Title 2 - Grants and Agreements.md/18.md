###### ยง 25.200 Requirements for notice of funding opportunities, regulations, and application instructions.

(a) Each Federal awarding agency that awards the types of Federal financial assistance defined in ยง 25.406 must include the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section in each notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance containing instructions for applicants that is issued on or after August 13, 2020.

(b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that applies and does not have an exemption under ยง 25.110 to:

(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information, including information on a recipient's immediate and highest level owner and subsidiaries, as well as on all predecessors that have been awarded a Federal contract or grant within the last three years, if applicable, at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency; and

(3) Provide its unique entity identifier in each application or plan it submits to the Federal awarding agency.

(c) For purposes of this policy:

(1) The applicant meets the Federal awarding agency's eligibility criteria and has the legal authority to apply and to receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a unique entity identifier. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal awarding agency program but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the unique entity identifier of the lead applicant will be used.

(2) A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a "program announcement," "notice of funding availability," "broad agency announcement," "research announcement," "solicitation," or some other term.

(3) To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the applicant is required to review and update its information in the SAM database on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.
