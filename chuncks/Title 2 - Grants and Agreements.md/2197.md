####### Section A. Records retention period.

Except as provided in Sections B through D of this article:

1. You must keep records related to any real property and equipment acquired, in whole or in part, using Federal funds under the award for 3 years after final disposition of the property. For any item of exempt property with a current fair market value greater than $5,000, and for which final disposition was not a condition of the title vesting, you must keep whatever records you need for as long as necessary to ensure that you can deduct the Federal share if you later use the property in contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes under any Federal award.

2. You must keep records related to rate proposals for indirect or facilities and administrative costs, cost allocation plans, and supporting records such as indirect cost rate computations and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback or composite fringe benefit rates) as follows:

a. If you are required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computations to your Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, as the basis for negotiation of a rate, you must keep the submissions and all supporting records for 3 years from the date on which you were required to make the submissions.

b. If you are not required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computation as the basis for negotiation, you must keep the proposal, plan, other computation, and supporting records for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year or other accounting period covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

3. You must keep other financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records pertinent to this award for a period of 3 years from the date you submit your final financial report under the award.

1. If any litigation, claim, or audit begins before the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article and the final action related to the litigation, claim, or audit is not taken before the end of that 3-year period, you must retain all records related to this award that may be involved in the litigation, claim, or audit until all findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

2. We may disallow costs and recover funds under this award based on an audit or other review of records you elected to retain beyond the retention period required by this article, even if the audit or review begins after the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article. Thus, the "retention period," as that term is used in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344(a)(1), is extended, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b), to include the entire period during which we and our authorized representatives continue to have access to those records under paragraph F.2 of this article.
