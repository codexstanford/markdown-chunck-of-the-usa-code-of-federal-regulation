####### Original signature

means an authorized signature as described in this definition. If the system (such as NSPIRES) used to submit required documents allows for electronic signatures, then the submission of the documents, by the authorized representative of the organization serves as the required original signature. If, however, a paper copy submission is required, all documents submitted shall be appropriately signed in ink with an actual signature by the authorized representative of the organization.
