######## Policy.

(b)(1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:

(i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or

(ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

(2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.
