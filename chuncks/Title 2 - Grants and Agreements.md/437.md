######## Micro-purchase threshold

means the dollar amount at or below which a non-Federal entity may purchase property or services using micro-purchase procedures (see ยง 200.320). Generally, the micro-purchase threshold for procurement activities administered under Federal awards is not to exceed the amount set by the FAR at 48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1, unless a higher threshold is requested by the non-Federal entity and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
