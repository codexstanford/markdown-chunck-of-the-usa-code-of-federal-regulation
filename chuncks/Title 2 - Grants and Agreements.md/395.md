######## Discretionary award

means an award in which the Federal awarding agency, in keeping with specific statutory authority that enables the agency to exercise judgment ("discretion"), selects the recipient and/or the amount of Federal funding awarded through a competitive process or based on merit of proposals. A discretionary award may be selected on a non-competitive basis, as appropriate.
