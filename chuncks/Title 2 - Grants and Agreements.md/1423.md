####### ยง 910.519 Criteria for Federal program risk.
######## e.g.,

(i) A DOE program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. The auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.

(ii) When significant parts of a DOE program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.

(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a DOE program or have not been corrected.

(3) DOE programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
