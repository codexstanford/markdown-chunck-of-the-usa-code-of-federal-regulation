(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.
