(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its custody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that the agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention requirement.
