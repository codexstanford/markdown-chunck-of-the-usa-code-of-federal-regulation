###### Appendix D to Part 1130 - Terms and Conditions for PROP Article IV, "Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies"
####### Section D. Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

You must request disposition instructions from the award administration office when either original or replacement equipment acquired under this award with a current fair market value that exceeds $5,000 is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other federally sponsored activities as described in paragraph C.4 of this article. For each item of equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or less, you may retain, sell, or otherwise dispose of the item with no further obligation to the Federal Government.

1. We may issue disposition instructions that:

a. Allow you to retain or sell any item of equipment after compensating us for the Federal interest in the property, which is to be computed as specified in the definition of "Federal interest;" or

b. Require you to transfer title to the equipment to a Federal agency or a third party, in which case you are entitled to compensation from us for the non-Federal interest in the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

2. If we fail to provide disposition instructions for any item of equipment within 120 calendar days of receiving your request, you may retain or sell the equipment, but you must compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the equipment.

3. If you sell the equipment:

a. You must use sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return; and

b. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.
