(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs.

(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:

(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.

(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.
