###### ยง 2900.16 Prior written approval (prior approval).

In addition to the guidance set forth in 2 CFR 200.407, for Federal awards from the Department of Labor, the non-Federal entity must request prior written approval which should include the timeframe or scope of the agreement and be submitted not less than 30 days before the requested action is to occur. Unless otherwise noted in the grant agreement or cooperative agreement, the Grant Officer is the only official with the authority to provide prior written approval (prior approval). Items included in the statement of work or budget as awarded does not constitute prior approval.
