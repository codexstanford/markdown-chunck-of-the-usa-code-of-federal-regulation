####### Section B. Federal award identification number and award date.

The "Federal Award Identification Number" and "Federal Award Date" described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), respectively, are the award number and award date for this award to you. You must provide the information in a way that makes it clear that the subaward is under this DoD award.

a. The amount of your obligation to the subrecipient, if the terms and conditions of this award do not require you to provide any cost sharing or matching for the project or program the award supports; or

b. The amount of the Federal share of your subaward obligation if this award does require cost sharing or matching, which in that case is the product of:

i. The Federal share of total project costs under this DoD award to you, as a percentage of those total project costs; and

ii. The total amount of project costs obligated for the subaward action.

2. Note that the total project costs of the award and subaward, as used in paragraphs C.1.b.i and ii of this section, include any cost sharing or matching that you or the subrecipient provides if you are counting it toward the cost sharing or matching required under this award.
