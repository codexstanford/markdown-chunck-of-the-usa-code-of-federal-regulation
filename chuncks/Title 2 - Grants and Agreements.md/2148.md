####### ยง 1136.210 Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.
######## DoD implementation.

(b)(1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended retention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).

(2)(i) Other than the exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require recipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).

(ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the "retention period," as that term is used in 2 CFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends beyond the standard 3-year retention period described in ยง 1136.205. That extension will enable disallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to retain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. Without that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which states that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient within the record retention period.
