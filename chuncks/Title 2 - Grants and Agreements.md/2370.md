Your cost-type subaward terms and conditions must require your subrecipient, with respect to each lower-tier cost-type subaward that it makes, to:

2. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.

3. Include in any cost-type subaward it makes at the next tier:

a. The informational content that SUB Article III specifies;

b. The administrative requirements that SUB Articles IV through VIII of this award specify;

c. The national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable; and

d. The requirements of this article if the next-tier subrecipient may make even lower-tier cost-type subawards to other entities.

4. Carry out the subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration responsibilities specified in SUB Article X of this award.
