######## Oversight agency for audit

means the Federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of funding directly (direct funding) (as listed on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see ยง 200.510(b)) to a non-Federal entity unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total Federal expenditures (as direct and sub-awards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated oversight agency for audit. When there is no direct funding, the Federal awarding agency which is the predominant source of pass-through funding must assume the oversight responsibilities. The duties of the oversight agency for audit and the process for any reassignments are described in ยง 200.513(b).
