######## DoD implementation.

(b)In implementing 2 CFR 200.315(c) for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, DoD:

(1) Extends to other entities the patent rights provisions of chapter 18 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code and 37 CFR part 401 that directly apply to small business firms and nonprofit organizations. This broadened applicability is in accordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in Executive Order 12591, "Facilitating Access to Science and Technology."

(2) Establishes a requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their awards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.

(3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by recipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.
