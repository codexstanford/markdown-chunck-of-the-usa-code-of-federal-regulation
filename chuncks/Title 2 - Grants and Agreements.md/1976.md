####### ยง 1132.310 National policy requirements.
######## Exceptions.

(2)(i) The Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) does not apply to a program carried out through grants or cooperative agreements unless another statute makes it apply to that program. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore may not include the provision that appendix C to this part includes as paragraph B.2 of PROC Article III unless another statute makes the Wage Rate Requirements statute apply to the program using those general terms and conditions.

(ii) If a DoD Component determines that any of the other national policy requirements in Section B will not apply to any of the awards subject to its general terms and conditions, the DoD Component may reserve the paragraphs of Section B addressing those requirements. Should a future need arise to include the requirements in a given award, the DoD Component may include them as award-specific terms and conditions.
