b.

i. The value of third-party donations of equipment, buildings, or land that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching when the third party transferred title to you or a subrecipient depends on the purpose of the award in accordance with the following:

(A) If one of the purposes of the award is to assist you or the subrecipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings, or land, you may count the aggregate fair market value of the donated property toward cost sharing or matching.

(B) If the award's purposes instead include only the support of activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, you may only charge depreciation unless you obtain our prior approval to count as cost sharing or matching the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land.

ii. The values of the donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the entity to which the third party transferred title to the property, with the qualifications specified in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(1) and (2) for donated land and buildings and donated equipment, respectively.
