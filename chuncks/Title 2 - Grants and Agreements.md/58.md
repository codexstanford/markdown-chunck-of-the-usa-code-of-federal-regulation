###### ยง 170.200 Federal awarding agency reporting requirements.

(a) Federal awarding agencies are required to publicly report Federal awards that equal or exceed the micro-purchase threshold and publish the required information on a public-facing, OMB-designated, governmentwide website and follow OMB guidance to support Transparency Act implementation.

(b) Federal awarding agencies that obtain post-award data on subaward obligations outside of this policy should take the necessary steps to ensure that their recipients are not required, due to the combination of agency-specific and Transparency Act reporting requirements, to submit the same or similar data multiple times during a given reporting period.
