####### Exception.

(g)There will be no blended payment allowance as described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section for ground mileage in those States where the Medicare carrier paid separately for all out-of-county ground ambulance mileage, but did not, before the implementation of the Medicare ambulance fee schedule, make a separate payment for any ground ambulance mileage within the county in which the beneficiary was transported. Payment for ground ambulance mileage in that State will be made based on the full ambulance fee schedule amount for ground mileage. This exception applies only to carrier-processed claims and only in those States in which the carrier paid separately for out-of-county ambulance mileage, but did not make separate payment for any in-county mileage throughout the entire State.
