####### Interim payments for new providers.

(d)(1) Newly-established providers will not have cost experience on which to base a determination of an interim rate of payment. In such cases, the contractor will use the following methods to determine an appropriate rate:

(i) If there is a provider or providers comparable in substantially all relevant factors to the provider for which the rate is needed, the contractor will base an interim rate of payment on the costs of the comparable provider.

(ii) If there are no substantially comparable providers from whom data are available, the contractor will determine an interim rate of payment based on the budgeted or projected costs of the provider.

(2) Under either method, the contractor will review the provider's cost experience after a period of three months. If need for an adjustment is indicated, the interim rate of payment will be adjusted in line with the provider's cost experience.
