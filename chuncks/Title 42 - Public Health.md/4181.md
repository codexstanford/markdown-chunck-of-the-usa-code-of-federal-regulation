(10)For purposes of Table 2, MP ismyocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.myocarditis is defined as an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) because of receiving the replication-competent smallpox vaccine.pericarditis is defined as an inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericardium) because of receiving the smallpox vaccine.myopericarditis is defined as an inflammation of both the heart muscle and its covering because of receiving the smallpox vaccine. The inflammation associated with MP may range in severity from very mild (subclinical) to life threatening. In many mild cases, myocarditis is diagnosed solely by transient electrocardiographic (EKG) abnormalities (ST segment and T wave changes), increased cardiac enzymes, or mild echocardiographic abnormalities. Arrhythmias, abnormal heart sounds, heart failure, and death may occur in more severe cases. Pericarditis generally manifests with chest pain, abnormal heart sounds (pericardial friction rub), EKG abnormalities (ST segment and T wave changes), and/or increased fluid accumulation around the heart. A Table 2 injury of MP requires sufficient evidence in the medical records of the occurrence of acute MP.
