###### ยง 1004.110 Notice of sanction.
####### Patient notification.

(d)(1)(i) The OIG will provide a sanctioned practitioner or other person an opportunity to elect to inform each of their patients of the sanction action. In order to elect this option, the sanctioned practitioner or other person must, within 30 calendar days from receipt of the OIG notice, inform both new and existing patients through written notice-based on a suggested (non-mandatory) model provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG-of the sanction and, in the case of an exclusion, its effective date. Receipt of the OIG notice is presumed to be 5 days after the date of the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. Within this same period, the practitioner or other person must also sign and return the certification that the OIG will provide with the notice. For purposes of this section, the term "all existing patients" includes all patients currently under active treatment with the practitioner or other person, as well as all patients who have been treated by the practitioner or other person within the last 3 years. In addition, the practitioner or other person must notify all prospective patients orally at the time such persons request an appointment. If the sanctioned party is a hospital, it must notify all physicians who have privileges at the hospital, and must post a notice in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding the exclusion. In addition, for purposes of this section, the term "in all affiliated entities" encompasses all entities and properties in which the hospital has a direct or indirect ownership interest of 5 percent or more and any management, partnership or control of the entity.

(ii) The certification will provide that the practitioner or other person-

(A) Has informed each of his, her or its patients in writing that the practitioner or other person has been sanctioned, or if a hospital, has informed all physicians having privileges at the hospital that it has been sanctioned;

(B) If excluded from Medicare and the State health care programs, has informed his, her or its existing patients in writing that the programs will not pay for items and services furnished or ordered (or at the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician) by the practitioner or other person until they are reinstated, or if a hospital, has provided this information to all physicians having privileges at that hospital;

(C) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs, will provide prospective patients-or if a hospital, physicians requesting privileges at that hospital prior to furnishing or ordering (or in the case of an excluded physician, medically directing or prescribing) services-oral information of both the sanction and that the programs will not pay for services provided and written notification of the same at the time of the provision of services;

(D) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs and is an entity such as a hospital, has posted a notice in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities that the programs will not pay for services provided; and

(E) Certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification and the statements in the certification.
