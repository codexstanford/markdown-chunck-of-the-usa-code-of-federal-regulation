####### An enrollee's right to waive a hearing.

(d)An enrollee may also waive the right to a hearing and request a decision based on the written evidence in the record in accordance with ยง 423.2038(b).

(1) As specified in ยง 423.2000, an ALJ may require the enrollee to attend a hearing if it is necessary to decide the case.

(2) If an ALJ determines that it is necessary to obtain testimony from a person other than the enrollee, he or she may still hold a hearing to obtain that testimony, even if the enrollee has waived the right to appear. In those cases, the ALJ would give the enrollee the opportunity to appear when the testimony is given but may hold the hearing even if the enrollee decides not to appear.
