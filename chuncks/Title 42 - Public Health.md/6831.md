####### Monthly premiums: Determination of dollar amount.

(b)(1) Effective for calendar years beginning January 1989, the dollar amount is determined based on an estimate of one-twelfth of the average per capita costs for benefits and administrative costs that will be payable with respect to individuals age 65 or over from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund during the succeeding calendar year.

(2) Before 1989, the dollar amount was determined by multiplying $33 by the ratio of the next year's inpatient deductible to $76, which was the inpatient deductible determined for 1973. (Because of cost controls, the deductible actually charged for that year was $72.)

(3) Effective for months beginning January 1994, if an individual meets the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, the monthly premium determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is reduced in each month in which the individual meets the requirements by 25 percent in 1994, 30 percent in 1995, 35 percent in 1996, 40 percent in 1997 and 45 percent in 1998 and thereafter.

(4) The amount determined under paragraphs (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section is rounded to the next nearest multiple of $1. (Fifty cents is rounded to the next higher dollar.)
