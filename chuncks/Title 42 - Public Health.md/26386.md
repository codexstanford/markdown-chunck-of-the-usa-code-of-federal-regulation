####### Standard: Involuntary discharge and transfer policies and procedures.

(f)The governing body must ensure that all staff follow the facility's patient discharge and transfer policies and procedures. The medical director ensures that no patient is discharged or transferred from the facility unless-

(1) The patient or payer no longer reimburses the facility for the ordered services;

(2) The facility ceases to operate;

(3) The transfer is necessary for the patient's welfare because the facility can no longer meet the patient's documented medical needs; or

(4) The facility has reassessed the patient and determined that the patient's behavior is disruptive and abusive to the extent that the delivery of care to the patient or the ability of the facility to operate effectively is seriously impaired, in which case the medical director ensures that the patient's interdisciplinary team-

(i) Documents the reassessments, ongoing problem(s), and efforts made to resolve the problem(s), and enters this documentation into the patient's medical record;

(ii) Provides the patient and the local ESRD Network with a 30-day notice of the planned discharge;

(iii) Obtains a written physician's order that must be signed by both the medical director and the patient's attending physician concurring with the patient's discharge or transfer from the facility;

(iv) Contacts another facility, attempts to place the patient there, and documents that effort; and

(v) Notifies the State survey agency of the involuntary transfer or discharge.

(5) In the case of immediate severe threats to the health and safety of others, the facility may utilize an abbreviated involuntary discharge procedure.
