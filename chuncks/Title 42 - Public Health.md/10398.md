####### FICA and other payroll taxes-(A) General rule.

(vi)The provider's share of FICA and other payroll taxes that the provider becomes obligated to remit to governmental agencies is included in allowable costs only during the cost reporting period in which payment (upon which the payroll taxes are based) is actually made to the employee. For example, payroll taxes applicable to vacation benefits are not to be accrued in the period in which the vacation benefits themselves are accrued but rather are allowable only in the period in which the employee takes the vacation.
