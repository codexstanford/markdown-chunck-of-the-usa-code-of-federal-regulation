###### ยง 62.25 What does the Loan Repayment Program provide?
####### Tax liability payments.

(c)The Secretary may, upon a Program participant's written request, make payments in a reasonable amount, as determined by the Secretary, to reimburse the Program participant for all or part of the increased Federal, State and local tax liability resulting from loan repayments received under the Loan Repayment Program. To maximize the Federal resources available for placing participants in HMSAs, supplementary payments for increased tax liability will only be made under unusual circumstances, and in no cases will these tax liability payments exceed 20% of the annual amounts of the loans being repaid. Program participants wishing to receive tax liability payments must submit their requests for such payments in a manner prescribed by the Secretary and must provide the Secretary with any documentation the Secretary determines is necessary to establish a Program participant's increased tax liability. The Secretary will determine, based on the availability of funds and such other factors as the Secretary determines, the amounts of any such payments that may be made.
