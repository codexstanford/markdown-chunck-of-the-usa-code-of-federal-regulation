###### Animal Care and Use Committee

means the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee established under section 13(b) of the Animal Welfare Act of 1985 and the Health Research Extension Act of 1985. For the purpose of these Standards of Care, it shall consist of at least five (5) members including the Chairperson, a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M. or V.M.D.) knowledgeable in nonhuman primate care and diseases and with delegated program responsibility, a member not affiliated with the Sanctuary, a scientist, and a member of the animal protection community. The requirement that a member of the ACUC must be from an animal protection organization is unique to this part and is not required under the Animal Welfare Regulations or the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This Committee must be established if research as defined by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations and the Public Health Service Policy (research, teaching, testing, exhibition) is to be conducted at the sanctuary.
