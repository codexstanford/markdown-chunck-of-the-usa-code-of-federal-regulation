####### General rule.

(b)The procedures for determining whether new items and services addressed in a request for a HCPCS Level II code(s) or by other means meet the definition of items and services that may be covered and paid for in accordance with this subpart are as follows:

(1) At the start of a HCPCS coding cycle, CMS performs an analysis to determine if the item or service is statutorily excluded from coverage under Medicare under section 1862 of the Act, and, if not excluded by statute, whether the item or service is parenteral or enteral nutrients, supplies, and equipment covered under the prosthetic device benefit, splints and casts or other devices used for reductions of fractures or dislocations, or IOLs inserted in a physician's office covered under the prosthetic device benefit.

(2) If a preliminary determination is made that the item or service is parenteral or enteral nutrients, supplies, and equipment covered under the prosthetic device benefit, splints and casts or other devices used for reductions of fractures or dislocations, or IOLs inserted in a physician's office covered under the prosthetic device benefit, CMS makes a preliminary payment determination for the item or service.
