###### ALJ Hearings
####### ยง 405.1020 Time and place for a hearing before an ALJ.
######## A party's right to waive a hearing.

(d)A party may also waive the right to a hearing and request a decision based on the written evidence in the record in accordance with ยง 405.1038(b). As provided in ยง 405.1000, an ALJ may require the parties to attend a hearing if it is necessary to decide the case. If an ALJ determines that it is necessary to obtain testimony from a non-party, he or she may still hold a hearing to obtain that testimony, even if all of the parties have waived the right to appear. In those cases, the ALJ will give the parties the opportunity to appear when the testimony is given but may hold the hearing even if none of the parties decide to appear.
