######## Performance standards

are the levels of performance that hospitals must meet or exceed in order to earn points under the Hospital VBP Program, and are calculated with respect to a measure for a fiscal year no later than 60 days prior to the start of the performance period for that measure for that fiscal year. The performance standards for a measure may be updated as follows:

(1) To make a single correction to correct a calculation error, data issue, or other problem that would significantly change the performance standards; or

(2) To incorporate nonsubstantive technical updates made to the measure between the time that CMS first displays the performance standards for that measure for a fiscal year and the time that CMS calculates hospital performance on that measure at the conclusion of the performance period for that measure for a fiscal year.
