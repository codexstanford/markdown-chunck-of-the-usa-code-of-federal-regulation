####### Partial QP determination.

(d)(1) An eligible clinician is a Partial QP for a year under the Medicare Option if the eligible clinician is in an APM Entity group that achieves Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding Partial QP payment amount threshold or Partial QP patient count threshold for that QP Performance Period as described in ยง 414.1430(a)(2) and (4). An eligible clinician is a Partial QP for the year under the All-Payer Combination Option if the eligible clinician achieves individually, or as part of an APM Entity group, a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding Partial QP payment amount threshold or Partial QP patient count threshold for that QP Performance Period as described in ยง 414.1430(b)(2) and (4).

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an eligible clinician is a Partial QP for a year if:

(i) The eligible clinician is included in more than one APM Entity group and none of the APM Entity groups in which the eligible clinician is included meets the corresponding QP or Partial QP threshold, or the eligible clinician is an Affiliated Practitioner; and

(ii) CMS determines that the eligible clinician individually achieves a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding Partial QP Threshold.

(3) Beginning in the 2020 QP Performance Period, an eligible clinician is not a Partial QP for a year if:

(i) The APM Entity voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from an Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period; or

(ii) The APM Entity voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from an Advanced APM at a date on which the APM Entity would not bear financial risk for that performance period under the terms of the Advanced APM.

(4) Beginning in the 2020 QP Performance Period, an eligible clinician is not a Partial QP for a year if:

(i) One or more of the APM Entities in which the eligible clinician participates voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from the Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period, and the eligible clinician does not achieve a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the Partial QP payment amount threshold or Partial QP patient count threshold based on participation in the remaining non-terminating APM Entities; or

(ii) One or more of the APM Entities in which the eligible clinician participates voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from the Advanced APM at a date on which the APM Entity would not bear financial risk under the terms of the Advanced APM, and the eligible clinician does not achieve a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the Partial QP payment amount threshold or Partial QP patient count threshold based on participation in the remaining non-terminating APM Entities.
