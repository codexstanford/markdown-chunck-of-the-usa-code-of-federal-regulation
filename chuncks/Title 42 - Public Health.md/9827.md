####### Suspension of program payments to a provider.

(e)If an contractor determines that a provider does not maintain or no longer maintains adequate records for the determination of reasonable cost under the Medicare program, payments to such provider will be suspended until the contractor is assured that adequate records are maintained. Before suspending payments to a provider, the contractor will, in accordance with the provisions in ยง 405.372(a) of this chapter, send written notice to such provider of its intent to suspend payments. The notice will explain the basis for the contractor's determination with respect to the provider's records and will identify the provider's recordkeeping deficiencies. The provider must be given the opportunity, in accordance with ยง 405.372(b) of this chapter, to submit a statement (including any pertinent evidence) as to why the suspension must not be put into effect.
