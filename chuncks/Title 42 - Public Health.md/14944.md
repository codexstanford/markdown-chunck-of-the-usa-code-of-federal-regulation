####### Uncovered expenditures

means those expenditures for health care services that are the obligation of an organization, for which an enrollee may also be liable in the event of the organization's insolvency and for which no alternative arrangements have been made that are acceptable to CMS. They include expenditures for health care services for which the organization is at risk, such as out-of-area services, referral services and hospital services. However, they do not include expenditures for services when a provider has agreed not to bill the enrollee.
