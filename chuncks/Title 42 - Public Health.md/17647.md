####### Obtaining the certification and recertification statements.

(b)No specific procedures or forms are required for certification and recertification statements. The provider may adopt any method that permits verification. The certification and recertification statements may be entered on forms, notes, or records that the appropriate individual signs, or on a special separate form. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for delayed certifications, there must be a separate signed statement for each certification or recertification. If supporting information for the signed statement is contained in other provider records (such as physicians' progress notes), it need not be repeated in the statement itself.
