(ii) For standard integrated reconsiderations, the applicable integrated plan must prepare a written explanation and send the case file to the independent review entity contracted by CMS, as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 30 calendar days from the date it receives the request (or no later than the expiration of an extension described in § 422.633(f)(3)). The applicable integrated plan must make reasonable and diligent efforts to assist in gathering and forwarding information to the independent entity; and

(iii) For expedited integrated reconsiderations, the applicable integrated plan must prepare a written explanation and send the case file to the independent review entity contracted by CMS as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than within 24 hours of its affirmation (or no later than the expiration of an extension described in § 422.633(f)(3)). The applicable integrated plan must make reasonable and diligent efforts to assist in gathering and forwarding information to the independent entity.

(2) When the applicable integrated plan affirms, in whole or in part, its adverse integrated organization determination involving a Medicaid benefit, the enrollee or other party (that is not the applicable integrated plan) may initiate a State fair hearing in the timeframe specified in § 438.408(f)(2) following the integrated plan's notice of resolution. If a provider is filing for a State fair hearing on behalf of the enrollee as permitted by State law, the provider needs the written consent of the enrollee, if he or she has not already obtained such consent.
