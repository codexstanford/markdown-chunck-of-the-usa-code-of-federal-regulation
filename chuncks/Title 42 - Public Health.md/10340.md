####### Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (NQDC)

means an elective or non-elective plan, agreement, method, or arrangement between an employer and an employee to pay the employee compensation in the future. In comparison with qualified plans, nonqualified plans do not provide employers and employees with the tax benefits associated with qualified plans because NQDC plans do not satisfy all the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a).
