####### Tour Summation and Focus of Remaining Survey Activity.

(6)When the tour is completed, review the resident census data provided by the facility. Determine if the care categories specified in the section on Resident Sample are sufficiently represented in the random selection, make adjustments as needed, and complete the listing of residents on the worksheet labeled "Residents Selected for In-depth Review", Form CMS-520.

Transcribe notes of a negative nature onto the SRF in the "Remarks" column under the appropriate rule. Findings from a later segment in the survey or gathered by another surveyor may combine to substantiate a deficiency. You need not check "met" or "not met" at this point in the survey. Discuss significant impressions/conclusions at the completion of each subsequent survey task, and transfer any negative findings onto the Survey Report Form in the Remarks section.
