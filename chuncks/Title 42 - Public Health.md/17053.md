####### Amount of subsidy payment.

(a)(1) For each qualifying covered retiree enrolled with the sponsor of a qualified retiree prescription drug plan in a plan year, the sponsor receives a subsidy payment in the amount of 28 percent of the allowable retiree costs (as defined in ยง 423.882) in the plan year for such retiree attributable to gross retiree costs between the cost threshold and the cost limit as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The subsidy payment is calculated by first determining gross retiree costs between the cost threshold and cost limit, and then determining allowable retiree costs attributable to the gross retiree costs. For this purpose and where otherwise relevant in this subpart, plan year is the calendar, policy, or fiscal year on which the records of a plan are kept.
