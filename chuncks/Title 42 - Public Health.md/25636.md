###### ยง 489.65 Amount of the bond.
####### Computation of the 15 percent: Participating HHA.

(b)The 15 percent is computed as follows:

(1) For the initial bond-on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS to the HHA in the HHA's most recent fiscal year as shown in the HHA's most recent cost report that has been accepted by CMS. If the initial bond will cover less than a full fiscal year, the computation of the 15 percent will be based on the number of months of the fiscal year that the bond will cover.

(2) For subsequent bonds-on the basis of Medicare payments made by CMS in the most recent fiscal year for which a cost report has been accepted. However, if payments in the first six months of the current fiscal year differ from such an amount by more than 25 percent, then the amount of the bond is 15 percent of such payments projected on an annualized basis.
