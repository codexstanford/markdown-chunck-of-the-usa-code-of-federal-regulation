######## Exceptions to applicability.

(i)(1) The provisions of this section do not apply to the time period for which interest is payable under ยง 413.64(j) of this chapter because the provider seeks judicial review of a decision of the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, or a subsequent reversal, affirmance, or modification of that decision by the Administrator. Prior to that time, until the provider seeks judicial review, interest accrues at the rate specified in this section on outstanding unpaid balances resulting from final determinations as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) If an overpayment or an underpayment determination is reversed administratively or judicially, and the reversal is no longer subject to appeal, appropriate adjustments will be made with respect to the overpayment or underpayment and the amount of interest charged.
