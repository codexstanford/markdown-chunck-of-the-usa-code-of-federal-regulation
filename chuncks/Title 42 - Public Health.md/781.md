####### Combining claims.

(e)(1) Two or more covered entities may jointly file claims of overcharges by the same manufacturer for the same drug or drugs if each covered entity that could file a claim against the manufacturer consents to the jointly filed claim, including submission of the required documentation, described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) An association or organization may file claims of overcharges by the same manufacturer for the same drug or drugs on behalf of multiple covered entities if each covered entity represented could file a claim against the manufacturer, is a member of the association or organization, meets the requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section, including submission of the required documentation, and each covered entity has agreed to representation by the association or organization on its behalf.

(3) A manufacturer or manufacturers may request to consolidate claims brought by more than one manufacturer against the same covered entity if each manufacturer could individually file a claim against the covered entity, consents to the filing of the consolidated claim, meets the requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section for that claim, and the 340B ADR Panel determines that such consolidation is appropriate and consistent with the goals of fairness and economy of sources. The 340B ADR Panel will not permit consolidated claims filed on behalf of manufacturers by associations or organizations representing their interests.
