####### General cost sharing limits.

(6)Cost sharing for basic benefits specified by CMS does not exceed levels annually determined by CMS to be discriminatory for such services. For each year beginning on or after January 1, 2023, a MA organization must establish cost sharing for basic benefits that complies with the cost sharing limits in this paragraph (f)(6), paragraph (j) of this section, and ยง 422.113(b)(2), which are in addition to any other limits and rules applicable to MA cost sharing, including the requirement in ยง 422.254(b)(4) that overall MA cost sharing for basic benefits be actuarially equivalent to Medicare FFS cost sharing. Cost sharing may be a coinsurance or copayment; a cost sharing limit is calculated for a plan benefit package service category or for a reasonable group of benefits covered under the plan. For purposes of cost sharing evaluation, the analysis is completed at the plan (or segment) level. An MA plan must not charge an enrollee a copayment for a basic benefit that is greater than the cost of the covered service(s).
