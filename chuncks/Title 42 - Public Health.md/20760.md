####### Care and coordination of services for all MCO, PIHP, and PAHP enrollees.

(b)Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must implement procedures to deliver care to and coordinate services for all MCO, PIHP, and PAHP enrollees. These procedures must meet State requirements and must do the following:

(1) Ensure that each enrollee has an ongoing source of care appropriate to his or her needs and a person or entity formally designated as primarily responsible for coordinating the services accessed by the enrollee. The enrollee must be provided information on how to contact their designated person or entity;

(2) Coordinate the services the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP furnishes to the enrollee:

(i) Between settings of care, including appropriate discharge planning for short term and long-term hospital and institutional stays;

(ii) With the services the enrollee receives from any other MCO, PIHP, or PAHP;

(iii) With the services the enrollee receives in FFS Medicaid; and

(iv) With the services the enrollee receives from community and social support providers.

(3) Provide that the MCO, PIHP or PAHP makes a best effort to conduct an initial screening of each enrollee's needs, within 90 days of the effective date of enrollment for all new enrollees, including subsequent attempts if the initial attempt to contact the enrollee is unsuccessful;

(4) Share with the State or other MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs serving the enrollee the results of any identification and assessment of that enrollee's needs to prevent duplication of those activities;

(5) Ensure that each provider furnishing services to enrollees maintains and shares, as appropriate, an enrollee health record in accordance with professional standards; and

(6) Ensure that in the process of coordinating care, each enrollee's privacy is protected in accordance with the privacy requirements in 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 subparts A and E, to the extent that they are applicable.
