####### Individual claim review.

(1)(i) If neither the contractor nor CMS appeals the ALJ decision under ยง 426.425(b), and if the party's claim or appeal(s) was previously denied, the contractor, an M + C organization or another Medicare managed care organization must reopen the claim of the party who challenged the LCD and adjudicate the claim without using the provision(s) of the LCD that the ALJ found invalid.

(ii) If a revised LCD is issued, the contractor, the M + C organization, and any other Medicare managed care organization within the contractor's jurisdiction uses the revised LCD in reviewing claim or appeal submissions or request for services delivered or services performed on or after the effective date of the revised LCD.

(iii) If the aggrieved party who sought the review has not yet submitted a claim, the contractor adjudicates the claim without using the provision(s) of the LCD that the ALJ found invalid.

(iv) In either case, the claim and any subsequent claims for the service provided under the same circumstances is adjudicated without using the LCD provision(s) found invalid.
