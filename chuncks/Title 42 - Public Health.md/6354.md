####### A party or an affected nonparty.

(1)A party or an affected nonparty, such as CMS, involved in proceedings before a reviewing entity.

(i) As applied to a party or an affected nonparty, the phrase "date of receipt" in this definition is synonymous with the term "notice," as that term is used in section 1878 of the Act and in this subpart.

(ii) For purposes of a contractor hearing, if no contractor hearing officer is appointed (or none is currently presiding), the date of receipt of materials sent to the contractor hearing officer (as permitted under paragraph (d) of this section) is presumed to be, as applicable, the date that the contractor stamps "Received" on the materials, or the date of electronic delivery.

(iii) The date of receipt by a party or affected nonparty of documents involved in proceedings before a reviewing entity is presumed to be 5 days after the date of issuance of a contractor notice or a reviewing entity document. This presumption, which is otherwise conclusive, may be overcome if it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that such materials were actually received on a later date.
