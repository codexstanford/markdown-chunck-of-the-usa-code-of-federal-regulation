####### General provisions.

(a)If a hospital is found to be out of compliance with one or more conditions of participation for hospitals, as specified in part 482 of this chapter, a temporary waiver may be granted by CMS. CMS may extend a temporary waiver only if such a waiver would not jeopardize or adversely affect the health and safety of patients. The waiver may be issued for any one year period or less under certain circumstances. The waiver may be withdrawn earlier if CMS determines this action is necessary to protect the health and safety of patients. A waiver may be granted only if:

(1) The hospital is located in a rural area. This includes all areas not delineated as "urban" by the Bureau of the Census, based on the most recent census;

(2) The hospital has 50 or fewer inpatient hospital beds;

(3) The character and seriousness of the deficiencies do not adversely affect the health and safety of patients; and

(4) The hospital has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with personnel requirements consistent with any waiver.
