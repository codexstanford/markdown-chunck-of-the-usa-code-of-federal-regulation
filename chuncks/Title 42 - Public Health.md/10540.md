###### ยง 413.139 Depreciation: Optional allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.
####### Principle.

(a)With respect to all assets acquired before 1966, the provider, at its option, may choose an allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs. The operating costs to be used are the provider's 1965 operating costs or the provider's current year's allowable costs, whichever are the lower. The percentage to be applied is 5 percent starting with the year 1966-67, with such percentage being uniformly reduced by one-half percent each succeeding year. The allowance based on operating costs is in addition to regular depreciation on assets acquired after 1965; however, if the optional allowance is selected, the combined amount of such allowance on pre-1966 assets and the straight-line depreciation on assets acquired after 1965 (including the estimated depreciation on assets held on a rental basis during the current year) may not exceed 6 percent of the provider's allowable cost for the current year.
