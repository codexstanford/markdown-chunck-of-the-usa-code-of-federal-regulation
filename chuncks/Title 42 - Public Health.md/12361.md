####### Expected expenditures.

(6)For the purposes of this section, expected expenditures is defined as the Other Payer APM benchmark. For episode payment models, expected expenditures means the episode target price. For purposes of assessing financial risk for Other Payer Advanced APM determinations, the expected expenditures under the payment arrangement should not exceed the expenditures for a participant in the absence of the payment arrangement. If expected expenditures under the payment arrangement exceed the expenditures that the participant would be expected to incur in the absence of the payment arrangement, such excess expenditures are not considered when assessing financial risk under the payment arrangement for Other Payer Advanced APM determinations.
