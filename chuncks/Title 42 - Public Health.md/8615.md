####### Updating previous standardized amounts.

(c)(1) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1985 through fiscal year 2003, CMS computes average standardized amounts for hospitals in urban areas and rural areas within the United States, and in urban areas and rural areas within each region. For discharges occurring in fiscal year 2004, CMS computes an average standardized amount for hospitals located in all areas.

(2) Each of those amounts is equal to the respective adjusted average standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1984 under ยง 412.62(g)-

(i) Increased for fiscal year 1985 by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital market basket;

(ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements;

(iii) Reduced by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) of the total amount of prospective payments that are additional payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F of this part; and

(iv) Adjusted for budget neutrality under paragraph (h) of this section.

(3) For fiscal year 1986 and thereafter. CMS computes, for urban and rural hospitals in the United States and for urban and rural hospitals in each region, average standardized amount equal to the respective adjusted average standardized amounts computed for the previous fiscal year-

(i) Increased by the applicable percentage increase determined under paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section;

(ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements; and

(iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1985 and before October 1, 1986, reduced by a proportion (estimated by CMS) of the amount of payments based on the total amount of prospective payments that are additional payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F of this part, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, reduced by a proportion (estimated by CMS) of the amount of payments that, based on the total amount of prospective payments for urban hospitals and the total amount of prospective payments for rural hospitals, are additional payments attributable to outlier cases in such hospitals under subpart F of this part.

(4) For fiscal years 1987 through 1990 CMS standardizes the average standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of the payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.

(5) For fiscal years 1987 through 2004, CMS standardizes the average standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of indirect medical education payments.
