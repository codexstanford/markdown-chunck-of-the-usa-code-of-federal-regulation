####### Application: Payment on other than a fee-for-service basis.

(2)If the HCPP pays for physicians' services and other Part B supplier services on other than a fee-for-service basis-

(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the costs incurred by the HCPP may be considered reasonable if they-

(A) Do not exceed those that a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would incur to purchase those services; and

(B) Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished by similar physicians and other suppliers in the same or a similar locality.

(ii)(A) If a physician group to whom the HCPP makes payment compensates its physicians on a fee-for-service basis, the HCPP's payment to the group may not exceed the reasonable charges for those services, as defined in subpart E of part 405 of this chapter.

(B) Payment in excess of the limits specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is allowable if the group has procedures under which members of the group accept effective incentives, such as risk-sharing, designed to avoid unnecessary or unduly costly utilization of health services. In such cases, the amount paid by the HCPP is considered reasonable if it meets the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
