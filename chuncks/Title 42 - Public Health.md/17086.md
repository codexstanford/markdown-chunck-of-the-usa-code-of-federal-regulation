####### Good cause.

(4)For purposes of this section, CMS finds good cause if-

(i) New and material evidence exists that was not readily available at the time the initial determination was made;

(ii) A clerical error in the computation of payments was made; or

(iii) The evidence that was considered in making the determination clearly shows on its face that an error was made.

(5) For purposes of this section, CMS does not find good cause if the only reason for reopening is a change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling upon which the initial determination was made.

(6) A decision by CMS not to reopen an initial or reconsidered determination is final and binding and cannot be appealed.
