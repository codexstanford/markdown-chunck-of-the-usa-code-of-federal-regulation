###### ยง 83.13 How will NIOSH evaluate petitions, other than petitions by claimants covered under ยง 83.14?

(a) NIOSH will collect information on the types and levels of radiation exposures that potential members of the class may have incurred, as specified under 42 CFR 83.14, from the following potential sources, as necessary:

(1) The petition or petitions submitted on behalf of the class;

(2) DOE and AWE facility records and information;

(3) Potential members of the class and their survivors;

(4) Labor organizations who represent or represented employees at the facility during the relevant period of employment;

(5) Managers, radiation safety officials, and other witnesses present during the relevant period of employment at the DOE facility or AWE facility;

(6) NIOSH records from epidemiological research on DOE populations and records from dose reconstructions conducted under 42 CFR part 82;

(8) Other sources.

(b) The Director of OCAS may determine that records and/or information requested from DOE, an AWE, or another source to evaluate a petition is not, or will not be, available on a timely basis. Such a determination will be treated, for the purposes of the petition evaluation, as equivalent to a finding that the records and/or information requested are not available.
