####### Complex patient bonus.

(3)For the CY 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 MIPS payment years and associated performance periods, provided that a MIPS eligible clinician, group, virtual group or APM Entity submits data for at least one MIPS performance category for the applicable performance period for the MIPS payment year, a complex patient bonus will be added to the final score for the MIPS payment year, as stated in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. For the CY 2022 MIPS performance period/CY 2024 MIPS payment year, provided that a MIPS eligible clinician, group, subgroup, virtual group or APM Entity submits data for at least one MIPS performance category for the applicable performance period for the MIPS payment year, a complex patient bonus will be added to the final score for the MIPS payment year, if applicable, as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) through (viii) of this section. Beginning with the CY 2023 MIPS performance period/CY 2025 MIPS payment year, provided that a MIPS eligible clinician, group, subgroup, virtual group or APM Entity submits data for at least one MIPS performance category for the applicable performance period for the MIPS payment year, or is a facility-based MIPS eligible clinician, a complex patient bonus will be added to the final score for the MIPS payment year, if applicable, as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) through (viii) of this section.

(i) For the CY 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 MIPS payment years and associated performance periods, for MIPS eligible clinicians and groups, the complex patient bonus is calculated as follows: [The average HCC risk score assigned to beneficiaries (pursuant to the HCC risk adjustment model established by CMS pursuant to section 1853(a)(1) of the Act) seen by the MIPS eligible clinician or seen by clinicians in a group] + [the dual eligible ratio x 5].

(ii) For the CY 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 MIPS payment years and associated performance periods, for APM Entities and virtual groups, the complex patient bonus is calculated as follows: [The beneficiary weighted average HCC risk score for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation within the APM Entity or virtual group, respectively] + [the average dual eligible ratio for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation, within the APM Entity or virtual group, respectively, x 5].

(iii) For the 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 MIPS payment years and associated performance periods, the complex patient bonus cannot exceed 5.0 except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.

(iv) For the 2022 and 2023 MIPS payment years and associated performance periods, the complex patient bonus is calculated pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, and the resulting numerical value is then multiplied by 2.0. The complex patient bonus cannot exceed 10.0.

(v) Beginning with the CY 2022 MIPS performance period/CY 2024 MIPS payment year, the complex patient bonus is limited to MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, subgroups, APM Entities, and virtual groups with a risk indicator at or above the risk indicator calculated median. To determine the median for the respective risk indicator (HCC and dual proportion), risk indicators associated with the final score assigned to a clinician from the most recent prior performance period, for all those who have submitted data for at least one MIPS performance category or are facility-based, are used.

(vi) Beginning with the CY 2022 MIPS performance period/CY 2024 MIPS payment year, for MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, and subgroups, the complex patient bonus components are calculated as follows for the specific risk indicators: Medical complex patient bonus component = 1.5 + 4 * associated HCC standardized score calculated with the average HCC risk score assigned to beneficiaries (pursuant to the HCC risk adjustment model established by CMS pursuant to section 1853(a)(1) of the Act) seen by the MIPS eligible clinician or seen by clinicians in a group or subgroup; social complex patient bonus component = 1.5 + 4 * associated dual proportion standardized score. The components are added together to calculate one overall complex patient bonus. A standardized score for each risk indicator is determined based on the mean and standard deviation of the raw risk indicator score and provides a standardized measurement of how far each risk score is from the mean: (raw risk indicator score-risk indicator mean)/risk indicator standard deviation.

(vii) Beginning with the CY 2022 MIPS performance period/CY 2024 MIPS payment year, for APM Entities and virtual groups, the complex patient bonus components are calculated as follows for the specific risk indicators: Medical complex patient bonus component = 1.5 + 4 * the beneficiary weighted average HCC risk standardized score for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation within the APM Entity or virtual group, respectively; social complex patient bonus component = 1.5 + 4 * the average dual proportion standardized score for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation, within the APM Entity or virtual group, respectively. The components are added together to calculate one overall complex patient bonus. A standardized score for each risk indicator is determined based on the mean and standard deviation of the raw risk indicator score and provides a standardized measurement of how far each risk score is from the mean: (raw risk indicator score-risk indicator mean)/risk indicator standard deviation.

(viii) Beginning with the CY 2022 MIPS performance period/CY 2024 MIPS payment year, the complex patient bonus cannot exceed 10.0 and cannot be below 0.0.
