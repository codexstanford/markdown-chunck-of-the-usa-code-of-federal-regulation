####### Exception for decertified EHR technology.

(5)The Secretary shall exempt an EP from the application of the payment adjustment for CY 2018 under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user is not possible because the certified EHR technology used by the EP has been decertified under ONC's Health IT Certification Program. To be considered for an exception, an EP must submit, in the manner specified by CMS, an application demonstrating that the certified EHR technology was decertified during the 12-month period preceding the applicable EHR reporting period for the CY 2018 payment adjustment year, or during the applicable EHR reporting period for the CY 2018 payment adjustment year, and that the EP made a good faith effort to obtain another certified EHR technology for that EHR reporting period. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted no later than October 1, 2017, or a later date specified by CMS.
