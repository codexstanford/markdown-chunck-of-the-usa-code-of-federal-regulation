####### Worker protection plan and personal protective Equipment.

(i)(1) In addition to complying with the requirements of this section, an importer must comply with all relevant federal and state requirements relating to occupational health and safety.

(2) Importers must have a written worker protection plan for anyone whose duties may result in exposure to NHPs, including procedures for appropriate response measures in the event of an emergency. An importer must adhere to the plan and SOPs and must ensure that each worker covered under the plan also adheres to it and all pertinent SOPs.

(3) An importer must contact HHS/CDC immediately by telephone, text, or email, as specified in the importer's SOP, to report any instance of a worker exposed to a zoonotic illness and must include instructions for contacting HHS/CDC in its worker protection plan.

(4) A worker protection plan must include the following:

(i) Procedures to protect and train transport workers in how to avoid and respond to zoonotic disease exposures associated with NHPs, including procedures for appropriate responses in the event of a vehicle crash or other emergency during transport;

(ii) Hazard evaluation and worker communication procedures that adhere to those in paragraph (i)(5) of this section;

(iii) PPE requirements that adhere to those in paragraph (i)(6) of this section;

(iv) TB-control requirements that adhere to those in paragraph (i)(7) of this section;

(v) If applicable, SOPs that adhere to requirements relating to macaques as described in paragraph (i)(8) of this section;

(vi) An infection-prevention program, including infection-prevention methods requiring, at a minimum, PPE and workplace practices for preventing infection among workers whose duties may result in exposure to NHPs and:

(A) SOPs that include requirements for preventing workplace infection from potentially contaminated needles or other sharp instruments and that, at a minimum, prohibit workers from recapping used needles by hand; removing needles by hand; or otherwise bending, breaking, or manipulating used needles by hand.

(B) SOPs requiring that used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items be placed in puncture-resistant containers kept as close to the work site as practical and disinfected and/or disposed of as hazardous waste.

(C) SOPs requiring that removable, disposable PPE be autoclaved, incinerated, or otherwise disposed of as biohazardous waste. Nondisposable clothing worn in the quarantine facility must be disinfected on site before laundering.

(D) An infection-prevention program that requires NHP handlers to cleanse all bites, scratches, and/or mucosal surfaces or abraded skin exposed to blood or body fluids immediately and thoroughly.

(E) Infection-prevention procedures that require workers to immediately flush their eyes with water for at least 15 minutes following an exposure of blood or body fluids to the eye.

(vii) Post-exposure procedures that provide potentially exposed workers with direct and rapid access to a medical consultant including:

(A) Procedures ensuring that exposed workers have direct and immediate access to a medical consultant who has been previously identified in the SOPs to HHS/CDC.

(B) For potential exposures to herpes B virus, post-exposure procedures that require the routing of diagnostic specimens to the National B Virus Resource Center located at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia, or another location as specified by HHS/CDC.

(viii) Procedures for documenting the frequency of worker training, including for those working in the quarantine facility.

(5) As part of the worker protection plan described in this paragraph (i), an importer must establish, implement, and maintain hazard evaluation and worker communication procedures that include the following:

(i) A description of the known zoonotic disease and injury hazards associated with handling NHPs;

(ii) The need for PPE when handling NHPs and training in proper use of PPE, including re-training and reinforcement of appropriate use;

(iii) Procedures for monitoring workers for signs of zoonotic illness, including procedures that ensure reporting to HHS/CDC by telephone, text, or email within 24 hours of the occurrence of illness in any worker suspected of having a zoonotic disease; and

(iv) Procedures for disinfection of garments, supplies, equipment, and waste.

(6) As part of the worker protection plan described in this paragraph (i), an importer must identify the PPE required for each task or working area. Additionally, in this part of the worker protection plan, an importer must ensure the following:

(i) Any required PPE must be available to workers when needed;

(ii) Workers in direct contact with NHPs must wear the following:

(A) Gloves of sufficient thickness to reduce the risk of cuts, scratches, and punctures;

(B) At a minimum, disposable NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR ยง 1910.134, which requires a respiratory protection program;

(C) Face shields or eye protection; and

(D) Outer protective clothing when opening crates, removing foreign materials from crates, feeding NHPs, removing dead NHPs, or handling bedding materials.

(iii) Workers handling crates or pallets containing NHPs must wear the following:

(E) Face shields or eye protection.

(iv) Workers whose faces may come within 5 feet of an NHP must wear disposable NIOSH-approved N95 respirators and either face shields or eye protection to protect against aerosol or droplet transmission of pathogens;

(v) Workers must remove disposable PPE and discard as a biohazard; and

(vi) Workers must not drink, eat, or smoke while physically handling NHPs or cages, crates, or other materials from such NHPs.

(7) For TB protection, an importer must ensure the following:

(i) Workers in a facility housing NHPs must have a baseline evaluation for TB prior to working with NHPs and an evaluation at least annually;

(ii) Prompt and direct access to a medical consultant who is capable of performing the evaluation and maintaining records for such tests;

(iii) If an NHP is found to have laboratory-confirmed TB, any worker who had previously entered any room where a confirmed NHP has been housed must promptly undergo a post-exposure TB evaluation and

(A) If that test is negative, the worker must undergo another TB evaluation 3 months later; and

(B) If either test is reactive, the worker must be referred for medical evaluation; and

(C) The HHS/CDC must be immediately notified of the results of the medical evaluation by telephone, text, or email as specified in the importer's SOPs.

(iv) Compliance with exposure-control planning elements under 29 CFR 1910.1030 for workers who will have parenteral and other contact with blood or other potentially infectious material from NHPs and compliance with the respiratory protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.134.
