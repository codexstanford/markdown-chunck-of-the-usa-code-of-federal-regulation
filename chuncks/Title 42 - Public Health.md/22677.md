####### Methodology for estimate of number of uninsured, low-income children.

(c)(1) To report on the progress made in reducing the number of uninsured, low-income children as required in paragraph (b) of this section, a State must choose a methodology to establish an initial baseline estimate of the number of low-income children who are uninsured in the State.

(i) A State may base the estimate on data from-

(A) The March supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS);

(B) A State-specific survey;

(C) A statistically adjusted CPS; or

(D) Another appropriate source.

(ii) If the State does not base the estimate on data from the March supplement to the CPS, the State must submit a description of the methodology used to develop the initial baseline estimate and the rationale for its use.

(2) The State must provide an annual estimate of changes in the number of uninsured in the State using-

(i) The same methodology used in establishing the initial baseline; or

(ii) Another methodology based on new information that enables the State to establish a new baseline.

(3) If a new methodology is used, the State must also provide annual estimates based on either the March supplement to the CPS or the methodology used to develop the initial baseline.
