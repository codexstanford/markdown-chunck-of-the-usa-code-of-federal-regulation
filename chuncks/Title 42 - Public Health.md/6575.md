######## Refunds to beneficiaries.

(d)(1) The FQHC must agree to refund as promptly as possible any money incorrectly collected from Medicare beneficiaries or from someone on their behalf.

(2) As used in this section, "money incorrectly collected" means any amount for covered services that is greater than the amount for which the beneficiary was liable because of the coinsurance requirements specified in part 410, subpart E.

(3) Amounts also are considered incorrectly collected if the FQHC believed the beneficiary was not entitled to Medicare benefits but-

(i) The beneficiary was later determined to have been so entitled;

(ii) The beneficiary's entitlement period fell within the time the FQHC's agreement with CMS was in effect; and

(iii) The amounts exceed the beneficiary's coinsurance liability.
