###### ยง 413.139 Depreciation: Optional allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.
####### Change to actual depreciation.

(e)(1) A provider that elects this allowance may at any time before 1976 change to actual depreciation on all pre-1966 depreciable assets. In such case, this option is eliminated and the provider can no longer elect to receive an allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.

(2) If the provider desires to change to actual depreciation but either has no historical cost records or has incomplete records, the determination of historical cost may be made through appropriate means involving expert consultation with the determination being subject to review and approval by the contractor.
