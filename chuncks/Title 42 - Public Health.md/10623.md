####### Documentation for a payment rate exception request.

(e)If the facility is requesting an exception to its payment rate, it must submit to CMS its most recently completed cost report as required under ยง 413.198 and whatever statistics, data, and budgetary projections as determined by CMS to be needed to adjudicate each type of exception. CMS may audit any cost report or other information submitted. The materials submitted to CMS must-

(1) Separately identify elements of cost contributing to costs per treatment in excess of the facility's payment rate;

(2) Show that the facility's costs, including those costs that are not directly attributable to the exception criteria, are allowable and reasonable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part;

(3) Show that the elements of excessive cost are specifically attributable to one or more conditions specified in ยง 413.182;

(4) Specify the amount of additional payment per treatment the facility believes is required for it to recover its justifiable excess costs; and

(5) Specify that the facility has compared its most recently completed cost report with cost reports from (at least 2) prior years. The facility must explain any material statistical data or cost changes, or both, and include an explanation with the documentation supporting the exception request.
