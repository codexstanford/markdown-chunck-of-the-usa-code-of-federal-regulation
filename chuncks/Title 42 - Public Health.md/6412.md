###### § 405.1834 CMS reviewing official procedure.
####### Effect of a decision: Remand.

(f)(1) A decision of affirmation, reversal, or modification by the CMS reviewing official is final and binding on each party and the contractor. No further review or appeal of a decision is available, but the decision may be reopened and revised by a CMS reviewing official in accordance with § 405.1885 through § 405.1889 of this subpart. Decisions of a CMS reviewing official are subject to the provisions of § 405.1803(d) of this subpart. A decision by a CMS reviewing official remanding an appeal to the contractor hearing officer(s) for further proceedings under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is not a final decision.

(2) A remand to the contractor hearing officer(s) by the CMS reviewing official must-

(i) Vacate the contractor hearing officer decision;

(ii) Be governed by the same criteria that apply to remands by the Administrator to the Board under § 405.1875(f)(2) of this subpart, and require the contractor hearing officer(s) to take specific actions on remand; and

(iii) Result in the contractor hearing officer(s) taking the actions required on remand and issuing a new contractor hearing decision in accordance with §§ 405.1831 and 405.1833 of this subpart.
