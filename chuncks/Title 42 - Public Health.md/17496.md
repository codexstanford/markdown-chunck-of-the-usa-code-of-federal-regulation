####### Initial enrollment year compensation.

(2)For each enrollment in an initial enrollment year, Part D sponsors may pay compensation at or below FMV.

(i) Part D sponsors may pay either a full or pro-rated initial enrollment year compensation for:

(A) A beneficiary's first year of enrollment in any plan; or

(B) A beneficiary's move from an employer group plan to a non-employer group plan (either within the same parent organization or between parent organizations).

(ii) Part D sponsors must pay pro-rated initial enrollment year compensation for:

(A) A beneficiary's plan change(s) during their initial enrollment year.

(B) A beneficiary's selection of an "unlike plan type" change. In that case, the new plan would only pay the months that the beneficiary is enrolled, and the previous plan would recoup the months that the beneficiary was not in the plan.
