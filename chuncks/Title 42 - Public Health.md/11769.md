####### Routine delivery

means delivery of a drug within 2 business days in appropriate shipping and packaging in all areas of the United States and its territories, with the exception of the Pacific Territories. In the Pacific Territories, routine delivery of drug means delivery of a CAP drug within 7 business days in appropriate shipping and packaging. In each case, this timeframe will be reduced if product stability requires it, meaning that the manufacturer's labeling instructions, drug compendia, or specialized drug stability references indicate that a shorter delivery timeframe is necessary to avoid adversely affecting the product's integrity, safety, or efficacy.
