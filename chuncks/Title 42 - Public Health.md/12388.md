(c)

(1) Attributed beneficiaries are determined from each Advanced APM Entity's attributed beneficiary lists generated by each Advanced APM's specific attribution methodology except as set forth in this paragraph (c)(1). (i) Beneficiaries who have been prospectively attributed to an APM Entity for a QP Performance Period will be excluded from the attribution-eligible beneficiary count for any other APM Entity that is participating in an APM where that beneficiary would be ineligible to be added to the APM Entity's attributed beneficiary list.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) When operationally feasible, this attributed beneficiary list will be the final beneficiary list used for reconciliation purposes in the Advanced APM.

(3) When it is not operationally feasible to use the final attributed beneficiary list, the attributed beneficiary list will be taken from the Advanced APM's most recently available attributed beneficiary list at the end of the QP Performance Period.
