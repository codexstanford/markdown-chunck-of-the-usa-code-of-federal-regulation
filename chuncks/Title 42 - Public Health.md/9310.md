######## Transfer adjustment factor.

(3)(i) For base year cost reporting periods ending on or before December 31, 1990, CMS uses the base year MEDPAR data received as of June 30, 1991 to develop an adjustment to discharges to account for transfers. CMS divides the length of stay for each transfer case by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG (but in no case using a number greater than 1.0) and assigns each nontransfer case a value of 1.0. To determine the transfer adjustment factor, CMS adds together the adjusted discharges and divides the result by total discharges including transfers.

(ii) For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 1990 but beginning before October 1, 1991, CMS determines a transfer adjustment factor as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for a hospital using the applicable base year MEDPAR data on file as of the December 31 or June 30 occurring at least 6 months after the close of the approved base year.

(iii) For base year cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary determines the transfer adjustment factor in place of CMS as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section based on the most recent billing data available as of the date of the final determination of the hospital-specific rate.
