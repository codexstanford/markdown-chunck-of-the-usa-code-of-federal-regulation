####### Significant local skin reaction.

(3)Significant local skin reaction is an unexpected and extreme response at the vaccination or inoculation site that results in a significant scar that is serious enough to require surgical intervention. The onset of this injury is the initial skin lesion at the vaccination site that generally occurs with replication-competent smallpox vaccinations. Minor scarring or minor local reactions do not constitute a Table 2 injury. A robust take, defined as an area of redness at the vaccination site that exceeds 7.5 cm in diameter with associated swelling, warmth and pain, is generally considered an expected response to the vaccination or inoculation. A robust take, in itself, does not constitute a Table 2 injury, even when the redness and swelling involves the entire upper arm with associated enlargement and tenderness of the glands (lymph nodes) in the underarm (axilla).
