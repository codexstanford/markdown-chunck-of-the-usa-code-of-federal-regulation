####### Benchmarks.

(ii)Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, benchmarks will be based on performance by collection type, from all available sources, including MIPS eligible clinicians and APMs, to the extent feasible, during the applicable baseline or performance period.

(A) Each benchmark must have a minimum of 20 individual clinicians or groups who reported the measure meeting the case minimum requirement at paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and the data completeness requirement at ยง 414.1340 and having a performance rate that is greater than zero.

(B) CMS Web Interface collection type uses benchmarks from the corresponding reporting year of the Shared Savings Program.

(C) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS payment year, for each measure that has a benchmark that CMS determines may have the potential to result in inappropriate treatment, CMS will set benchmarks using a flat percentage for all collection types where the top decile is higher than 90 percent under the methodology at paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(D) Beginning with the CY 2023 performance period/2025 MIPS payment year, CMS will calculate a benchmark for an administrative claims quality measure using the performance on the measures during the current performance period.
