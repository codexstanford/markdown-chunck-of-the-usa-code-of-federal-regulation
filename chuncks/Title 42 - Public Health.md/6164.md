####### ยง 405.1052 Dismissal of a request for a hearing before an ALJ or request for review of a QIC dismissal.
######## Withdrawal of request.

(c)At any time before notice of the decision, dismissal, or remand is mailed, if only one party requested the hearing or review of the QIC dismissal and that party asks to withdraw the request, an ALJ or attorney adjudicator may dismiss the request for hearing or request for review of a QIC dismissal. This request for withdrawal may be submitted in writing, or a request to withdraw a request for hearing may be made orally at a hearing before the ALJ. The request for withdrawal must include a clear statement that the appellant is withdrawing the request for hearing or review of the QIC dismissal and does not intend to further proceed with the appeal. If an attorney or other legal professional on behalf of a beneficiary or other appellant files the request for withdrawal, the ALJ or attorney adjudicator may presume that the representative has advised the appellant of the consequences of the withdrawal and dismissal.
