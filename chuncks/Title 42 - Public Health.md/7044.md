###### ยง 408.50 When premiums are considered paid.
####### Actual deduction.

(a)A premium is considered paid if it is actually deducted from a monthly benefit check. Therefore-

(1) The premium is "paid" even if SSA later finds that the benefit was paid in error; but

(2) A finding that a monthly benefit was erroneously withheld does not constitute payment of the premium for that month. Since there was no payment, there was no deduction. The enrollee is billed and continuance of coverage depends on payment of premiums before the end of the grace period or extended grace period.
