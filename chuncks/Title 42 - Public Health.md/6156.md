####### ยง 405.1046 Notice of an ALJ or attorney adjudicator decision.
######## Limitation on decision.

(3)When the amount of payment for an item or service is an issue before the ALJ or attorney adjudicator, the ALJ or attorney adjudicator may make a finding as to the amount of payment due. If the ALJ or attorney adjudicator makes a finding concerning payment when the amount of payment was not an issue before the ALJ or attorney adjudicator, the contractor may independently determine the payment amount. In either of the aforementioned situations, an ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision is not binding on the contractor for purposes of determining the amount of payment due. The amount of payment determined by the contractor in effectuating the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision is a new initial determination under ยง 405.924.
