####### Average bed occupancy.

(v)Has an average bed occupancy rate that is greater than the average bed occupancy rate in the State in which the hospital is located during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS, as of the date that the hospital submits its request, contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the requesting hospital's average bed occupancy rate and the relevant State's average bed occupancy rate. A hospital must use filed hospital cost report data to determine its average bed occupancy rate. CMS will provide on its Web site State average bed occupancy rates. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), "sufficient number" means the number of hospitals, as determined by CMS that would ensure that the determination under this paragraph (c)(2)(v) would not materially change after additional hospital data are reported.
