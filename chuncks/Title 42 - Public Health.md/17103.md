####### Gross base year Medicaid per capita expenditures

are equal to the expenditures, including dispensing fees, made by the State and reported in MSIS during calendar year 2003 for covered outpatient drugs, excluding drugs or classes of drugs, or their medical uses, which may be excluded from coverage or otherwise restricted under section 1860D-2 of the Act, other than smoking cessation agents determined per full-benefit dual eligible individual for the individuals not receiving medical assistance for the drugs through a comprehensive Medicaid managed care plan. This amount is determined based on MSIS drug claims paid during the four quarters of calendar year 2003 and the corresponding dual eligibility enrollment status of the beneficiary. MSIS drug claims having National Drug Codes determined by CMS to be in the Part D excluded drug class, and claims having a program type code indicating Indian Health Service or Family Planning will be excluded from the calculation.
