###### Recovery for failure to perform obligated service.

(g)(1) If an individual fails to begin or complete the obligated service in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, that individual is obligated to repay the United States an amount equal to three times the cost of the award (including stipends and other trainee allowances) plus interest on that amount calculated for the total period since the trainee failed to perform the obligated service at the rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury for National Research Service Awards prevailing on the date on which the period of appointment begins, multiplied, in any case in which the service that was required has been performed in part, by the percentage which the length of service that was not performed is to the length of the service that was required to be performed. The amount will be determined under the following formula:

(2) Unless the Secretary extends the repayment period as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the individual shall pay to the United States the total amount which the United States is entitled to recover under paragraph (g)(1) of this section immediately upon the date that the individual fails to begin or complete the period of obligated service (including failing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of an extension or break in service granted the individual) or upon the date that the individual indicates his or her intention not to fulfill the service obligation as determined by the Secretary. The amount is considered a debt owed to the United States, with interest accruing monthly upon the total debt as provided under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
