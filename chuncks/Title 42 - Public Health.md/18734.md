(C)() The ACO's performance year assigned beneficiary population identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is used to determine the MSR for Track 1 ACOs and the variable MSR/MLR for ACOs in a two-sided model that selected this option at the start of their agreement period. For two-sided model ACOs that selected a fixed MSR/MLR at the start of the ACO's agreement period, this fixed MSR/MLR is applied. In the event an ACO's performance year assigned population identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is below 5,000 beneficiaries, the MSR/MLR is determined according to ยง 425.110(b).
