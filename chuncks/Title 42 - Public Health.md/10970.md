####### Special rules for payment of care plan oversight provided by nonphysician practitioners for beneficiaries who receive HHA services covered by Medicare.

(c)(1) An NPP can furnish physician care plan oversight (but may not certify a patient as needing home health services) only if the physician who signs the plan of care provides regular ongoing care under the same plan of care as does the NPP billing for care plan oversight and either-

(i) The physician and NPP are part of the same group practice; or

(ii) If the NPP is a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist, the physician signing the plan of care also has a collaborative agreement with the NPP; or

(iii) If the NPP is a physician assistant, the physician signing the plan of care is also the physician who provides general supervision of physician assistant services for the practice.

(2) Payment may be made for care plan oversight services furnished by an NPP when:

(i) The NPP providing the care plan oversight has seen and examined the patient;

(ii) The NPP providing care plan oversight is not functioning as a consultant whose participation is limited to a single medical condition rather than multi-disciplinary coordination of care; and

(iii) The NPP providing care plan oversight integrates his or her care with that of the physician who signed the plan of care.
