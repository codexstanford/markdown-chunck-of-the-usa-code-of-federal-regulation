####### Third party payments and probate collections.

(b)The requirements of this subpart do not apply to-

(1) Cases involving third party liability because, in these situations, recovery is sought for a Medicaid payment that would have been made had another party not been legally responsible for payment; and

(2) Probate collections from the estates of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries, as they represent the recovery of payments properly made from resources later determined to be available to the State.
