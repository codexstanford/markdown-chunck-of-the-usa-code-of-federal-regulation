######## Good cause exceptions applicable to payment suspensions.

(b)(1) CMS may find that good cause exists not to suspend payments or not to continue to suspend payments to an individual or entity against which there are credible allegations of fraud if-

(i) OIG or other law enforcement agency has specifically requested that a payment suspension not be imposed because such a payment suspension may compromise or jeopardize an investigation;

(ii) It is determined that beneficiary access to items or services would be so jeopardized by a payment suspension in whole or part as to cause a danger to life or health;

(iii) It is determined that other available remedies implemented by CMS or a Medicare contractor more effectively or quickly protect Medicare funds than would implementing a payment suspension; or

(iv) CMS determines that a payment suspension or a continuation of a payment suspension is not in the best interests of the Medicare program.

(2) Every 180 days after the initiation of a suspension of payments based on credible allegations of fraud, CMS will-

(i) Evaluate whether there is good cause to not continue such suspension under this section; and

(ii) Request a certification from the OIG or other law enforcement agency that the matter continues to be under investigation warranting continuation of the suspension.

(3) Good cause not to continue to suspend payments to an individual or entity against which there are credible allegations of fraud must be deemed to exist if a payment suspension has been in effect for 18 months and there has not been a resolution of the investigation, except CMS may extend a payment suspension beyond that point if-

(i) The case has been referred to, and is being considered by, the OIG for administrative action (for example, civil money penalties); or such administrative action is pending or

(ii) The Department of Justice submits a written request to CMS that the suspension of payments be continued based on the ongoing investigation and anticipated filing of criminal or civil action or both or based on a pending criminal or civil action or both. At a minimum, the request must include the following:

(A) Identification of the entity under suspension.

(B) The amount of time needed for continued suspension in order to conclude the criminal or civil proceeding or both.

(C) A statement of why or how criminal or civil action or both may be affected if the requested extension is not granted.
