####### Reconciling the observation/interview findings with the record.

(i)Determine if:

- An assessment has been performed.

- A plan with goals has been developed.

- The interventions have been carried out.

- The resident has been evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the interventions.

For example, if a resident has developed a decubitus ulcer while in the facility, record review can validate staff and resident interviews regarding the facility's attempts at prevention. Use your own judgment; review as much of the record(s) as necessary to evaluate the care planning. Note that facilities need not establish specific areas in the record stating "Assessment," "Plan," "Intervention," or "Evaluation" in order for the documentation to be considered adequate.
