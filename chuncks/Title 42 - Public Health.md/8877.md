(viii) A hospital that began construction of its facility prior to August 5, 1997, and sponsored new medical residency training programs on or after January 1, 1995 and on or before August 5, 1997, that either received initial accreditation by the appropriate accrediting body or temporarily trained residents at another hospital(s) until the facility was completed, may receive an adjustment to its full-time equivalent cap in accordance with the provisions of § 413.79(g) of this subchapter.

(ix)(A) A hospital may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE resident cap to reflect displaced residents added because of another hospital's closure if the hospital meets the criteria specified in § 413.79(h)(1) and (2) of this subchapter. If a hospital that closes its residency training program agrees to temporarily reduce its FTE resident cap according to the criteria specified in § 413.79(h)(1) and (h)(3)(ii)of this subchapter, another hospital(s) may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE resident cap to reflect displaced residents added because of the closure of the residency training program if the criteria specified in § 413.79(h)(1) and (h)(3)(i) of this subchapter are met.

(B) A hospital may receive a permanent adjustment to its FTE resident cap as a result of slots that were redistributed from a closed hospital, as defined at § 413.79(h)(1)(i) of this subchapter, if the hospital meets the requirements at § 413.79(o) of this subchapter.

(x) (A) For rural track programs started in a cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2022, an urban hospital that establishes a new residency program (as defined in § 413.79(l) of this subchapter), or has an existing residency program, with a rural track (or an integrated rural track) may include in its FTE count residents in those rural tracks in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 413.79(k) of this subchapter.

(B) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2022, an urban hospital or rural hospital that establishes a new residency program (as defined in § 413.79(l) of this subchapter) that is a Rural Track Program (as defined at § 413.75(b) of this subchapter), or adds an additional site to a Rural Track Program, may include in its FTE count residents in the Rural Track Program in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 413.79(k) of this subchapter.

(xi) Effective for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning on or after November 29, 1999, a hospital may receive an adjustment to its FTE cap of up to three additional FTEs to the extent that the additional residents would have been counted as primary care residents for purposes of the hospital's FTE cap but for the fact that the additional residents were on maternity or disability leave or a similar approved leave of absence, in accordance with the provisions of § 413.79(i) of this subchapter.

(xii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, a non-Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect residents who had been previously trained at a VA hospital and were subsequently transferred to the non-VA hospital, if the hospital meets the criteria and other provisions of § 413.79(j) of this subchapter.

(xiii) For a hospital that was paid under part 413 of this chapter as a hospital excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and that subsequently becomes subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, the limit on the total number of FTE residents for payment purposes is determined based on the data from the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.

(xiv) In the case of a merger of a hospital that is excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and an acute care hospital subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, if the surviving hospital is a hospital subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and no hospital unit that is excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system is created as a result of the merger, the surviving hospital's number of FTE residents for payment purposes is equal to the sum of the FTE resident count of the hospital that is subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section and the limit on the total number of FTE residents for the excluded hospital as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(xiii) of this section.

(xv) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, an urban hospital that reclassifies to a rural area under § 412.103 for fewer than 10 continuous years and then subsequently elects to revert back to urban classification will not be allowed to retain the adjustment to its IME FTE resident cap that it received as a result of being reclassified as rural.

(2) To include a resident in the full-time equivalent count for a particular cost reporting period, the hospital must furnish the following information. The information must be certified by an official of the hospital and, if different, an official responsible for administering the residency program.

(i) A listing, by specialty, of all residents assigned to the hospital and providing services to the hospital during the cost reporting period.

(ii) The name and social security number of each resident.

(iii) The dates the resident is assigned to the hospital.
