(2) Payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under any other Federally operated or financed health insurance or benefits program, other than a program operated or financed by the Indian Health Service.

(3) Services are for an unborn child and are payable under Medicaid as a service to an eligible pregnant woman under that program.
