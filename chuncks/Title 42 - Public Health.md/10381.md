####### Treatment of residual assets following termination of a Funded Plan.

(8)(i) Residual assets arising from the termination of a funded Deferred Compensation Plan must be recouped in the year of the plan termination only against the cost center(s) in which the provider of services reported its plan contributions or payments, usually the administrative and general cost center.

(ii) Residual assets exceeding the amount in the administrative and general (or other) cost center are not further offset in the current or subsequent years.

(iii) The Medicare share of the reversion is based on the Medicare utilization rate in the year the reversion occurs (or the year the actuarial surplus is determined), and not Medicare's utilization in the years the contributions to the plan were made.
