####### Transition process and procedures.

(e)(1) For coverage effective January 1 of the next year, and subject to the disclosure requirements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an MA organization may transition enrollees in a plan specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section into another MA plan or plans (including into a dual eligible special needs plan for enrollees who are eligible for such a plan) offered by the MA organization, or another MA organization that shares the same parent organization as the MA organization, for which the individual is eligible in accordance with §§ 422.50 through 422.53 if the MA plan or plans receiving such enrollment-

(i) Would not meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, as determined in the procedures described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, with the addition of the newly enrolled individuals (unless such plan is a Specialized MA plan for Special Needs Individuals as defined in § 422.2);

(ii) Is an MA-PD plan described at § 422.2;

(iii) Has a combined Part C and Part D premium of $0.00 for individuals eligible for the premium subsidy for full subsidy eligible individuals described in § 423.780(a) of this chapter; and

(iv) Is of the same plan type (for example, HMO or PPO) as the plan specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) An MA organization may transition individuals under paragraph (e)(1) of this section without requiring the individual to file the election form under § 422.66(a) if-

(i) The enrolled individual is eligible to enroll in the MA plan; and

(ii) The MA-PD plan into which individuals are transitioned describes changes to MA-PD benefits and provides information about the MA-PD plan in the Annual Notice of Change, which must be sent consistent with § 422.111(a), (d), and (e).

(3) For the purpose of approving a MA organization to transition enrollment under this paragraph (e), CMS determines whether a non-SNP MA plan would meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section by adding the cohort of individuals identified by the MA organization for enrollment in a non-SNP MA plan to the April enrollment of such plan and calculating the resulting percentage of dual eligible enrollment.

(4) In cases where an MA organization does not transition current enrollees under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the MA organization must send a written notice to enrollees who are not transitioned, consistent with § 422.506(a)(2).
