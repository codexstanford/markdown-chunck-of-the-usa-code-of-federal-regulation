(2)The Board's specific findings of fact and conclusions of law (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must not be invoked or relied on by the Board as a basis to deny, or decline to exercise, jurisdiction over a specific item or take any other of the actions specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Upon giving the parties to the appeal the Board's written specific factual findings and legal conclusions (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section) on the question of whether the provider's cost report included an appropriate cost report claim for the specific item under appeal, the Board must proceed to issue one of the four types of overall decisions specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section with respect to the specific item. If the Board issues either of two types of overall Board decisions (as specified in paragraph (d) of this section) regarding the specific item under appeal, the Board's written specific factual findings and legal conclusions (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must be included in such overall Board decision regarding the specific item, along with the other matters that are required by the regulations for the pertinent type of overall Board decision. However, if the Board issues either of two other types of overall Board decisions (as specified in paragraph (e) of this section) regarding the specific item under appeal, the Board's written specific factual findings and legal conclusions (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must not be included in the overall Board decision regarding the specific item. The Board may permit reimbursement for the specific item under appeal, as part of one of the two types of overall Board decisions that are specified in paragraph (d) of this section, but such reimbursement may be permitted only to the extent authorized by paragraph (f) of this section.
