###### QIO Review Functions
####### ยง 476.120 Submission of written beneficiary complaints.
######## New concerns raised by a Medicare beneficiary.

(b)If a Medicare beneficiary raises new concerns relating to the same complaint after the completion of the interim initial determination in ยง 476.130(c), the concerns will be processed as a new complaint. The QIO may process new concerns raised after the receipt of the written complaint as part of the same complaint, provided they are received prior to the completion of the interim initial determination. Even if a concern is received before the interim initial determination, the QIO can address it as a separate complaint if the QIO determines that this is warranted by the circumstances.
