####### ยง 405.1036 Description of an ALJ hearing process.
######## Waiver of the right to appear.

(b)(1) A party may submit to OMHA a written statement indicating that he or she does not wish to appear at the hearing.

(2) The appellant may subsequently withdraw his or her waiver at any time before the notice of the hearing decision is issued; however, by withdrawing the waiver the appellant agrees to an extension of the adjudication period as specified in ยง 405.1016 that may be necessary to schedule and hold the hearing.

(3) Other parties may withdraw their waiver up to the date of the scheduled hearing, if any. Even if all of the parties waive their right to appear at a hearing, the ALJ may require them to attend an oral hearing if he or she believes that a personal appearance and testimony by the appellant or any other party is necessary to decide the case.
