###### ยง 412.64 Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for Federal fiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years.
####### Adjusting for different area wage levels.

(h)CMS adjusts the proportion of the Federal rate for inpatient operating costs that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs. The adjustment described in this paragraph (h) also takes into account the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category.

(1) The wage index is updated annually.

(2) CMS determines the proportion of the Federal rate that is attributable to wages and labor-related costs from time to time, employing a methodology that is described in the annual regulation updating the system of payment for inpatient hospital operating costs.

(3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS employs 62 percent as the proportion of the rate that is adjusted for the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs, unless employing that percentage would result in lower payments for the hospital than employing the proportion determined under the methodology described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

(4) For discharges on or after October 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2018, and for discharges on or after October 1, 2021, CMS establishes a minimum wage index for each all-urban State, as defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this section. This minimum wage index value is computed using the following methodology:

(i) CMS computes the ratio of the lowest-to-highest wage index for each all-urban State;

(ii) CMS computes the average of the ratios of the lowest-to-highest wage indexes of all the all-urban States;

(iii) For each all-urban State, CMS determines the higher of the State's own lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) or the average lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section);

(iv) For each State, CMS multiplies the rate determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section by the highest wage index value in the State;

(v) The product determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section is the minimum wage index value for the State, except as provided under paragraph (h)(4)(vi) of this section;

(vi) For discharges on or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2018, and for discharges on or after October 1, 2021, the minimum wage index value for the State is the higher of the value determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section or the value computed using the following alternative methodology:

(A) CMS estimates a percentage representing the average percentage increase in wage index for hospitals receiving the rural floor due to such floor.

(B) For each all-urban State, CMS makes a onetime determination of the lowest hospital wage index in the State (including all adjustments to the hospital's wage index, except for the rural floor, the rural floor budget neutrality, and the outmigration adjustment) and increases this wage index by the percentage determined under paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(A) of this section, the result of which establishes the alternative minimum wage index value for the State.

(vii) For discharges on or after October 1, 2021, the minimum wage index computed under this paragraph must not be applied in a budget neutral manner.

(5)(i) For purposes of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, for discharges on or after October 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2018, an all-urban State is a State with no rural areas, as defined in this section, or a State in which there are no hospitals classified as rural. For purposes of this definition, a State with rural areas and with hospitals reclassified as rural under ยง 412.103 is not an all-urban State.

(ii) For purposes of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, for discharges on or after October 1, 2021, an all-urban State is a State with no rural areas, as defined in this section, or a State in which there are no hospitals classified as rural under section 1886 of the Act. For purposes of this definition, a hospital is classified as rural under section 1886 of the Act if it is assigned the State's rural area wage index value.

(6) If a new rural hospital that is subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system opens in a State that has an imputed rural floor and has rural areas, CMS uses the imputed floor as the hospital's wage index until the hospital's first cost report as an inpatient prospective payment system provider is contemporaneous with the cost reporting period being used to develop a given fiscal year's wage index.

(7) Beginning with fiscal year 2023, if CMS determines that a hospital's wage index value for a fiscal year would decrease by more than 5 percent as compared to the hospital's wage index value for the prior fiscal year, CMS limits the decrease to 5 percent for the fiscal year.
