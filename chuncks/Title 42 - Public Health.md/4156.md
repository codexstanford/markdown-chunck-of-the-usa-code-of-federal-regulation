###### ยง 110.90 Reconsideration of the Secretary's eligibility and benefits determinations.
####### Reconsideration process.

(c)When the Associate Administrator of the Healthcare Systems Bureau (the Associate Administrator), receives a request for reconsideration, a qualified panel, independent of the Program, will be convened to review the Secretary's determination. The panel will base its recommendation on the documentation before the Secretary when the determination was made. The panel will perform its own review and make its own findings, which will be submitted to the Associate Administrator. The Associate Administrator will then review the panel's recommendation(s) and make a final determination, which will be sent to the requester (or his or her representative). This will be the Secretary's final action on the request for reconsideration and will be considered the Secretary's final determination on the request for Program benefits with regard to the injury that is the subject of that Request Package. Requesters may not seek review of a decision made on reconsideration.
