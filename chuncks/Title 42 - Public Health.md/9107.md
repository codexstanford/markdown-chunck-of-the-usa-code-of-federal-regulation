######## Calculate measure group scores.

(4)A score is calculated for each measure group for which a hospital has measure data using a simple average of measure scores, as follows:

(i) Each measure group score is standardized by calculating Z-scores for each measure group so that all measure group scores are centered near zero with a standard deviation of one.

(ii) We take 100 percent divided by the number of measures reported in a measure group to determine the percentage of each measure's weight.

(iii) The measure weight is then multiplied by the standardized measure score to calculate the measure's weighted score.

(iv) Then, all of the individual measure weighted scores within a measure group are added together to calculate the measure group score.
