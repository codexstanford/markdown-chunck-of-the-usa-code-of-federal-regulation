###### ยง 483.136 Evaluating whether an individual with intellectual disability requires specialized services (PASARR/IID).
####### Data interpretation

(c)-(1) The State must ensure that a licensed psychologist identifies the intellectual functioning measurement of individuals with IID or a related condition.

(2) Based on the data compiled in paragraph (b) of this section, the State intellectual disability authority, using appropriate personnel, as designated by the State, must validate that the individual has IID or is a person with a related condition and must determine whether specialized services for intellectual disability are needed. In making this determination, the State intellectual disability authority must make a qualitative judgment on the extent to which the person's status reflects, singly and collectively, the characteristics commonly associated with the need for specialized services, including-

(i) Inability to-

(A) Take care of the most personal care needs;

(B) Understand simple commands;

(C) Communicate basic needs and wants;

(D) Be employed at a productive wage level without systematic long term supervision or support;

(E) Learn new skills without aggressive and consistent training;

(F) Apply skills learned in a training situation to other environments or settings without aggressive and consistent training;

(G) Demonstrate behavior appropriate to the time, situation or place without direct supervision; and

(H) Make decisions requiring informed consent without extreme difficulty;

(ii) Demonstration of severe maladaptive behavior(s) that place the person or others in jeopardy to health and safety; and

(iii) Presence of other skill deficits or specialized training needs that necessitate the availability of trained IID personnel, 24 hours per day, to teach the person functional skills.
