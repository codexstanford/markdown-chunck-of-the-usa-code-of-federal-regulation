(c)For 2007 to 2014, with respect to covered professional services furnished during a reporting period by an eligible professional, an eligible professional (or in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, a group practice) may receive an incentive if-

(1) There are any quality measures that have been established under the PQRS that are applicable to any such services furnished by such professional (or in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, such group practice) for such reporting period; and

(2) If the eligible professional (or in the case of a group practice under paragraph (j) of this section, the group practice) satisfactorily submits (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section for the eligible professional and paragraph (i) of this section for the group practice) to the Secretary data on such quality measures in accordance with the PQRS for such reporting period, in addition to the amount otherwise paid under section 1848 of the Act, there also must be paid to the eligible professional (or to an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1842(b)(6)(A) of the Act or, in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, to the group practice) from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund established under section 1841 of the Act an amount equal to the applicable quality percent (as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) of the eligible professional's (or, in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, the group practice's) total estimated allowed charges for all covered professional services furnished by the eligible professional (or, in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, by the group practice) during the reporting period.

(3) The applicable quality percent is as follows:

(i) For 2007 and 2008, 1.5 percent.

(ii) For 2009 and 2010, 2.0 percent.

(iii) For 2011, 1.0 percent.

(iv) For 2012, 2013, and 2014, 0.5 percent.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (c)-

(i) The eligible professional's (or, in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, the group practice's) total estimated allowed charges for covered professional services furnished during a reporting period are determined based on claims processed in the National Claims History (NCH) no later than 2 months after the end of the applicable reporting period;

(ii) In the case of the eligible professional who furnishes covered professional services in more than one practice, incentive payments are separately determined for each practice based on claims submitted for the eligible professional for each practice;

(iii) Incentive payments to a group practice under this paragraph must be in lieu of the payments that would otherwise be made under the PQRS to eligible professionals in the group practice for meeting the criteria for satisfactory reporting for individual eligible professionals. For any program year in which the group practice (as identified by the TIN) is selected to participate in the PQRS group practice reporting option, the eligible professional cannot individually qualify for a PQRS incentive payment by meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

(iv) Incentive payments earned by the eligible professional (or in the case of a group practice under paragraph (i) of this section, by the group practice) for a particular program year will be paid as a single consolidated payment to the TIN holder of record.

(5) The Secretary must treat an individual eligible professional, as identified by a unique TIN/NPI combination, as satisfactorily submitting data on quality measures (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section), if the eligible professional is satisfactorily participating (as determined under paragraph (h) of this section), in a qualified clinical data registry.
