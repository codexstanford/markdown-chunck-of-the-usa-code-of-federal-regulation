###### ยง 421.122 Performance standards.
####### Publication of standards.

(c)The development and revision of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October 1-September 30, CMS publishes the performance standards as part of thenotice describing the performance criteria issued under ยง 421.120(c). CMS may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. CMS interprets the statutory phrase "before the beginning of each evaluation period" as allowing publication of the criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new criteria and standards begins after the publication of the notice.
