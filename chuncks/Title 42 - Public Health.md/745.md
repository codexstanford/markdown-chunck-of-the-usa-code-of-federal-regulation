Subcontractors are subjected to the same provisions. Failure to comply with the standards set forth in this part, or to correct deficiencies noted within the allowable time period, could result in termination of the contract by the Federal Government (HHS/NIH), or allow the Secretary to correct the deficiencies according to the terms and conditions outlined in the contract. The Secretary may impose additional sanctions on the contractor up to, and including, authorizing assumption or reassignment of the management of the sanctuary contract.
