(5). If the provider files an administrative appeal (pursuant to Part 405, Subpart R of this chapter) seeking reimbursement for a specific item and any party to such appeal questions whether the provider's cost report included an appropriate claim for the specific item under appeal (as specified in paragraphs (j)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section), the reviewing entity (as defined in § 405.1801(a) of this chapter) must follow the procedures prescribed in § 405.1873 of this chapter (if the appeal was filed originally with the Board), or the procedures set forth in § 405.1832 of this chapter (if the appeal was filed initially with the contractor), for review of whether the substantive reimbursement requirement of an appropriate cost report claim for the specific item under appeal is satisfied. The reviewing entity must follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (j)(3) of this section in determining whether the provider's cost report included an appropriate claim for the specific item under appeal. The reviewing entity may permit reimbursement for the specific item under appeal solely to the extent authorized by § 405.1873(f) of this chapter (if the appeal was filed originally with the Board) or by § 405.1832(f) of this chapter (if the appeal was filed initially with the contractor).
