####### Example.

(b)F is the wife of J who is a retiree of Corporation X. That corporation pays premiums on behalf of all of its retirees and their dependents. F obtains a divorce from J on October 20 and thus disqualifies herself for further premium payments by the corporation. The corporation gives notice on November 10 that a refund is due because F has been dropped from the list of persons for whom it has agreed to pay premiums. The premium paid for December would be refunded to the group payer.
