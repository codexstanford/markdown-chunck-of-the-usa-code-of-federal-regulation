()For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2011, an IRF may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect displaced residents added because of the closure of another IRF's residency training program if the IRF is training additional displaced residents from the residency training program of an IRF that closed a program; and if no later than 60 days after the IRF begins to train the displaced residents the IRF submits to its Medicare Contractor a request for a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap, documents that it is eligible for this temporary adjustment by identifying the displaced residents who have come from another IRF's closed program and have caused the IRF to exceed its cap, specifies the length of time the adjustment is needed, and submits to its Medicare Contractor a copy of the FTE reduction statement by the hospital that closed its program, as specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A)() of this section.
