####### Process for determining a nonhospital-based EP.

(b)When an EP registers for a given payment year they should receive a determination of whether they have been determined "hospital-based."

(1) An EP determined "hospital-based," but who wishes to be determined nonhospital-based as specified in paragraph (a) of section, may use an administrative process to provide documentation and seek a nonhospital-based determination. Such administrative process will be available throughout the incentive payment year and including the 2 months following the incentive payment year in which the EP may attest to being a meaningful EHR user.

(2) If an EP is determined nonhospital-based under paragraph (a) of this section, to be considered nonhospital-based for subsequent payment years, the EP must attest in such payment year (or by the time the EP must attest it is a meaningful EHR user for such year) that the EP continues to meet the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.
