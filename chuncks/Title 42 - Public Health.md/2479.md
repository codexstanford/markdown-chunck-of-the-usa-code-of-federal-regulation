####### Reasonable educational and living expenses

means those educational and living expenses which are equal to or less than the sum of the school's estimated standard student budgets for educational and living expenses for the degree program and for the year(s) during which the Program participant is/was enrolled in the school. However, if the school attended by the Program participant does/did not have a standard student budget or if a Program participant requests repayment for educational and living expenses which are in excess of the standard student budgets described in the preceding sentence, the Program participant must submit documentation, as required by the Secretary, to substantiate the reasonableness of all educational and living expenses incurred by the Program participant. To the extent that the Secretary determines, upon review of the Program participant's documentation, that all or a portion of the educational and living expenses are reasonable, these expenses will qualify for repayment.
