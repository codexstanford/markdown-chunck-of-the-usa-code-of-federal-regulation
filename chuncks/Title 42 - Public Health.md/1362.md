(1)Testing personnel must fully comply with the 2005 ATS/ERS Standardisation of Spirometry guidelines for instrument calibration check procedures, pp. 322-323, including Table 3 (incorporated by reference,ยง 37.98).

(i) For volume spirometers, calibration check procedures must include daily (day of testing) leak and volume accuracy checks. In addition, volume linearity checks must be performed according to the frequency established by the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines.

(ii) For flow-type spirometers, calibration must be checked daily by injecting 3 liters of air from a calibration syringe at 3 different speeds (fast, medium, slow). Flow linearity must be checked weekly as established by the 2005 ATS/ERS guidelines.

(iii) Instrument calibration check records must be maintained by the facility and available for inspection by NIOSH, as deemed necessary.
