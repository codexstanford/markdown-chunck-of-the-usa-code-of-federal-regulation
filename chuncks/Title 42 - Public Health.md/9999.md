####### Amount due.

(2)Section 1878(f) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395oo(f), authorizes a court to award interest in favor of the prevailing party on any amount due as a result of the court's decision. If the contractor withheld any portion of the amount in controversy prior to the date the provider seeks judicial review by a Federal court, and the Medicare program is the prevailing party, interest is payable by the provider only on the amount not withheld. Similarly, if the Medicare program seeks to recover amounts previously paid to a provider, and the provider is the prevailing party, interest on the amounts previously paid to a provider is not payable by the Medicare program since that amount had been paid and is not due the provider.
