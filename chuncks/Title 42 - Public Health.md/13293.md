(4)If the HMO or CMP does not have adequate data to adjust the initial rate calculated under paragraph (b) of this section to reflect the utilization characteristics of its Medicare enrollees, CMS will, at the HMO's or CMP's request, adjust the initial rate. CMS adjusts the rate on the basis of differences in the utilization characteristics of-

(i) Medicare and non-Medicare enrollees in other HMOs or CMPs; or

(ii) Medicare beneficiaries (in the HMO's or CMP's area, or State, or the United States) who are eligible to enroll in an HMO or CMP and other individuals in that same area, or State, or the United States.
