###### § 414.1445 Determination of other payer advanced APMs.
####### Information required for Other Payer Advanced APM determinations.

(c)(1) In order to make an Other Payer Advanced APM determination as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a payer, APM Entity, or eligible clinician must submit the information specified by CMS in a form and manner specified by CMS. If a payer, APM Entity, or eligible clinician fails to submit the information required, CMS will not make a determination as to whether a payment arrangement meets the Other Payer Advanced APM criteria as set forth in § 414.1420.

(2) If an eligible clinician submits information showing that a payment arrangement requires that the eligible clinician must use CEHRT as defined in § 414.1305 to document and communicate clinical care, CMS will presume that the CEHRT criterion in § 414.1420(b) is satisfied for that payment arrangement.

(i) Based on the submission by an eligible clinician or payer of evidence that CMS determines sufficiently demonstrates that CEHRT is used as specified in § 414.1420(b) by participants in the payment arrangement, CMS will consider the CEHRT criterion in § 414.1420(b) is satisfied for that payment arrangement.

(ii) [Reserved]

(3) If a payment arrangement has no outcome measure, the payer, APM Entity, or eligible clinician requesting a determination of whether a payment arrangement meets the Other Payer Advanced APM criteria must certify that there is no available or applicable outcome measure on the MIPS measure list.
