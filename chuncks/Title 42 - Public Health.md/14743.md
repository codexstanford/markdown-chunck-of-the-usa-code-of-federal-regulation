####### Computation of savings for MA regional plans.

(d)The average per capita monthly savings for an MA regional plan and year is 100 percent of the difference between the plan's risk-adjusted statutory non-drug monthly bid amount (described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and the plan's risk-adjusted region-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount (described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), using the risk adjustment factors described in paragraph (e) of this section. Plans with bids equal to or greater than plan benchmarks will have zero savings.
