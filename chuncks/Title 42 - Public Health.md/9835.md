####### More sophisticated methods.

(ii)A more sophisticated method designed to allocate costs more accurately may be used by the provider upon approval of the contractor. However, having elected to use the double-apportionment method, the provider may not thereafter use the step-down method without approval of the contractor. Written request for the approval must be made on a prospective basis and must be submitted before the end of the fourth month of the prospective reporting period. Likewise, once having elected to use a more sophisticated method, the provider may not thereafter use either the double-apportionment or step-down methods without similar request and approval.
