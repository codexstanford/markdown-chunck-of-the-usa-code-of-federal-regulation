####### CMS determination.

(4)CMS determines, within 120 days of receiving all necessary information from the intermediary, whether an increase in the hospital-specific rate is warranted and, if it is, the amount of the increase. CMS grants an adjustment only if a hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge exceed the hospital's hospital-specific rate. The adjusted hospital-specific rate cannot exceed the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge for the cost reporting period.
