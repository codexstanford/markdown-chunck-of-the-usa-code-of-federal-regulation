(2) Although the methodology established by HHS under this Part is binding on DOL, DOL may determine that arguments concerning theof this methodology should be considered by NIOSH.

(b) NIOSH may review completed dose reconstructions on its own initiative and with the assistance of DOL to identify denied claims when either of the following circumstances arise:

(1) NIOSH obtains records or information on radiation exposures of DOE or AWE employees that could substantially increase the level of radiation doses estimated in the completed dose reconstructions; or

(2) NIOSH changes a scientific element underlying dose reconstructions according to the provisions of Subpart E of this rule and the change could substantially increase the level of radiation doses estimated in the completed dose reconstructions.

(c) When NIOSH completes the review of a dose reconstruction, NIOSH will provide a report describing the basis for the review, the methods employed in the review, and the review findings to the claimant, DOL, and DOE.
