####### Calculation of facility-specific rate for the first cost reporting period.

(b)The facility-specific rate is computed based on the SNF's Medicare allowable costs from its fiscal year 1995 cost report plus an estimate of the amounts payable under Part B for covered SNF services (other than those services described in § 411.15(p)(2) of this chapter) furnished during fiscal year 1995 to individuals who were residents of SNFs and receiving Part A covered services. Allowable costs associated with exceptions, as described in § 413.30(f), are included in the calculation of the facility-specific rate. Allowable costs associated with exemptions, as described in § 413.30(e)(2), are included in the calculation of the facility-specific rate but only to the extent that they do not exceed 150 percent of the routine cost limit. Low Medicare volume SNFs that were paid a prospectively determined rate under § 413.300 for their cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1995 will utilize that rate as the basis for the allowable costs of routine (operating and capital-related) expenses in determining the facility-specific rate. Each SNF's allowable costs are updated to the first cost reporting period to which the payment rates apply using annual factors equal to the SNF market basket percentage minus 1 percentage point.
