####### Subgroups.

(ii)For an MVP Participant that is a subgroup, any reweighting applied to its affiliated group will also be applied to the subgroup. In addition, if reweighting is not applied to the affiliated group, the subgroup may receive reweighting in the following circumstances independent of the affiliated group:

(A) A subgroup may submit an application to CMS demonstrating that it was subject to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances and receive reweighting in accordance with ยง 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(6) and (c)(2)(i)(C)(2). In the event that a subgroup submits data for a performance category, the scoring weight described at ยง 414.1380(c)(1) would be applied and its weight would not be redistributed.

(B) A subgroup will receive reweighting if CMS determines, based on information known to the agency prior to the beginning of the relevant MIPS payment year, that data for the subgroup are inaccurate, unusable or otherwise compromised due to circumstances outside of the control of the subgroup and its agents, in accordance with ยง 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(9) and (c)(2)(i)(C)(10).
