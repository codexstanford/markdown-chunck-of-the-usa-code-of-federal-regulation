() The acquisition cost to the owner of record is subject to the limitation on historical costs described in paragraphs (g) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, and is reduced by any depreciation taken by the owner of record. The limitation on historical cost is also applied to the purchase of land, which is a capital asset that is neither depreciable nor amortizable under any circumstances. (See §§ 413.153(d) and 413.157(b) for application of the limitation to the cost of land for purposes of determining the allowable interest expense.)
