####### Exceptions,Base period for certain hospitals.

(e)-(1)If a hospital did not have any approved medical residency training programs or did not participate in Medicare during the base period, but either condition changes in a cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1985, the contractor establishes a per resident amount for the hospital using the information from the first cost reporting period during which the hospital participates in Medicare and the residents are on duty during the first month of that period. Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2006, if a hospital did not have any approved medical residency training programs or did not participate in Medicare during the base period, but either condition changes in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2006, and the residents are not on duty during the first month of that period, the contractor establishes a per resident amount for the hospital using the information from the first cost reporting period immediately following the cost reporting period during which the hospital participates in Medicare and residents began training at the hospital. The per resident amount is based on the lower of the amount specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Any GME costs incurred by the hospital during the cost reporting period prior to the base period used for calculating the PRA are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis.

(i) The hospital's actual cost per resident incurred in connection with the GME program(s) based on the cost and resident data from the hospital's base year cost reporting period as established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(ii) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)of this section-

(A) For base periods that begin before October 1, 2002, the updated weighted mean value of per resident amounts of all hospitals located in the same geographic wage area, as that term is used in the prospective payment system under Part 412 of this chapter.

(B) For base periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, the updated weighted mean value of per resident amounts of all hospitals located in the same geographic wage area is calculated using all per resident amounts (including primary care and obstetrics and gynecology and nonprimary care) and FTE resident counts from the most recently settled cost reports of those teaching hospitals.

(iii) If, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) or (e)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, there are fewer than three existing teaching hospitals with per resident amounts that can be used to calculate the weighted mean value per resident amount, for base periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the per resident amount equals the updated weighted mean value of per resident amounts of all hospitals located in the same census region as that term is used in subpart D of part 412 of this subchapter.

(iv) A hospital that, as of December 27, 2020, has a per resident amount based on less than 1.0 FTE in any cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1997, may choose to receive a recalculated per resident amount either when it trains at least 1.0 FTE in the earliest cost reporting period beginning on or after December 27, 2020, and before December 26, 2025, or when it trains at least 1.0 FTE in the first cost reporting period beginning after December 27, 2021. A hospital that, as of December 27, 2020, has a per resident amount based on no more than 3.0 FTEs in any cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and before December 27, 2020, may choose to receive a recalculated per resident amount either when it trains more than 3.0 FTEs in the earliest cost reporting period beginning on or after December 27, 2020 and before December 26, 2025, or when it trains more than 3.0 FTE in the first cost reporting period beginning after December 27, 2021. In either case, residents need not be on duty during the first month of the cost reporting period. The recalculated per resident amount is based on the lower of-

(A) The hospital's actual cost per resident incurred in connection with the GME program(s) based on the cost and resident data from the hospital's base year cost reporting period, which is, for hospitals with a per resident amount previously based on less than 1.0 FTE, either when it trains at least 1.0 FTE in the earliest cost reporting period beginning on or after December 27, 2020, and before December 26, 2025, or when it trains at least 1.0 FTE in the first cost reporting period beginning after December 27, 2021; and for hospitals with a per resident amount previously based on not more than 3.0 FTEs, either when it trains more than 3.0 FTEs in the earliest cost reporting period beginning on or after December 27, 2020 and before December 26, 2025, or when it trains more than 3.0 FTE in the first cost reporting period beginning or after December 27, 2021; or

(B) The updated weighted mean value of per resident amounts of all hospitals located in the same geographic wage area is calculated using all per resident amounts (including primary care and obstetrics and gynecology and nonprimary care) and FTE resident counts from the most recently settled cost reports of those teaching hospitals.

(v) Effective for a cost reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2020, a per resident amount must be established if a hospital trains less than 1.0 FTE resident and this training results from the hospital's participation in a Medicare GME affiliation agreement under ยง 413.79(f). Effective for a cost reporting period beginning on or after December 27, 2020, a per resident amount must only be established when the hospital trains at least 1.0 FTE and does not participate in a Medicare GME affiliation agreement under ยง 413.79(f) for that training. Residents need not be on duty during the first month of the cost reporting period from which the per resident amount is established.
