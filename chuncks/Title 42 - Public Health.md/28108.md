######## Incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount.

(5)If the total incorrect episode payment amount represents money owed by the RO participant to CMS, CMS subtracts the total incorrect episode payment amount from the total incorrect payment withhold amount.

The resulting amount is the RO participant's incorrect episode payment reconciliation amount.
