######## Disposition of funds recouped.

(g)(1) If the Medicare contractor recouped funds before a timely and valid request for a redetermination was received, the amount recouped may be retained and applied first to accrued interest and then to reduce or eliminate the principal balance of the overpayment subject to the following:

(i) If the redetermination results in a reversal, the amount recouped may be applied to any other debt, including interest, owed by the provider or supplier before any excess is released to the provider.

(ii) If the redetermination results in a partial reversal and the decision reduces the overpayment plus assessed interest below the amount already recouped, the excess may be applied to any other debt, including interest, owed by the provider or supplier before any excess is released to the provider or supplier.

(iii) If the redetermination results in an affirmation and the provider or supplier subsequently requests a reconsideration, the Medicare contractor may retain the amount recouped and apply the funds first to accrued interest and then to outstanding principal pending action by the QIC on the reconsideration request.

(2) If the Medicare contractor also recouped funds in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the amount recouped may be retained by the Medicare contractor and applied first to accrued interest and then to reduce or eliminate the outstanding principal balance pending action by the QIC on the reconsideration request.

(3) If the action by the QIC is a dismissal, receipt of a withdrawal, a notice that the reconsideration is being escalated to an ALJ, or a reconsideration which affirms in whole the overpayment determination, including the redetermination, in question, the amount recouped is applied to interest first, then to reduce the outstanding principal balance and recoupment may be resumed as provided under paragraph (f) of this section.

(4) If the action by the QIC is a reconsideration, which reverses in whole the overpayment determination, including the redetermination, in question, the amount recouped may be applied to any other debt, including interest, owed by the provider or supplier to CMS or to HHS before any excess is released to the provider or supplier.

(5) If the action by the QIC is a reconsideration which results in a partial reversal and the decision reduces the overpayment plus assessed interest below the amount already recouped, the excess may be applied to any other debt, including interest, owed by the provider or supplier to CMS or to HHS before any excess is released to the provider or supplier.
