####### Individual income-based determination.

(3)The individual income-based determination shall be a comparison of the individual's MAGI-based income to the income standard in effect on December 1, 2009, as converted to an equivalent MAGI-based income standard for each applicable eligibility category as in effect on that date, as follows.

(i) The amount of an individual's income under the threshold methodology is the MAGI-based income determined in accordance with ยง 435.603 of this chapter.

(ii) For each individual, the equivalent MAGI-based income eligibility standard is the applicable income eligibility standard for the applicable category of eligibility as in effect on December 1, 2009 that is converted to an equivalent MAGI-based income standard. For example, as applicable, a separate MAGI-based income standard will be applied for individuals determined to be disabled who would have been eligible under an optional eligibility category in effect on December 1, 2009 that was based on disability. For these purposes, the applicable equivalent MAGI-based standard is the standard as submitted by the State and approved by CMS in accordance with CMS guidance.

(iii) With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the individual's MAGI-based income is at or below the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or group, then the individual is included in the population that is not newly eligible;

(iv) With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the individual's MAGI-based income is greater than the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or group, then the individual is included in the population that is newly eligible;
