####### Presumptions.

(c)(1) For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary was an inpatient of a SNF under paragraph (b)(2) of this section-

(i) A beneficiary's care met the skilled level of care requirements if inpatient SNF claims were paid for those services under Medicare or Medicaid, unless:

(A) Such payments were made under § 411.400 or Medicaid administratively necessary days provisions which result in payment for care not meeting the skilled level of care requirements, or

(B) A Medicare denial and a Medicaid payment are made for the same period, in which case the presumption in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies;

(ii) A beneficiary's care met the skilled level of care requirements if a SNF claim was paid under section 1879(e) of the Social Security Act;

(iii) A beneficiary's care did not meet the skilled level of care requirements if a SNF claim was paid for the services under § 411.400;

(iv) A beneficiary's care did not meet the skilled level of care requirements if a Medicaid SNF claim was denied on the grounds that the services were not at the skilled level of care (even if paid under applicable Medicaid administratively necessary days provisions which result in payment for care not meeting the skilled level of care requirements);

(2) For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary was an inpatient of a SNF under paragraph (b)(2) of this section a beneficiary's care in a SNF is presumed-

(i) To have met the skilled level of care requirements during any period for which the beneficiary was assigned to one of the Resource Utilization Groups designated as representing the required level of care, as provided in § 409.30.

(ii) To have met the skilled level of care requirements if a Medicaid or Medicare claim was denied on grounds other than that the services were not at the skilled level of care;

(iii) Not to have met the skilled level of care requirements if a Medicare SNF claim was denied on the grounds that the services were not at the skilled level of care and payment was not made under § 411.400; or

(iv) Not to have met the skilled level of care requirements if no Medicare or Medicaid claim was submitted by the SNF.

(3) If information upon which to base a presumption is not readily available, the intermediary may, at its discretion review the beneficiary's medical records to determine whether he or she was an inpatient of a SNF as set forth under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(4) When the intermediary makes a benefit period determination based upon paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the beneficiary may seek to reverse the benefit period determination by timely appealing the prior Medicare SNF claim determination under part 405, subpart G of this chapter, or the prior Medicaid SNF claim under part 431, subpart E of this chapter.

(5) When the intermediary makes a benefit period determination under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the beneficiary will be notified of the basis for the determination, and of his or her right to present evidence to rebut the determination that the skilled level of care requirements specified in § 409.31 (b)(1) and (b)(3) were or were not met on reconsideration and appeal under 42 CFR, part 405, subpart G of this chapter.
