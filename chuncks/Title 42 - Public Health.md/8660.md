(B) The hospital knew about the error in its wage data and requested the fiscal intermediary and CMS to correct the error both within the established schedule for requesting corrections to the wage data (which is at least before the beginning of the fiscal year for the applicable update to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system) and using the established process; and

(C) CMS agreed before October 1 that the fiscal intermediary or CMS made an error in tabulating the hospital's wage data and the wage index should be corrected.
