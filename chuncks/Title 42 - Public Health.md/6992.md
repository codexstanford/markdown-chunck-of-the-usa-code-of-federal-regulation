####### Special situations.

(2)(i) If the monthly social security benefit or age 72 special benefit is less than the monthly premium, the benefit is withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the balance through direct remittance. (This situation may arise if the individual first becomes eligible for social security benefits after December 31, 1981, and is, therefore, not eligible for the fixed minimum, or receives age 72 special benefits that are reduced because the individual receives a government pension.)

(ii) If the monthly railroad retirement benefit or civil service annuity payment is less than the premium, the monthly payment is not withheld and the enrollee is required to pay the total premium by direct remittance.
