######## Total incomplete episode amount.

(3)For incomplete episodes initiated in the PY, CMS determines the total incomplete episode amount by calculating the difference between the following amounts:

(i) The sum of all FFS amounts that would have been paid to the RO participant in the absence of the RO Model for any included RT services furnished during such incomplete episodes, as determined by no-pay claims. CMS owes this sum to the RO participant for such incomplete episodes.

(ii) The sum of the participant-specific episode payment amounts paid to the RO participant for such incomplete episodes initiated in the PY.
