###### § 422.266 Beneficiary rebates.
####### Calculation of rebate.

(a)(1) For 2006 through 2011, an MA organization must provide to the enrollee a monthly rebate equal to 75 percent of the average per capita savings (if any) described in § 422.264(b) for MA local plans and § 422.264(d) for MA regional plans.

(2) For 2012 and subsequent years, an MA organization must provide to the enrollee a monthly rebate equal to a specified percentage of the average per capita savings (if any) at § 422.264(b) for MA local plans and § 422.264(d) for MA regional plans. For 2012 and 2013, this percentage is based on a combination of the (a)(1) rule of 75 percent and the (a)(2)(ii) rules that set the percentage based on the plan's quality rating under a 5 star rating system, as determined by the Secretary under § 422.258(d)(7). For 2014 and subsequent years, this percentage is determined based only on the paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
