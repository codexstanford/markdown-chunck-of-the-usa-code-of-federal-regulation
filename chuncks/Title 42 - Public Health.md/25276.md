####### Abbreviated standard survey

means a focused survey other than a standard survey that gathers information on an HHA's compliance with fewer specific standards or conditions of participation. An abbreviated standard survey may be based on complaints received, a change of ownership or management, or other indicators of specific concern such as reapplication for Medicare billing privileges following a deactivation.
