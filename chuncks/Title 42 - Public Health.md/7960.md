###### ยง 411.33 Amount of Medicare secondary payment.
####### Example:

(b)An individual received treatment from a physician for which the physician charged $175. The primary payer allowed $150 of the charge and paid 80 percent of this amount or $120. The Medicare fee schedule for this treatment is $125. The individual's Part B deductible had been met. As secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following amounts:

(1) Excess of actual charge minus the primary payment: $175-120 = $55.

(2) Amount Medicare would pay if the services were not covered by a primary payer: .80 x $125 = $100.

(3) Primary payer's allowable charge without regard to its coinsurance (since that amount is higher than the Medicare fee schedule in this case) minus amount paid by the primary payer: $150-120 = $30.

(c)-(d) [Reserved]
