####### Standardization of data for variation in area wage levels and case-mix.

(4)The cost data described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are standardized to remove the effects of geographic variation in wage levels and facility variation in case-mix.

(i) The cost data are standardized for geographic variation in wage levels using the wage index. The application of the wage index is made on the basis of the location of the facility in an urban or rural area as defined in ยง 413.333.

(ii) Starting on October 1, 2022, CMS applies a cap on decreases to the wage index such that the wage index applied to a SNF is not less than 95 percent of the wage index applied to that SNF in the prior FY.

(iii) The cost data are standardized for facility variation in case-mix using the case-mix indices and other data that indicate facility case-mix.
