(v) For applications involving substandard patient or graft survival, the rationale and supporting evidence for CMS' review includes, but is not limited to-

(A) Root Cause Analysis for patient deaths and graft failures, including factors the program has identified as likely causal or contributing factors for patient deaths and graft failures;

(B) Program improvements that have been implemented and improvements that are planned;

(vi) For mitigating factors requests based on innovative practice:

(B) The literature, research, or other evidentiary basis that supports consideration of the practice(s) as innovative.

(vii) For requests based on natural disasters or public health emergency:

(A) A description of the disaster or emergency, the specific impact on the program, the time periods of the event(s) and of its immediate recovery aftermath;

(B) Identification of the transplants that occurred during the period for which the request is being made; and
