###### § 415.102 Conditions for fee schedule payment for physician services to beneficiaries in providers.
####### Effect of billing charges for physician services to a provider.

(c)(1) If a physician furnishes services that may be paid under the reasonable cost rules in § 415.55 or § 415.60, and paid by the intermediary, or would be paid under those rules except for the PPS rules in part 412 of this chapter, and under the payment rules for GME established by §§ 413.75 through 413.83 of this chapter, neither the provider nor the physician may seek payment from the carrier, beneficiary, or another insurer.

(2) If a physician furnishes services to an individual beneficiary that do not meet the applicable conditions in §§ 415.120 (concerning conditions for payment for radiology services) and 415.130 (concerning conditions for payment for physician pathology services), the carrier does not pay on a fee schedule basis.

(3) If the physician, the provider, or another entity bills the carrier or the beneficiary or another insurer for physician services furnished to the provider, as described in § 415.55(a), CMS considers the provider to which the services are furnished to have violated its provider participation agreement, and may terminate that agreement. See part 489 of this chapter for rules governing provider agreements.
