(c)Nothing in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section will be construed as precluding CMS or a Medicare administrative contractor, fiscal intermediary, or carrier, in the proper exercise of its duties and functions, from reviewing claims to determine:

(1) In the case of items or services not reviewed by a QIO, whether they meet coverage requirements of Title XVIII relating to medical necessity, reasonableness, or appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care. However, if a coverage determination pertains to medical necessity, reasonableness, or appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care, the Medicare administrative contractor, fiscal intermediary, or carrier must use a QIO to make a determination on those issues if a QIO is conducting review in the area and must abide by the QIO's determination.

(2) Whether any claim meets coverage requirements of Title XVIII relating to issues other than medical necessity, reasonableness or appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care.
