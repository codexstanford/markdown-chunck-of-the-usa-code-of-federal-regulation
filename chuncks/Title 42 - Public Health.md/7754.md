(d)Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2020 physical therapy or occupational therapy services covered as part of a rehabilitation plan of treatment described in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable-

(1) Claims for such services furnished in whole or in part by a physical therapist assistant or an occupational therapy assistant must be identified with the inclusion of the respective prescribed modifier; and

(2) Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2022, such claims are paid an amount equal to 85 percent of the amount of payment otherwise applicable for the service as defined at section 1834(k) of the Act.

(3) For purposes of this paragraph, "furnished in whole or in part" means when the physical therapist assistant or occupational therapy assistant either-

(i) Furnishes all the minutes of a service exclusive of the respective physical therapist or occupational therapist; or

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, furnishes a portion of a service, or in the case of a 15-minute (or other time interval) timed code, a portion of a unit of service, separately from the part furnished by the physical or occupational therapist such that the minutes for that portion of a service (or unit of a service) exceed 10 percent of the total time for that service (or unit of a service).

(iii) Paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply when determining whether the prescribed modifier applies to the last 15-minute unit of a service billed for a patient on a treatment day when the physical or occupational therapist provides more than the midpoint of a 15-minute timed code, that is, 8 or more minutes, regardless of any minutes for the same service furnished by the physical therapist assistant or occupational therapy assistant.

(iv) Where there are two remaining 15-minute units to bill of the same service and the physical therapist and the physical therapist assistant or the occupational therapist and the occupational therapy assistant, as applicable, each provided between 9 and 14 minutes, with a total time of at least 23 minutes, one unit of the service is billed with the prescribed modifier for the minutes furnished by the physical therapist assistant or occupational therapy assistant and one unit is billed without the prescribed modifier for the service provided by the physical therapist or occupational therapist.
