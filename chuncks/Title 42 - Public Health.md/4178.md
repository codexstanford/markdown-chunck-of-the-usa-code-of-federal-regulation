(7)EV is the transmission or the spread ofvirus from a vaccination site, after the use or administration of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine, to skin that has been affected by, or is currently affected with, eczema or atopic dermatitis. EV is characterized by lesions that include multiple blisters (vesicles or pustules), which generally evolve in a similar sequence or manner as the original vaccination site. The lesions may come together to form larger lesions. Lesions may also spread to patches of skin that have never been involved with eczema or atopic dermatitis. The new lesions, if cultured, will be positive forvirus. A person with EV may become severely ill with signs and symptoms that involve the whole body (systemic illness), such as fever, malaise, or enlarged glands (lymph nodes).
