####### Nonsubstantive changes.

(c)If CMS determines that a change to a measure previously adopted in the ASCQR Program is nonsubstantive, CMS will use a subregulatory process to revise the ASCQR Program Specifications Manual so that it clearly identifies the changes to that measure and provide links to where additional information on the changes can be found. When a measure undergoes subregulatory maintenance, CMS will provide notification of the measure specification update on the QualityNet Web site and in the ASCQR Program Specifications Manual, and will provide sufficient lead time for ASCs to implement the revisions where changes to the data collection systems would be necessary.
