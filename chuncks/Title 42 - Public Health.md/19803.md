####### General principles.

(b)The threshold methodology should:

(1) Not impact the timing or approval of an individual's eligibility for Medicaid.

(2) Not be biased in such a manner as to inappropriately establish the numbers of, or medical assistance expenditures for, individuals determined to be newly or not newly eligible.

(3) Provide a valid and accurate accounting of individuals who would have been eligible in accordance with the December 1, 2009 eligibility standards and applicable eligibility categories for the benefits described in ยง 433.204(a)(1), and subject to paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section, by incorporating simplified assessments of resources, enrollment cap requirements in place at that time, and other special circumstances as approved by CMS, respectively.

(4) Operate efficiently, without further review once an individual has been determined not to be newly eligible based on the December 1, 2009 standards for any eligibility category.
