() For a 3-day or less interruption of stay under paragraph (a)(1) of this section during which the patient receives inpatient or outpatient treatment or services at an acute care hospital or IRF, or SNF services, that are not otherwise excluded under ยง 412.509(a), the services must be provided under arrangements in accordance with ยง 412.509(c). CMS does not make a separate payment to the acute care hospital, IRF, or SNF for these services. The LTC-DRG payment made to the long-term care hospital is considered payment in full as specified in ยง 412.521(b).

(B) For a greater than 3-day interruption of stay under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CMS will make only one LTC-DRG payment for all portions of a long-term care stay. CMS also separately pays the acute care hospital, the IRF, or the SNF in accordance with their respective payment systems, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
