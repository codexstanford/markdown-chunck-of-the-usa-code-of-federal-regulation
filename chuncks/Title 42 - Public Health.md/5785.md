####### ยง 405.376 Suspension and termination of collection action and compromise of claims for overpayment.
######## Basis for termination of collection action.

(e)Collection action may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons:

(1) The United States cannot enforce collection of any significant sum;

(2) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security to be liquidated, the statute of limitations has run, and the prospects of collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of the claim;

(3) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed any recovery;

(4) It is determined the claim is without merit; or

(5) Evidence to substantiate the claim is no longer available.
