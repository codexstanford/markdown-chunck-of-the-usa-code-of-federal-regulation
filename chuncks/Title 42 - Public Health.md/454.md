###### Contiguous Area Considerations.

5.

Podiatric professional(s) in areas contiguous to an area being considered for designation will be considered excessively distant, overutilized or inaccessible to the population of the area under consideration if one of the following conditions prevails in each contiguous area:

(a) Podiatric professional(s) in the contiguous area are more than 40 minutes travel time from the center of the area being considered for designation.

(b) The population-to-foot care practitioner ratio in the contiguous areas is in excess of 20,000:1, indicating that contiguous area podiatric professional(s) cannot be expected to help alleviate the shortage situation in the area for which designation is requested.

(c) Podiatric professional(s) in the contiguous area are inaccessible to the population of the area under consideration because of specified access barriers (such as economic or cultural barriers).
