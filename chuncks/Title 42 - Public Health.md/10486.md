####### Initial selection of useful life.

(i)In selecting a proper useful life for computing depreciation under the Medicare program, providers must use the useful life guidelines published by CMS. If CMS has not published applicable useful life guidelines, providers must use-

(A) The edition of the American Hospital Association useful life guidelines, as specified in CMS Medicare program manuals; or

(B) A different useful life specifically requested by the provider and approved by the contractor. A different useful life may be approved by the contractor if the provider's request is properly supported by acceptable factors that affect the determination of useful life. However, such factors as an expected early sale, retirement, demolition or abandonment of an asset, or termination of the provider from the Medicare program may not be used.
