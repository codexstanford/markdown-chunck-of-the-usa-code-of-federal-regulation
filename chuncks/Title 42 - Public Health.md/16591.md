####### Use of other reconciliation processes.

(6)In the process of coordinating benefits between the correct Part D plan of record and another entity providing prescription drug coverage when that entity has incorrectly paid as primary payer for a covered Part D drug on behalf of a Part D enrollee, the correct Part D plan of record must achieve timely reconciliation through working directly with the other entity that incorrectly paid as primary payer, unless CMS has established reconciliation processes for payment reconciliation, rather than requesting pharmacy claims reversal and re-adjudication.
