## Chapter I - Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services
### Subchapter A - General Provisions
#### PART 2 - CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PATIENT RECORDS
##### Subpart A - Introduction
###### ยง 2.2 Purpose and effect.
####### Effect.

(b)(1) The regulations in this part prohibit the disclosure and use of patient records unless certain circumstances exist. If any circumstance exists under which disclosure is permitted, that circumstance acts to remove the prohibition on disclosure but it does not compel disclosure. Thus, the regulations do not require disclosure under any circumstances.

(2) The regulations in this part are not intended to direct the manner in which substantive functions such as research, treatment, and evaluation are carried out. They are intended to ensure that a patient receiving treatment for a substance use disorder in a part 2 program is not made more vulnerable by reason of the availability of their patient record than an individual with a substance use disorder who does not seek treatment.
