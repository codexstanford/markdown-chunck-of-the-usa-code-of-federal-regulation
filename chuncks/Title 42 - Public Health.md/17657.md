####### Timing of certification and recertification: Outlier cases subject to PPS.

(f)For outlier cases subject to the PPS, certification is required as follows:

(1) For day outlier cases, certification is required no later than 1 day after the hospital reasonably assumes that the case meets the outlier criteria, established in accordance with ยง 412.80(a)(1)(i) of this chapter, or no later than 20 days into the hospital stay, whichever is earlier. The first and subsequent recertifications are required at intervals established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so chooses) but not less frequently than every 30 days.

(2) For cost outlier cases, certification is required no later than the date on which the hospital requests cost outlier payment or 20 days into the hospital stay, whichever is earlier. If possible, certification must be made before the hospital incurs costs for which it will seek cost outlier payment. In cost outlier cases, the first and subsequent recertifications are required at intervals established by the UR committee (on a case-by-case basis if it so chooses).
