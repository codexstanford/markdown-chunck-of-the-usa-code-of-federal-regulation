####### ยง 405.1012 When CMS or its contractors may be a party to a hearing.
######## Invalid election.

(e)(1) An ALJ may determine that a CMS or contractor election is invalid under this section if the request for hearing was filed by an unrepresented beneficiary, the election was not timely, the election was not sent to the correct parties, or CMS or a contractor had already filed an election to be a party to the hearing and the ALJ did not determine that the entity's participation as a party is necessary for a full examination of the matters at issue.

(2) If an election is determined to be invalid, a written notice must be sent to the entity that submitted the election and the parties who were sent the notice of hearing.

(i) If the election was submitted after the hearing occurred, the written notice of invalid election must be sent no later than the date the decision, dismissal, or remand notice is mailed.

(ii) If the election was submitted before the hearing occurs, the written notice of invalid election must be sent prior to the hearing. If the notice would be sent fewer than 5 calendar days before the hearing is scheduled to occur, oral notice must be provided to the entity that submitted the election, and the written notice to the entity and the parties who were sent the notice of hearing must be sent as soon as possible after the oral notice is provided.
