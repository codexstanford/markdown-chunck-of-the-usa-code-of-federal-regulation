####### Final decisions denying EJR.

(2)If the final decision:

(i) Of the Board denies EJR solely on the basis that the Board determines it has the authority to decide the legal question relevant to the specific matter at issue, the Board must conduct further proceedings on the legal question and issue a decision on the matter at issue in accordance with this subpart.

Exception: If the provider(s) file(s) a lawsuit pertaining to the legal question, and for a period that is covered by the Board's decision denying EJR, the Board may not conduct any further proceedings under this subpart on the legal question or the matter at issue before the lawsuit is finally resolved.

(ii) Of the Board (or the Administrator) denies EJR on the basis that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the specific matter at issue, the Board (or the Administrator) must, as applicable, dismiss the specific matter at issue from the appeal, or dismiss the appeal entirely if there are no other matters at issue that are within the Board's jurisdiction and can be fully decided by the Board. If only the specific matter(s) is dismissed from the appeal, judicial review may be had only after a final decision on the appeal is made by the Board or Administrator, as applicable (as described in §§ 405.1840(d) and 405.1877(a) of this subpart). If the Board or the Administrator, as applicable, dismisses the appeal entirely, the decision is subject to judicial review under § 405.1877(a) of this subpart.
