####### Unusable organs.

(d)(1) An organ is not counted as a Medicare usable organ or a total usable organ in the ratio used to calculate Medicare's share of organ acquisition costs if a physician determines, upon initial inspection or after removal of the organ, that the organ is not viable and not medically suitable for transplant and is therefore unusable.

(2) OPOs and THs include the cost to procure unusable organs, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in total organ acquisition costs reported on their Medicare cost report.
