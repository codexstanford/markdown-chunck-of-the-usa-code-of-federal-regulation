####### Exception for decertified EHR technology.

(iii)Beginning with the fiscal year 2019 payment adjustment year, the Secretary shall exempt an eligible hospital that is not a qualifying eligible hospital from the application of the reduction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user is not possible because the certified EHR technology used by the eligible hospital has been decertified under ONC's Health IT Certification Program. To be considered for an exception, an eligible hospital must submit an application, in the manner specified by CMS, demonstrating that the certified EHR technology was decertified during the 12-month period preceding the applicable EHR reporting period for the payment adjustment year, or during the applicable EHR reporting period for the payment adjustment year, and that the eligible hospital made a good faith effort to obtain another certified EHR technology for that EHR reporting period. (See ยง 495.4 of this chapter for definitions of payment adjustment year, EHR reporting period, and meaningful EHR user.) Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS. This exception is subject to annual renewal, but in no case may an eligible hospital be granted an exception under paragraph (d)(4) of this section for more than 5 years.

(5) A State in which hospitals are paid for services under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act must-

(i) Adjust the payments to each eligible hospital in the State that is not a meaningful EHR user in a manner that is designed to result in an aggregate reduction in payments to hospitals in the State that is equivalent to the aggregate reduction that would have occurred if payments had been reduced to each eligible hospital in the State in a manner comparable to the reduction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and

(ii) Provide to the Secretary, by January 1, 2013, a report on the method that it proposes to employ in order to make the requisite payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.
