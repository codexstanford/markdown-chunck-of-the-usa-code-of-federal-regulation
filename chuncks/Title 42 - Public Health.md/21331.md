####### Evaluation of need.

(c)The agency must provide for an initial evaluation (and periodic reevaluations) of the need for the level of care furnished in a NF when there is a reasonable indication that individuals age 65 or older might need those services in the near future, but for the availability of home and community-based services. The procedures used to assess level of care for a potential waiver beneficiary must be at least as stringent as any existing State procedures applicable to individuals entering a NF. The qualifications of individuals performing the waiver assessment must be as high as those of individuals assessing the need for NF care, and the assessment instrument itself must be the same as any assessment instrument used to establish level of care of prospective inpatients in NFs. A periodic reevaluation of the level of care must be performed. The period of reevaluation of level of care cannot extend beyond 1 year.
