###### ยง 414.236 Continuity of pricing when HCPCS codes are divided or combined.
####### General rule.

(a)If a new HCPCS code is added, CMS or contractors make every effort to determine whether the item and service has a fee schedule pricing history. If there is a fee schedule pricing history, the previous fee schedule amounts for the old code(s) are mapped to the new code(s) to ensure continuity of pricing.
