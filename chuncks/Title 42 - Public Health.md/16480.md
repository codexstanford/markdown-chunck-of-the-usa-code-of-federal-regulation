(3) At any time, in instances of fraud or similar fault of the Part D sponsor or any subcontractor of the Part D sponsor.

(1) New and material evidence that was not readily available at the time the final determination was made is furnished;

(2) A clerical error in the computation of payments was made; or

(3) The evidence that was considered in making the determination clearly shows on its face that an error was made.
