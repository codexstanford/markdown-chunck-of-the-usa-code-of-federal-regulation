####### Public hearings.

(3)At least 20 days prior to submitting an application for a new demonstration project or extension of an existing demonstration project to CMS for review, the State must have conducted at least two public hearings, on separate dates and at separate locations, regarding the State's demonstration application at which members of the public throughout the State have an opportunity to provide comments. The State must use telephonic and/or Web conference capabilities for at least one of the two required public hearings to ensure statewide accessibility to the public hearing unless it can document it has afforded the public throughout the State the opportunity to provide comment, such as holding the two public hearings in geographically distinct areas of the State. The State must use at least two of the following public forums:

(i) The Medical Care Advisory Committee that operates in accordance with ยง 431.12 of this subpart; or

(ii) A commission or other similar process, where meetings are open to members of the public; or

(iii) A State legislative process, which would afford an interested party the opportunity to learn about the contents of the demonstration application, and to comment on its contents; or

(iv) Any other similar process for public input that would afford an interested party the opportunity to learn about the contents of the demonstration application, and to comment on its contents.
