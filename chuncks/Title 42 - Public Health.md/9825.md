####### Recordkeeping requirements for new providers.

(c)A newly participating provider of services (as defined in ยง 400.202 of this chapter) must make available to its selected contractor for examination its fiscal and other records for the purpose of determining such provider's ongoing recordkeeping capability and inform the contractor of the date its initial Medicare cost reporting period ends.

The data and information to be examined include cost, revenue, statistical, and other information pertinent to reimbursement including, but not limited to, that described in paragraph (d) of this section and in ยง 413.24.
