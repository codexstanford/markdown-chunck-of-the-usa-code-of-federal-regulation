(2) Find that in a significant number or proportion of cases, the provider has:

(i) Furnished Medicaid services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary, as determined in accordance with utilization guidelines established by the agency; or

(ii) Furnished Medicaid services of a quality that does not meet professionally recognized standards of health care.

(3) Notify CMS and the general public of the restriction and its duration.

(4) Ensure that the restrictions do not result in denying beneficiaries reasonable access (taking into account geographic location: and reasonable travel time) to Medicaid services of adequate quality, including emergency services.
