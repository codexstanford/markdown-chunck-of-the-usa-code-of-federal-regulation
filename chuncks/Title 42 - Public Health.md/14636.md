(2) Any statutory provisions (including penalty provisions) that apply to payment for services furnished to a beneficiary not enrolled in an MA plan also apply to the payment described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b) Services furnished by section 1861(u) providers of service. Any provider of services as defined in section 1861(u) of the Act that does not have in effect a contract establishing payment amounts for services furnished to a beneficiary enrolled in an MA coordinated care plan, an MSA plan, or an MA private fee-for-service plan must accept, as payment in full, the amounts (less any payments under §§ 412.105(g) and 413.76 of this chapter) that it could collect if the beneficiary were enrolled in original Medicare.
