###### ยง 482.30 Condition of participation: Utilization review.
####### Standard: Extended stay review.

(e)(1) In hospitals that are not paid under the prospective payment system, the UR committee must make a periodic review, as specified in the UR plan, of each current inpatient receiving hospital services during a continuous period of extended duration. The scheduling of the periodic reviews may-

(i) Be the same for all cases; or

(ii) Differ for different classes of cases.

(2) In hospitals paid under the prospective payment system, the UR committee must review all cases reasonably assumed by the hospital to be outlier cases because the extended length of stay exceeds the threshold criteria for the diagnosis, as described in ยง 412.80(a)(1)(i). The hospital is not required to review an extended stay that does not exceed the outlier threshold for the diagnosis.

(3) The UR committee must make the periodic review no later than 7 days after the day required in the UR plan.
