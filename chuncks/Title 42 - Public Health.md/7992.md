####### Limitations on Medicare payment.

(b)(1) Medicare does not pay for any services for which-

(i) Payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made under a workers' compensation law or plan of the United States or a state; or

(ii) Payment could be made under the Federal Black Lung Program, but is precluded solely because the provider of the services has failed to secure, from the Department of Labor, a provider number to include in the claim.

(2) If the payment for a service may not be made under workers' compensation because the service is furnished by a source not authorized to provide that service under the particular workers' compensation program, Medicare pays for the service if it is a covered service.

(3) Medicare makes secondary payments in accordance with §§ 411.32 and 411.33.
