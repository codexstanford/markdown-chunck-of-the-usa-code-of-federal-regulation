####### Provision of pre-election hospice services.

(3)(i) The services must be furnished by a physician.

(ii) The physician furnishing these services must be an employee or medical director of the hospice billing for this service.

(iii) The services cannot be furnished by hospice personnel other than employed physicians, such as but not limited to nurse practitioners, nurses, or social workers, physicians under contractual arrangements with the hospice or by the beneficiary's physician, if that physician is not an employee of the hospice.

(iv) If the beneficiary's attending physician is also the medical director or a physician employee of the hospice, the attending physician may not provide nor may the hospice bill for this service because that physician already possesses the expertise necessary to furnish end-of-life evaluation and management, and counseling services.
