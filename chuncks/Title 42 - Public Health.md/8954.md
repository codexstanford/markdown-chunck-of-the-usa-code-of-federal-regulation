() For fiscal year 2022, for Indian Health Service and Tribal hospitals and Puerto Rico hospitals that have a cost report for 2013, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare Supplemental Security Income (SSI) patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract and the most recent available year of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).
