####### § 405.1010 When CMS or its contractors may participate in the proceedings on a request for an ALJ hearing.
######## Limitation on participating in a hearing.

(d)(1) If CMS or a contractor has been made a party to a hearing in accordance with § 405.1012, no entity that elected to be a participant in the proceedings in accordance with this section (or that elected to be a party to the hearing but was made a participant in accordance with § 405.1012(d)(1)) may participate in the oral hearing, but such entity may file a position paper and/or written testimony to clarify factual or policy issues in the case.

(2) If CMS or a contractor did not elect to be a party to a hearing in accordance with § 405.1012 and more than one entity elected to be a participant in the proceedings in accordance with this section, only the first entity to file a response to the notice of hearing as provided under § 405.1020(c) may participate in the oral hearing. Entities that filed a subsequent response to the notice of hearing may not participate in the oral hearing, but may file a position paper and/or written testimony to clarify factual or policy issues in the case.

(3) If CMS or a contractor is precluded from participating in the oral hearing under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the ALJ may grant leave to the precluded entity to participate in the oral hearing if the ALJ determines that the entity's participation is necessary for a full examination of the matters at issue. If the ALJ does not grant leave to the precluded entity to participate in the oral hearing, the precluded entity may still be called as a witness by CMS or a contractor that is a party to the hearing in accordance with § 405.1012.
