() Report at least 3 measures, covering at least 1 of the National Quality Strategy domains and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies; or if less than 3 measures covering at least 1 NQS domain apply to the group practice, then the group practice must report 1-2 measures for which there is Medicare patient data and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. For a group practice who reports fewer than 3 measures covering at least 1 NQS domain via the registry-based reporting mechanism, the group practice would be subject to the Measures Applicability Validation process, which would allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported on additional measures. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted.
