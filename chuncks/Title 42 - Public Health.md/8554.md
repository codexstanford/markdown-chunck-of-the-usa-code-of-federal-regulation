####### Changes in the status of hospital units.

(c)For purposes of exclusions from the prospective payment systems under this section, the status of each hospital unit (excluded or not excluded) is determined as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

(1) The status of a hospital unit may be changed from not excluded to excluded only at the start of the cost reporting period. If a unit is added to a hospital after the start of a cost reporting period, it cannot be excluded from the prospective payment systems before the start of a hospital's next cost reporting period.

(2) The status of a hospital unit may be changed from excluded to not excluded at any time during a cost reporting period, but only if the hospital notifies the fiscal intermediary and the CMS Regional Office in writing of the change at least 30 days before the date of the change, and maintains the information needed to accurately determine costs that are or are not attributable to the excluded unit. A change in the status of a unit from excluded to not excluded that is made during a cost reporting period must remain in effect for the rest of that cost reporting period.
