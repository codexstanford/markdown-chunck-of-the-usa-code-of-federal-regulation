###### ยง 110.90 Reconsideration of the Secretary's eligibility and benefits determinations.
####### Right of reconsideration.

(a)A requester has the right to seek reconsideration of the Secretary's determination that he or she is not eligible for Program benefits. In addition, a requester who asserts that the amount of the benefits paid (or the fact that certain benefits were not paid or payable) is incorrect may also seek reconsideration. A requester may not seek reconsideration of the Secretary's decision as to the mechanism of payment. Requests for reconsideration must be in writing, describe the reason(s) why the decision should be reconsidered, and be postmarked within 60 calendar days of the date of the Secretary's decision on the Request for Benefits. Because no new documentation will be considered in the reconsideration process, the reconsideration request may not include or refer to any documentation that was not before the Secretary at the time of her determination.
