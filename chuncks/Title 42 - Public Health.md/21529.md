####### Applicability.

(2)(i) This section and ยง 442.42 apply only when the Medicaid agency, of its own volition, terminates or does not a renew a provider agreement, and only when the survey agency certifies that there is no jeopardy to beneficiary health and safety. When the survey agency certifies that there is jeopardy to beneficiary health and safety, or when it fails to certify that there is no jeopardy, FFP ends on the effective date of termination or expiration.

(ii) When the State acts under instructions from CMS, FFP ends on the date specified by CMS (CMS instructs the State to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement when CMS in validating a State survey agency certification, determines that an ICF/IID does not meet the requirements for participation.)
