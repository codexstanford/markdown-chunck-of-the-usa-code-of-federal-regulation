###### § 1001.501 License revocation or suspension.
####### Consideration of early reinstatement.

(c)(1) If an individual or entity that is excluded in accordance with this section fully and accurately discloses the circumstances surrounding the action that formed the basis for the exclusion to a licensing authority of a different State or to a different licensing authority in the same State and that licensing authority grants the individual or entity a new health care license or has decided to take no adverse action as to a currently held health care license, the OIG will consider a request for early reinstatement. The OIG will consider the following factors in determining whether a request for early reinstatement under this paragraph (c)(1) will be granted:

(i) The circumstances that formed the basis for the exclusion;

(ii) Whether the second licensing authority is in a state that is not the individual's primary place of practice;

(iii) Evidence that the second licensing authority was aware of the circumstances surrounding the action that formed the basis for the exclusion;

(iv) Whether the individual has demonstrated that he or she has satisfactorily resolved any underlying problem that caused or contributed to the basis for the initial licensing action;

(v) The benefits to the Federal health care programs and program beneficiaries of early reinstatement;

(vi) The risks to the Federal health care programs and program beneficiaries of early reinstatement;

(vii) Any additional or pending license actions in any State;

(viii) Any ongoing investigations involving the individual; and

(ix) All the factors set forth in § 1001.3002(b).

(2) If an exclusion has been imposed under this section and the individual does not have a valid health care license of any kind in any State, that individual may request the OIG to consider whether he or she may be eligible for early reinstatement. The OIG will consider the following factors in determining whether a request for early reinstatement under this paragraph (c)(2) will be granted:

(i) The length of time the individual has been excluded. The OIG will apply a presumption against early reinstatement under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the person has been excluded for less than 3 years; however, if the revocation or suspension on which the exclusion is based was for a set period longer than 3 years, the presumption against early reinstatement will be coterminous with the period set by the licensing board;

(ii) The circumstances that formed the basis for the exclusion;

(iii) Whether the individual has demonstrated that he or she has satisfactorily resolved any underlying problem that caused or contributed to the basis for the initial licensing action;

(iv) The benefits to the Federal health care programs and program beneficiaries of early reinstatement;

(v) The risks to the Federal health care programs and program beneficiaries of early reinstatement;

(vi) Any additional or pending license actions in any State;

(vii) Any ongoing investigations involving the individual; and

(viii) All the factors set forth in § 1001.3002(b).

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, if an individual's license revocation or suspension was for reasons related to patient abuse or neglect, the OIG will not consider an application for early reinstatement.

(4) Except for § 1001.3002(a)(1)(i), all the provisions of subpart F (§§ 1001.3001 through 1001.3005) apply to early reinstatements under this section.
