### Subchapter A - General Provisions
#### PART 2 - CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PATIENT RECORDS
##### Subpart C - Disclosures With Patient Consent
###### ยง 2.33 Disclosures permitted with written consent.
####### e.g.,

(15) Determinations of eligibility or coverage (coordination of benefit services or the determination of cost sharing amounts), and adjudication or subrogation of health benefit claims;

(16) Risk adjusting amounts due based on enrollee health status and demographic characteristics;

(19) Other payment/health care operations activities not expressly prohibited in this provision.

(c) Lawful holders who wish to disclose patient identifying information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must have in place a written contract or comparable legal instrument with the contractor or voluntary legal representative, which provides that the contractor, subcontractor, or voluntary legal representative is fully bound by the provisions of part 2 upon receipt of the patient identifying information. In making any such disclosures, the lawful holder must furnish such recipients with the notice required under ยง 2.32; require such recipients to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized uses and disclosures; and require such recipients to report any unauthorized uses, disclosures, or breaches of patient identifying information to the lawful holder. The lawful holder may only disclose information to the contractor or subcontractor or voluntary legal representative that is necessary for the contractor or subcontractor or voluntary legal representative to perform its duties under the contract or comparable legal instrument. Contracts may not permit a contractor or subcontractor or voluntary legal representative to re-disclose information to a third party unless that third party is a contract agent of the contractor or subcontractor, helping them provide services described in the contract, and only as long as the agent only further discloses the information back to the contractor or lawful holder from which the information originated.
