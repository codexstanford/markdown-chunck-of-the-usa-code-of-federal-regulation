####### Consideration of hardship exception request.

(h)CMS has 60 days in which to approve or disapprove a hardship exception request. If a provider submits a request for hardship exception to the fee and the provider or supplier has not already submitted the fee consistent with provisions in ยง 424.514(a) and (b), and the request for hardship exception is not approved, CMS notifies the provider or supplier that the hardship exception request was not approved and allows the provider or supplier 30 days from the date of notification to submit the application fee.

(1) A Medicare contractor does not-

(i) Begin processing an enrollment application that is accompanied by a hardship exception request until CMS has made a decision to approve or disapprove the hardship exception request; and

(ii) Deny an enrollment application that is accompanied by a hardship exception request unless the hardship exception request is denied by CMS and the provider or supplier fails to submit the required application fee within 30 days of being notified that the request for a hardship exception was denied.

(2) A hardship exception determination made by CMS is appealable using ยง 405.874 of this chapter.
