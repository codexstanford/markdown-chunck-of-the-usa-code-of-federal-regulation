####### Adjustments to penalties.

(2)Based on revisit survey findings, adjustments to penalties may be made after a review of the provider's attempted correction of deficiencies.

(i) CMS may increase a CMP in increments based on a hospice program's inability or failure to correct deficiencies, the presence of a system-wide failure in the provision of quality care, or a determination of immediate jeopardy with actual harm versus immediate jeopardy with potential for harm.

(ii) CMS may also decrease a CMP in increments to the extent that it finds, in accordance with a revisit, that substantial and sustainable improvements have been implemented even though the hospice program is not yet in compliance with the conditions of participation.

(iii) No penalty assessment exceeds $10,000, as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, for each day a hospice program is not in substantial compliance with one or more conditions of participation.
