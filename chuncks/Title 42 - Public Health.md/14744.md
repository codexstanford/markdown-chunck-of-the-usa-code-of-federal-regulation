####### Risk adjustment factors for determination of savings for regional plans.

(e)CMS will publish the first Monday in April before the upcoming calendar year the risk adjustment factors described in paragraph (e)(1)and (e)(2) of this section determined for the purpose of calculating savings amounts for MA regional plans.

(1) For the purpose of calculating savings for MA regional plans, CMS has the authority to apply risk adjustment factors that are plan-specific average risk adjustment factors, Region-wide average risk adjustment factors, or factors determined on a basis other than MA regions.

(2) In the event that CMS applies region-wide average risk adjustment factors, the region-wide factor for each MA region is the average of the risk factors calculated under ยง 422.308(c), based on all enrollees in MA regional plans in that region in the previous year. In the case of a region in which no regional plan was offered in the previous year, CMS will estimate an average and may base this average on average risk adjustment factors applied to comparable regions or applied on a national basis.
