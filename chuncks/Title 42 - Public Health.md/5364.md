####### Recoupment procedures.

(b)The amount of the overpayment will be recouped on a proportionate basis from each of those hospitals that received payments under the State system that exceeded the payments they would have received under the Medicare payment system. Each hospital's share of the aggregate excess payment will be determined on the basis of a comparison of the hospital's proportionate share of the aggregate payment received under the State system that is in excess of what the aggregate payment would have been under the Medicare payment system. Recoupments may be accomplished by a hospital's direct payment to the Medicare program or by offsets to future payments made to the hospital.
