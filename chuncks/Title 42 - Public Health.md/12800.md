####### Assumption of financial risk.

(b)Each HMO must assume full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic health services, except that it may obtain insurance or make other arrangements as follows:

(1) For the cost of providing to any enrollee basic health services with an aggregate value of more than $5,000 in any year.

(2) For the cost of basic health services obtained by its enrollees from sources other than the HMO because medical necessity required that they be furnished before they could be secured through the HMO.

(3) For not more than 90 percent of the amount by which its costs for any of its fiscal years exceed 115 percent of its income for that fiscal year.

(4) For physicians or other health professionals, health care institutions, or any other combination of such individuals or institutions to assume all or part of the financial risk on a prospective basis for their furnishing of basic health services to the HMO's enrollees.
