####### ยง 435.904 Establishment of outstation locations to process applications for certain low-income eligibility groups.
######## Outstation locations: general requirements.

(c)(1) The agency must establish either-

(i) Outstation locations at each disproportionate share hospital, as defined in section 1923(a)(1)(A) of the Act, and each Federally-qualified health center, as defined in section 1905(1)(2)(B) of the Act, participating in the Medicaid program and providing services to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and children; or

(ii) Other outstation locations, which include at least some, disproportionate share hospitals and federally-qualified health centers, as specified under an alternative State plan that is submitted to and approved by CMS if the following conditions are met:

(A) The State must demonstrate that the alternative plan for outstationing is equally effective as, or more effective than, a plan that would meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section in enabling the individuals described in paragraph (b) of this section to apply for and receive Medicaid; and

(B) The State must provide assurances that the level of staffing and funding committed by the State under the alternative plan equals or exceeds the level of staffing and funding under a plan that would meet the requirements of establishing the outstation locations at the sites specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) The agency must establish outstation locations at Indian health clinics operated by a tribe or tribal organization as these clinics are specifically included in the definition of Federally-qualified health centers under section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Act and are also included in the definition of rural health clinics under part 491, subpart A of this chapter.

(3) The agency may establish additional outstation locations at any other site where potentially eligible pregnant women or children receive services-for example, at school-linked service centers and family support centers. These additional sites may also include sites other than the main outstation location of those Federally-qualified health centers or disproportionate share hospitals providing services to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and to children and that operate more than one site.

(4) The agency may, at its option, enter into reciprocal agreements with neighboring States to ensure that the groups described in paragraph (b) of this section who customarily receive services in a neighboring State have the opportunity to apply at outstation locations specified in paragraphs (c)(l) and (2) of this section.
