(c)In order to maintain the interim payments at the level of current reasonable costs, CMS will adjust the interim per capita rate, to the extent necessary, on the basis of adequate data supplied by the HMO or CMP in its interim estimated cost and enrollment reports or on other evidence showing that the rate based on actual costs is more or less than the current rate. Adjustments may also be made if there is-

(1) A change in the number of Medicare enrollees that affects the per capita rate;

(2) A material variation from the costs estimated when the annual operating budget was prepared; or

(3) A significant change in the use of covered services by the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees.
