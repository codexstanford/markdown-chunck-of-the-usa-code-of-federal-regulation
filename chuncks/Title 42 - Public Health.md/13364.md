####### Repayment.

(c)The principal amount of each loan or loan guarantee, together with interest thereon is repayable in accordance with a repayment schedule that is agreed upon by the parties to the loan or loan guarantee and approved by the Secretary before or at the time of endorsement of the loan. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Secretary, each loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary is repayable in substantially level combined installments of principal and interest to be paid at intervals not less frequently than annually, sufficient in amount to amortize the loan through the final year of the life of the loan. Principal repayment during the first 60 months of operation could be deferred with payment of interest only during that period. The Secretary could set rates of interest for each disbursement at a rate comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on the date of disbursement for marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate administrative charges.
