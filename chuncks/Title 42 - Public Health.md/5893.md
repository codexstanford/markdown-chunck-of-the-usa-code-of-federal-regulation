####### Use of relative value scales.

(c)If, for a particular medical procedure or service, the carrier is unable to determine the customary charge on the basis of reliable statistical data (for example, because the carrier does not yet have sufficient data or because the performance of the particular medical procedure or service by the physician or other person is infrequent), the carrier may use appropriate relative value scales to determine the customary charge for such procedure or service in relation to customary charges of the same physician or person for other medical procedures and services.
