####### Denial or discontinuation of access to the API.

(e)A State may deny or discontinue any third-party application's connection to the API required under paragraph (a) of this section if the State:

(1) Reasonably determines, consistent with its security risk analysis under 45 CFR part 164 subpart C, that allowing an application to connect or remain connected to the API would present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of protected health information on the State's systems; and

(2) Makes this determination using objective, verifiable criteria that are applied fairly and consistently across all applications and developers through which beneficiaries seek to access their electronic health information as defined at 45 CFR 171.102, including but not limited to criteria that may rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools.
