###### ยง 413.180 Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates.
####### Period of approval: Payment exception request.

(i)A prospective exception payment rate approved by CMS applies for the period from the date the complete exception request was filed with its contractor until 30 days after the contractor's receipt of the facility's letter notifying the contractor of the facility's request to give up its exception rate and be subject to the basic case-mix adjusted composite payment rate methodology. ESRD facilities electing to retain their nonpediatric or pediatric exception rates (including self-dialysis training) do not need to notify their contractors. Once a facility notifies its contractor in writing that it cannot retain its current exception rate, that decision cannot be subsequently reversed.
