###### ยง 57.204 Payment of Federal capital contributions and reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary.
####### Annual payment.

(a)The Secretary will make payments to each school with which he or she has entered into an agreement under the Act at a time determined by him or her. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by all schools for Federal capital contributions exceeds the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:

(1) The amount requested in the application, or

(2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan Program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in all participating schools during that year. Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications requested more than the amount paid to them, but with whatever adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding the total requested by it.
