####### Basis for the prospective payment.

(iii)Payment to the long-term care hospital is based on the patient's LTC-DRG that is determined in accordance with ยง 412.513(b).

(2) If the total number of days of a patient's length of stay in a long-term care hospital prior to and following a 3-day or less interruption of stay under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section or a greater than 3-day interruption of stay under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(D) of this section is up to and including five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay of the LTC-DRG, CMS will make a Federal prospective payment for a short-stay outlier in accordance with ยง 412.529(c).

(3) If the total number of days of a patient's length of stay in a long-term care hospital prior to and following a 3-day or less interruption of stay under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section or a greater than 3-day interruption of stay under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(D) of this section exceeds five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for the LTC-DRG, CMS will make one full Federal LTC-DRG prospective payment for the case. An additional payment will be made if the patient's stay qualifies as a high-cost outlier, as set forth in ยง 412.525(a).

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if a patient who has been discharged from a long-term care hospital to another facility and is readmitted to the long-term care hospital for additional treatment or services in the long-term care hospital following the stay at the other facility, the subsequent admission to the long-term care hospital is considered a new stay, even if the case is determined to fall into the same LTC-DRG, and the long-term care hospital will receive two separate Federal prospective payments if one of the following conditions are met:

(i) The patient has a length of stay in the acute care hospital that exceeds 9 days from the day of discharge from the long-term care hospital;

(ii) The patient has a length of stay in the IRF that exceeds 27 days from the day of discharge from the long-term care hospital; or

(iii) The patient has a length of stay in the SNF that exceeds 45 days from the day of discharge from the long-term care hospital.
