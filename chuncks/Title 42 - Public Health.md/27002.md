(5)(i) If a measure (or associated objective) in paragraph (d) of this section references paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the measure may be calculated by reviewing only the actions for patients whose records are maintained using CEHRT. A patient's record is maintained using CEHRT if sufficient data were entered in the CEHRT to allow the record to be saved, and not rejected due to incomplete data.

(ii) If the objective and associated measure does not reference paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the measure must be calculated by reviewing all patient records, not just those maintained using CEHRT.
