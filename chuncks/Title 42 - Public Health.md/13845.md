####### Person with an ownership or control interest.

(b)In order to determine the percentage of ownership interest in any mortgage, deed of trust, note, or other obligation, the percentage of interest owned in obligation is multiplied by the percentage of the disclosing entity's assets used to secure the obligation. For example, if A owns 10 percent of a note secured by 60 percent of the provider's assets, A's interest in the provider's assets equates to 6 percent and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 40 percent of a note secured by 10 percent of the provider's assets, B's interest in the provider's assets equates to 4 percent and need not be reported.
