####### Determination of applicable facility score.

(5)

(i) A facility-based MIPS eligible clinician is scored with facility-based measurement using the score derived from the value-based purchasing score for the facility at which the clinician provided services to the most Medicare beneficiaries during the period the claims are drawn from in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If there is an equal number of Medicare beneficiaries treated at more than one facility, the value-based purchasing score for the highest scoring facility is used.

(ii) A facility-based MIPS eligible group is scored with facility-based measurement using the score derived from the value-based purchasing score for the facility at which the plurality of clinicians identified as facility-based would have had their score determined under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.
