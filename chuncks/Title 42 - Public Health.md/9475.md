####### Prohibited charges.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a long-term care hospital may not charge a beneficiary for any covered services for which payment is made by Medicare, even if the hospital's costs of furnishing services to that beneficiary are greater than the amount the hospital is paid under the prospective payment system.

(1) If Medicare has paid at the full LTCH prospective payment system standard Federal payment rate, that payment applies to the hospital's costs for services furnished until the high-cost outlier threshold is met.

(2) If Medicare pays less than the full LTCH prospective payment system standard Federal payment rate and payment was not made at the site neutral payment rate (including, when applicable, the blended payment rate), that payment only applies to the hospital's costs for those costs or days used to calculate the Medicare payment.

(3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016, for Medicare payments to a long-term care hospital described in ยง 412.23(e)(2)(ii), that payment only applies to the hospital's costs for those costs or days used to calculate the Medicare payment.

(4) If Medicare has paid at the full site neutral payment rate, that payment applies to the hospital's costs for services furnished until the high-cost outlier is met.
