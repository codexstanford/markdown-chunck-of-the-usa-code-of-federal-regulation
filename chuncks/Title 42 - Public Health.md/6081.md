If additional materials submitted with the request are necessary to provide the information required for a complete request in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, copies of the materials must be sent to the parties as well (subject to authorities that apply to disclosing the personal information of other parties). If additional evidence is submitted with the request for hearing, the appellant may send a copy of the evidence, or briefly describe the evidence pertinent to the party and offer to provide copies of the evidence to the party at the party's request (subject to authorities that apply to disclosing the evidence).

(2) Evidence that a copy of the request for hearing or request for review of a QIC dismissal, or a copy of submitted evidence or a summary thereof, was sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section includes-

(iii) An affidavit or certificate of service that identifies the name and address of the recipient, and what was sent to the recipient; or

(3) If the appellant, other than an unrepresented beneficiary, fails to send a copy of the request for hearing or request for review of a QIC dismissal, any additional materials, or a copy of submitted evidence or a summary thereof, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the appellant will be provided with an additional opportunity to send the request, materials, and/or evidence or summary thereof, and if an adjudication time frame applies, it begins upon receipt of evidence that the request, materials, and/or evidence or summary thereof were sent. If the appellant, other than an unrepresented beneficiary, again fails to provide evidence that the request, materials, and/or evidence or summary thereof were sent within the additional time frame provided to send the request, materials, and/or evidence or summary thereof, the appellant's request for hearing or request for review of a QIC dismissal will be dismissed.
