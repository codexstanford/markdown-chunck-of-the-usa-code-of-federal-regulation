(c)Transplant programs must maintain up-to-date and accurate patient management records for each patient who receives an evaluation for placement on a program's waiting list and who is admitted for organ transplantation.

(1) For each patient who receives an evaluation for placement on a program's waiting list, the program must document in the patient's record that the patient (and in the case of a kidney patient, the patient's usual dialysis facility) has been informed of his or her transplant status, including notification of:

(i) The patient's placement on the program's waiting list;

(ii) The program's decision not to place the patient on its waiting list; or

(iii) The program's inability to make a determination regarding the patient's placement on its waiting list because further clinical testing or documentation is needed.

(3) In the case of patients admitted for organ transplants, transplant programs must maintain written records of:

(ii) Multidisciplinary discharge planning for post-transplant care.
