####### Affiliated practitioner individual determination under the Medicare Option.

(2)For Advanced APMs to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, QP determinations are made individually for each eligible clinician. To be assessed as an Affiliated Practitioner, an eligible clinician must be identified on an Affiliated Practitioner List on one of the dates: March 31, June 30, or August 31 of the QP Performance Period. An eligible clinician included on an Affiliated Practitioner List on any one of these dates is assessed as an Affiliated Practitioner even if that eligible clinician is not included on the Affiliated Practitioner List at one of the prior or later listed dates. For such eligible clinicians, CMS performs QP determinations during the QP Performance Period using claims data for services furnished from January 1 through each of the respective QP determination dates that the eligible clinician is on the Affiliated Practitioner List: March 31, June 30, and August 31.
