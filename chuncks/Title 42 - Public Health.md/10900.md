###### ยง 413.414 Medicare secondary payer and organ acquisition costs.
####### Medicare may have secondary payer liability for organ acquisition costs.

(c)When the primary insurer's agreement does not require the TH that performs the transplant to accept the payment from the primary insurer as payment in full, and the payment the TH receives from the primary insurer for the transplant and organ acquisition costs is insufficient to cover the entire cost, Medicare may have a secondary payer liability to the TH that performs the transplant for the organ acquisition costs.

(1) To determine whether Medicare has a secondary payer liability for the organ acquisition costs, it is necessary for the TH that performs the transplant to submit a bill to its contractor and to compare the total cost of the transplant, including the transplant DRG amount and the organ acquisition costs, to the payment received from the primary payer.

(2) If the payment from the primary payer is greater than the cost of the transplant DRG and the organ acquisition costs, there is no Medicare liability and the TH must not count the organ as a Medicare usable organ.

(3) If the payment from the primary payer is less than the transplant DRG and the organ acquisition costs, there is a Medicare secondary payer liability and all of the following must occur:

(i) The TH must pro-rate the payment from the primary payer between the transplant DRG payment and the organ acquisition payment.

(ii) Only the TH that performs the transplant counts the organ as a Medicare usable organ.

(iii) The portion of the payment applicable to organ acquisition is used on the cost report to reduce the Medicare organ acquisition costs.
