###### ยง 413.79 Direct GME payments: Determination of the weighted number of FTE residents.
####### Host Hospital Exception from the Rolling Average for the Period from August 29, 2005 to June 30, 2006.

(iv)To determine the FTE resident count for a host hospital that is training residents in excess of its cap, a two step process will be applied. First, subject to the limit at paragraph (f)(6)(i)(D) of this section, a host hospital is to exclude the displaced FTE residents that are counted by a host hospital in excess of the hospital's cap pursuant to an emergency Medicare GME affiliation agreement from August 29, 2005, to June 30, 2006, from the current year's FTE resident count before applying the three-year rolling averaging rules under paragraph (d) of this section to calculate the average FTE resident count. Second, the displaced FTE residents that are counted by the host hospital in excess of the host hospital's cap pursuant to an emergency Medicare GME affiliation agreement from August 29, 2005, to June 30, 2006, are added to the hospital's 3-year rolling average FTE resident count to determine the host hospital's FTE resident count for payment purposes.

(8) FTE resident cap slots added under section 126 of Public Law 116-260 may be used in a Medicare GME affiliation agreement beginning in the fifth year after the effective date of those FTE resident cap slots.
