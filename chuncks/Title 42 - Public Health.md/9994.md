####### Accelerated payments to providers.

(g)Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to a provider of services that is not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph (h) of this section if the provider has experienced financial difficulties due to a delay by the contractor in making payments or in exceptional situations, in which the provider has experienced a temporary delay in preparing and submitting bills to the contractor beyond its normal billing cycle. Any such payment must be approved first by the contractor and then by CMS. The amount of the payment is computed as a percentage of the net reimbursement for unbilled or unpaid covered services. Recovery of the accelerated payment may be made by recoupment as provider bills are processed or by direct payment.
