####### Self-disallowance procedures

(2). In order to properly self-disallow a specific item, the provider must-

(i) Include an estimated reimbursement amount for each specific self-disallowed item in the protested amount line (or lines) of the provider's cost report; and

(ii) Attach a separate work sheet to the provider's cost report for each specific self-disallowed item, explaining why the provider self-disallowed each specific item (instead of claiming full reimbursement in its cost report for the specific item) and describing how the provider calculated the estimated reimbursement amount for each specific self-disallowed item.
