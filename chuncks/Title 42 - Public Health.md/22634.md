####### 10 Percent Limit.

(c)The 10 percent limit is-

(1) Applied on an annual fiscal year basis;

(2) Calculated based on the total computable expenditures claimed by the State on quarterly expenditure reports submitted for a fiscal year. Expenditures claimed on a quarterly report for a different fiscal year may not be used in the calculation; and

(3) Calculated using the following formula:

(d) The expenditures under section 2105(a)(2) of the Act that are subject to the 10 percent limit are applied-

(1) On an annual fiscal year basis; and

(2) Against the 10 percent limit in the fiscal year for which the State submitted a quarterly expenditure report including the expenditures. Expenditures claimed on a quarterly report for one fiscal year may not be applied against the 10 percent limit for any other fiscal year.

(e)(1) The 10 percent limit for a fiscal year, as calculated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, may be no greater than 10 percent of the total computable amount (determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) of the State allotment or allotments available in that fiscal year. Therefore, the 10 percent limit is the lower of the amount calculated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and 10 percent of the total computable amount of the State allotment available in that fiscal year.

(2) As used in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the total computable amount of a State's allotment for a fiscal year is determined by dividing the State's allotment for the fiscal year by the State's enhanced FMAP for the year. For example, if a State allotment for a fiscal year is $65 million and the enhanced FMAP rate for the fiscal year is 65 percent, the total computable amount of the allotment for the fiscal year is $100 million ($65 million/.65). In this example, the 10 percent limit may be no greater than a total computable amount of $10 million (10 percent of $100 million).
