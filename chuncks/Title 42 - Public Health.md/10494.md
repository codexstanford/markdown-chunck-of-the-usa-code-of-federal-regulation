####### Recovery of accelerated depreciation,General.

(3)-(i)If a provider who has used an accelerated method of depreciation for any of its assets terminates participation in the program, or if the Medicare proportion of its allowable costs decreases so that cumulatively substantially more depreciation was paid than would have been paid using the straight-line method of depreciation, the excess of reimbursable cost determined by using accelerated depreciation methods and paid under the program over the reimbursable cost that would have been determined and paid under the program by using the straight-line method of depreciation, will be recovered as an offset to current reimbursement due or, if the provider has terminated participation in the program, as an overpayment. In this determination of excess payment, recognition will be given to the effects the adjustment to straight-line depreciation would have on the return on equity capital and on the allowance in lieu of specific recognition of other costs in the respective years.
