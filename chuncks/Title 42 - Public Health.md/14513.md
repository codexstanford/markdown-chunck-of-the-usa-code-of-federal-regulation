####### Reliability

means a measure of the fraction of the variation among the observed measure values that is due to real differences in quality ("signal") rather than random variation ("noise"); it is reflected on a scale from 0 (all differences in plan performance measure scores are due to measurement error) to 1 (the difference in plan performance scores is attributable to real differences in performance).
