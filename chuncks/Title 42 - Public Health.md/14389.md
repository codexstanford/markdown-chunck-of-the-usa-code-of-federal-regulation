####### New or expanding service area applicants.

(7)Beginning with contract year 2024, an applicant for a new or expanding service area receives a 10-percentage point credit towards the percentage of beneficiaries residing within published time and distance standards for the contracted network in the pending service area, at the time of application and for the duration of the application review. In addition, applicants may use a Letter of Intent (LOI), signed by both the MA organization (MAO) and the provider or facility with which the MAO has started or intends to negotiate, in lieu of a signed contract at the time of application and for the duration of the application review, to meet network standards. As part of the network adequacy review process, applicants must notify CMS of their use of LOIs to meet network standards in lieu of a signed contract and submit copies upon request and in the form and manner directed by CMS. At the beginning of the applicable contract year, the credit and the use of LOIs no longer apply and if the application is approved, the MA organization must be in full compliance with this section, including having signed contracts with the provider or facility.
