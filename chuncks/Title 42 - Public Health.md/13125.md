####### Payments

means any amounts the HMO or CMP pays physicians or physician groups for services they furnish directly, plus amounts paid for administration and amounts paid (in whole or in part) based on use and costs of referral services (such as withhold amounts, bonuses based on referral levels, and any other compensation to the physician or physician group to influence the use of referral services). Bonuses and other compensation that are not based on referral levels (such as bonuses based solely on quality of care furnished, patient satisfaction, and participation on committees) are not considered payments for purposes of this section.
