###### ยง 417.560 Apportionment: Part B physician and supplier services.
####### Medical services furnished under arrangements made by the HMO or CMP.

(b)When the HMO or CMP pays for Part B physician and supplier services on some basis other than fee-for-service, the reasonable cost the HMO or CMP pays under its financial arrangement with the physician or supplier must be apportioned between Medicare enrollees and others based on the ratio of covered services furnished to Medicare enrollees to the total services furnished to all enrollees and nonenrolled patients. If apportionment on this basis would result in Medicare bearing the cost of furnishing services to individuals who are not Medicare enrollees, the Medicare share must be determined on another basis (approved by CMS) to ensure that Medicare pays only for services furnished to Medicare enrollees.
