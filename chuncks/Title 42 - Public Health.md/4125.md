##### Subpart G - Documentation Required for the Secretary To Determine Program Benefits
###### ยง 110.63 Documentation a legal or personal representative must submit when filing on behalf of a minor or on behalf of an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits.
####### e.g.,

(2) Documentation showing that the representative is the legal guardian of the property or estate of the minor (appointment of guardianship by a court of competent jurisdiction). If a minor has more than one legal guardian, this documentation is required only of one legal guardian. In the alternative, documentation showing that the minor is considered emancipated under applicable State law. In accordance with ยง 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive the requirement of documentation of guardianship for good cause.

(b) For an eligible requester who is an adult who lacks legal capacity to receive payment of benefits:

(1) Documentation showing that the requester is an adult who lacks this legal capacity (e.g., declaration of legal incapacity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or comparable documentation); and

(2) A decree by a court of competent jurisdiction establishing a guardianship or conservatorship of the requester's estate under applicable State law, or durable power of attorney, if applicable. In accordance with ยง 110.83(b), the Program reserves the right to waive this requirement for good cause.
