#### PART 5 - DESIGNATION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONAL(S) SHORTAGE AREAS
##### Appendix C to Part 5 - Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages of Mental Health Professionals
###### Determination of size of shortage.

C.Size of shortage will be computed as follows:

Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having a shortage of psychiatric manpower if both of the following criteria are met:

(a) The institution has more than 250 inmates, and

(b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of FTE psychiatrists serving the institution is at least 1,000:1.

Here the number of internees is defined as follows:

(i) If the number of new inmates per year and the average length-of-stay are not specified, or if the information provided does not indicate that intake psychiatric examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-

Number of internees=average number of inmates

(ii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as one year or more, and the intake psychiatric examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-

Number internees=average number of inmates+number of new inmates per year

(iii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as less than one year, and intake psychiatric examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-

Number of internees=average number of inmates+x[1+(2xALOS)]xnumber of new inmates per year

where ALOS=average length-of-stay (in fraction of year) (The number of FTE psychiatrists is computed as in Part I, Section B, paragraph 3 above.)

Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups, based on the number of inmates and/or the ration (R) of internees to FTE psychiatrists, as follows:

Group 1-Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no psychiatrist.

Group 2-Other institutions with no psychiatrists and institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 3,000:1.

Group 3-Institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 2,000:1 but less than 3,000:1.
