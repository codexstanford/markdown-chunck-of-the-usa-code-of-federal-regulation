####### Determination of the blended benchmark amount,General rules.

(d)-(1)For the purpose of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the term blended benchmark amount for an area for a year means the sum of two components: the applicable amount determined under section 1853(k)(1) of the Act and the specified amount determined under section 1853(n)(2) of Act. The weights for each component are based on the phase-in period assigned each area, as described in paragraphs (d)(8) and (d)(9) of this section. At the conclusion of an area's phase-in period, the blended benchmark for an area for a year equals the section 1853(n)(2) of the Act specified amount described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The blended benchmark amount for an area for a year (which takes into account paragraph (d)(8) of this section), cannot exceed the applicable amount described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that would be in effect but for the application of this paragraph.
