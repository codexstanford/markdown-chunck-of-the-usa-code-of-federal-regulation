####### Geographic region

means an area that includes the SNFs with which a hospital has traditionally arranged transfers and all other SNFs within the same proximity to the hospital. In the case of a hospital without existing transfer practices upon which to base a determination, the geographic region is an area that includes all the SNFs within 50 miles (as defined in ยง 412.92(c)(1) of this chapter) of the hospital unless the hospital can demonstrate that the SNFs are inaccessible to its patients. In the event of a dispute as to whether an SNF is within a hospital's geographic region or the SNF is inaccessible to hospital patients, the CMS Regional Office makes a determination.
