(ii) At the time of any reconciliation under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, outlier payments may be adjusted to account for the time value of any underpayments or overpayments. Any adjustment will be based on a widely available index to be established in advance by CMS, and will be applied from the midpoint of the cost reporting period to the date of reconciliation.
