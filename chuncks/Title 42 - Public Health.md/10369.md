() In general, the current period defined benefit cost and limit is computed and applied separately for each QDBP or funded NQDB offered by a provider of services. In the case of a plan merger, the contributions or payments made by a provider of services to a predecessor QDBP or funded NQDB and reflected in the assets subsequently transferred to a successor plan are treated as contribution payments made to the successor plan.
