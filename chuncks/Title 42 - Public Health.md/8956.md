() For fiscal year 2024 and subsequent fiscal years, for all eligible hospitals, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on data on uncompensated care costs, defined as charity care costs plus non-Medicare and non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt costs from cost reports from the three most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted. If a hospital is a new hospital (that is, a hospital that began participation in the Medicare program after the three most recent cost reporting years for which audits have been conducted) or if the hospital is treated as a new hospital for purposes of Factor 3, the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) will determine Factor 3 as the ratio of the hospital's uncompensated care costs from its cost report for the applicable fiscal year to the sum of uncompensated care costs for all disproportionate share hospital (DSH)-eligible hospitals as estimated by CMS from the most recent cost reporting year for which audits have been conducted.
