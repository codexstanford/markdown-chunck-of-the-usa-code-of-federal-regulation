(a) The State Medicaid agency may appeal (to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR part 16) a disallowance concerning a reduction in FFP claimed for system operations caused by a disapproval of the State's system.

(b) The decisions concerning whether to restore any FFP retroactively and the actual number of quarters for which FFP will be restored under ยง 433.122 of this subpart are not subject to administrative appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR part 16.

(c) An agency's request for a reconsideration before the Board under paragraph (a) of this section does not delay implementation of the reduction in FFP. However, any reduction is subject to retroactive adjustment if required by the Board's determination on reconsideration.
