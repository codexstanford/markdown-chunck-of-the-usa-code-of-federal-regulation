####### Via Claims.

(i)For the 12-month 2014 PQRS incentive reporting period-

(A) Report at least 9 measures covering at least 3 National Quality Strategy domains, and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies; or if less than 9 measures covering at least 3 National Quality Strategy domains apply to the eligible professional, report 1 to 8 measures covering 1 to 3 National Quality Strategy domains and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. For an eligible professional who reports fewer than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains via the claims-based reporting mechanism, the eligible professional would be subject to the Measures Applicability Validation process, which would allow us to determine whether an eligible professional should have reported quality data codes for additional measures and/or covering additional National Quality Strategy domains. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted.

(B) [Reserved]
