####### General rule: Determination of substantial financial risk.

(e)Substantial financial risk occurs when the incentive arrangements place the physician or physician group at risk for amounts beyond the risk threshold, if the risk is based on the use or costs of referral services. Amounts at risk based solely on factors other than a physician's or physician group's referral levels do not contribute to the determination of substantial financial risk. The risk threshold is 25 percent.
