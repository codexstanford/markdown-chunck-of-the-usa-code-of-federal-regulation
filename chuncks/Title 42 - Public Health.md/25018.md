####### General.

(a)A complete SNF/ICF facility survey consists of three components:

- Life Safety Code requirements;

- Administrative and structural requirements (Part A of the Survey Report, Form CMS-525); and

- Direct resident care requirements (Part B of the Survey Report, Form CMS-519), along with the related worksheets (CMS-520 through 524).

Use this survey process for all surveys of SNFs and ICFs-whether freestanding, distinct parts, or dually certified. Do not use this process for surveys of Intermediate Care Facilities for Mentally Retarded (ICFs/IID), swing-bed hospitals or skilled nursing sections of hospitals that are not separately certified as SNF distinct parts. Do not announce SNF/ICF surveys ahead of time.
