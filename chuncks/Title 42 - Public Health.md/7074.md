####### Enrollee responsibilities.

(a)(1) The enrollee is still responsible for premium payments; the group payer simply acts as his agent. If the agent fails to pay, or identifies the payment incorrectly, SSA notifies both the agent and the enrollee that the enrollee's account is delinquent. If an enrollee fails to take action on that notice, entitlement is terminated for nonpayment of premiums.

(2) The enrollee must promptly notify both SSA and the group payer of any change of address.
