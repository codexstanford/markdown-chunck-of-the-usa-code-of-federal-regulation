(3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, if a long-term care hospital's discharge payment percentage for the cost reporting period is not at least 50 percent, discharges in all cost reporting periods beginning after the notification described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be paid under the payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section until reinstated under paragraph (d)(5) or (6) of this section.

(4) For cost reporting periods subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the payment for all discharges consists of-

(ii) If applicable, an additional payment for high cost outlier cases based on the fixed-loss amount established for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system in effect at the time of the LTCH discharge.

(5) For full reinstatement-

(i) When the discharge payment percentage for a cost reporting period is calculated to be at least 50 percent, any payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section will be discontinued for cost reporting periods beginning on or after the notification described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(ii) A long-term care hospital reinstated under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section will be subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section if, after being reinstated, it again meets the criteria in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(6) For special probationary reinstatement-

(i) A hospital that would be subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section for a cost reporting period will have application of the payment adjustment delayed for that period if, for the period of at least 5 consecutive months of the 6 months immediately preceding the cost reporting period, the discharge payment percentage is calculated to be at least 50 percent.

(ii) For any cost reporting period to which the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section would have applied but for a delay under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section will be applied to all discharges in the cost reporting period if the discharge payment percentage for the cost reporting period is not calculated to be at least 50 percent.
