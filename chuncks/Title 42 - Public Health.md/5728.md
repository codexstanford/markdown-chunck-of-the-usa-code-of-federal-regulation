(c) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a provider of services or other person must, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be deemed to be without fault if the determination of the carrier, the intermediary, or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that more than the correct amount was paid was made subsequent to the fifth year following the year in which notice was sent to such individual that such amount had been paid.
