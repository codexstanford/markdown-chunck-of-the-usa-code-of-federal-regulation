####### Update factor

is the decimal equivalent of the rate-of-increase percentage. The update factor is the value by which a hospital's target amount for the preceding year is multiplied in order to determine the target amount for the following year. For example, if the rate-of-increase percentage for a year is 2.7 percent, the update factor for that year is 1.027.
