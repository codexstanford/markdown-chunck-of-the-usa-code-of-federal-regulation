(h)-(1)Upon completing its evaluation, CMS decides whether to adopt a suggestion. If CMS receives the same or an overlapping suggestion from two or more unrelated parties, CMS will consider a reward only for the suggestion CMS received first, if the suggestion or overlapping part of the suggestion are identical, and CMS has adopted that part. If the suggestions are not identical, CMS will consider rewarding the suggestion received first, if it is feasible and CMS is able to adopt and implement the suggestion. If the first suggestion cannot be implemented, CMS may consider rewarding the suggestion received next, even if it is similar, provided CMS can adopt and implement the suggestion.
