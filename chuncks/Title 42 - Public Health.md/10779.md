###### ยง 413.337 Methodology for calculating the prospective payment rates.
####### Data used.

(a)(1) To calculate the prospective payment rates, CMS uses-

(i) Medicare data on allowable costs from freestanding and hospital-based SNFs for cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 1995. SNFs that received "new provider" exemptions under ยง 413.30(e)(2) are excluded from the data base used to compute the Federal payment rates. In addition, allowable costs related to exceptions payments under ยง 413.30(f) are excluded from the data base used to compute the Federal payment rates;

(ii) An appropriate wage index to adjust for area wage differences;

(iii) The most recent projections of increases in the costs from the SNF market basket index;

(iv) Resident assessment and other data that account for the relative resource utilization of different resident types; and

(v) Medicare Part B SNF claims data reflecting amounts payable under Part B for covered SNF services (other than those services described in ยง 411.15(p)(2) of this chapter) furnished during SNF cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 1995 to individuals who were residents of SNFs and receiving Part A covered services.
