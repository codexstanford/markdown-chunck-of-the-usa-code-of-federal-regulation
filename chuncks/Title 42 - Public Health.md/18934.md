###### § 426.425 LCD review.
####### ALJ evaluation.

(c)(1) After the aggrieved party files a statement and the contractor responds, as described in § 426.425(a) and § 426.425(b), or the time for filing has expired, the ALJ applies the reasonableness standard to determine whether the LCD record is complete and adequate to support the validity of the LCD.

(2) Issuance of a decision finding the record complete and adequate to support the validity of the LCD ends the review process.

(3) If the ALJ determines that the LCD record is not complete and adequate to support the validity of the LCD, the ALJ permits discovery and the taking of evidence in accordance with §§ 426.432 and 426.440 and evaluates the LCD in accordance with § 426.431.

(d) The process described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section applies when an LCD record has been supplemented, except that discovery and the taking of evidence are not repeated. The period for the aggrieved party to file a statement begins when the aggrieved party receives the supplement.
