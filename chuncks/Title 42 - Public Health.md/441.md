###### Determination of Estimated Requirement for Optometric Visits.

2.

The number of optometric visits required by an area's population will be estimated by multiplying each of the following visit rates by the size of the population within that particular age group and then adding the figures obtained together.

For geographic areas where the age distribution of the population is not known, it will be assumed that the percentage distribution, by age groups, for the area is the same as the distribution for the county of which it is a part.
