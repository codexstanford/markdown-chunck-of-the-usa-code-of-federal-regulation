####### Adjusting cost.

(2)Program reimbursement for the costs to which limits imposed under ยง 413.30 are applied in any cost reporting period will not exceed the lesser of the provider's actual cost or the limits imposed under ยง 413.30. If program reimbursement for items or services to which such limits are applied plus the charges to beneficiaries for such items or services imposed under this section exceed the provider's actual cost for such items or services, program payment to the provider will be reduced to the extent program payment plus charges to the beneficiaries exceed actual cost. If the provider's actual cost for general routine services in 1975 was $57,000, the cost limit was $58,000, and billed charges to Medicare Part A beneficiaries were $2,000, the provider would receive $55,000 from the program ($57,000 actual cost minus the $2,000 in charges to the beneficiaries).
