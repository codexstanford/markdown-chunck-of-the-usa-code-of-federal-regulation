####### Use of appropriate and consensus-based quality measures.

(f)For measures selected for inclusion in the PQRS quality measure set, CMS will use group practice measures determined appropriate by CMS and consensus-based quality measures that meet one of the following criteria:

(1) Be such measures selected by the Secretary from measures that have been endorsed by the entity with a contract with the Secretary under section 1890(a) of the Act. In the case of a specified area or medical topic determined appropriate by the Secretary for which a feasible and practical measure has not been endorsed by the entity with a contract under section 1890(a) of the Act, the Secretary may specify a measure that is not so endorsed as long as due consideration is given to measures that have been endorsed or adopted by a consensus organization identified by the Secretary.

(2) For each quality measure adopted by the Secretary under this paragraph, the Secretary ensures that eligible professionals have the opportunity to provide input during the development, endorsement, or selection of quality measures applicable to services they furnish.
