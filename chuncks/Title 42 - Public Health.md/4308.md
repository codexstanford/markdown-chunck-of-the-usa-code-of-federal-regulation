####### Calculation and adjustment of excess.

(2)(i) The amount of an excess in uncompensated services in any fiscal year is the difference between the amount of uncompensated services the facility provided in that year and the facility's annual compliance level for that year.

(ii) The amount of any excess compliance applied to reduce a facility's annual compliance level must be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility provided the excess, and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility applies the excess to reduce its annual compliance level or satisfy its remaining obligation.

(3) Except as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a facility assisted under title VI may in any fiscal year apply the amount of excess credited under this paragraph to satisfy the remainder of its obligation to provide uncompensated services. A facility's remaining obligation is determined as follows:

(i) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the remaining obligation is:

(A) For grant assistance, 10 percent of each grant under obligation, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, adjusted as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, plus any deficits required to be made up and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; and

(B) For loan assistance, the facility's annual compliance level multiplied by the number of years remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus the sum of 10 percent of each yearly cumulative total of additional interest subsidy or other payments (which the Secretary will have made in connection with the guaranteed loan or a direct loan which has been sold) in each subsequent year remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus any deficits required to be made up, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; or

(ii) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining obligation is the average of the facility's annual compliance levels in the previous three years, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, plus any deficits required to be made up under this section, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years.
