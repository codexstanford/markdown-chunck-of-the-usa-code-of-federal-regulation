####### Principles.

(a)(1) Compensation paid by an HMO or CMP to physicians is an allowable cost to the extent that it is commensurate with the compensation paid for similar services performed by similar physicians practicing in the same or a similar locality.

(2) Physician compensation may take various forms, but the aggregate compensation allowable must be reasonable in relation to the services personally furnished.

(3) If aggregate physician compensation costs exceed what is normally incurred, the excess is not a reasonable cost.
