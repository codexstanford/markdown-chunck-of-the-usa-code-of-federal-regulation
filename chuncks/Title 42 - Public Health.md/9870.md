####### Reimbursement effects of contractor's determination of whether there is an appropriate cost report claim

(4). If the contractor determines that the provider's cost report included an appropriate claim for a specific item (as specified in paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (3) of this section) and that all the other substantive reimbursement requirements for the specific item are also satisfied, the final contractor determination (as defined in ยง 405.1801(a) of this chapter) must include reimbursement for the specific item to the extent permitted by Medicare policy. If the contractor determines that the provider made an appropriate cost report claim for a specific item but the contractor disagrees with material aspects of the provider's claim for the specific item, the contractor must make appropriate adjustments to the provider's cost report and include reimbursement for the specific item in the final contractor determination in accordance with such cost report adjustments and to the extent permitted by program policy. If the contractor determines that the provider did not make an appropriate cost report claim for a specific item, the final contractor determination must not include any reimbursement for the specific item, regardless of whether the other substantive reimbursement requirements for the specific item are or are not satisfied.
