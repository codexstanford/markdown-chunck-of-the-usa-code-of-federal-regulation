####### Exception requests.

(f)(1) An MA plan may request an exception to network adequacy criteria in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section when both of the following occur:

(i) Certain providers or facilities are not available for the MA plan to meet the network adequacy criteria as shown in the Provider Supply file for the year for a given county and specialty type.

(ii) The MA plan has contracted with other providers and facilities that may be located beyond the limits in the time and distance criteria, but are currently available and accessible to most enrollees, consistent with the local pattern of care.

(2) In evaluating exception requests, CMS considers whether-

(i) The current access to providers and facilities is different from the HSD reference and Provider Supply files for the year;

(ii) There are other factors present, in accordance with ยง 422.112(a)(10)(v), that demonstrate that network access is consistent with or better than the original Medicare pattern of care; and

(iii) Approval of the exception is in the best interests of beneficiaries.
