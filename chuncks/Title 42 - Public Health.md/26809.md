###### ยง 495.22 Meaningful use objectives and measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs for 2015 through 2018.
####### Many of the objectives and associated measures in paragraph (e) of this section rely on measures that count unique patients or actions.

(d)(1) If a measure (or associated objective) in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section references this paragraph (d), the measure may be calculated by reviewing only the actions for patients whose records are maintained using CEHRT. A patient's record is maintained using CEHRT if sufficient data were entered in the CEHRT to allow the record to be saved, and not rejected due to incomplete data.

(2) If the objective and associated measure does not reference this paragraph (d) of this section, then the measure must be calculated by reviewing all patient records, not just those maintained using CEHRT.
