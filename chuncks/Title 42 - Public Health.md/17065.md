(5)-(i)Sponsors of group health plans that provide benefits through health insurance coverage (as defined in 45 CFR 144.103) and that choose either monthly payments, quarterly payments or an interim annual payment in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, may elect to determine gross covered plan-related retiree prescription drug costs for purposes of the monthly, quarterly or interim annual payments based on a portion of the premium costs paid by the sponsor (or by the qualifying covered retirees) for coverage of the covered retirees under the group health plan. Premium costs that are determined, using generally accepted actuarial principles, may be attributable to the gross covered plan-related retiree prescription drug costs incurred by the health insurance issuer (as defined in 45 CFR 144.103) for the sponsor's qualifying covered retirees, except that administrative costs and risk charges must be subtracted from the premium.
