A State plan must include a description of-

(a) The extent to which, and manner in which, children in the State, including targeted low-income children and other classes of children, by income level and other relevant factors, currently have creditable health coverage (as defined in § 457.10) and, if sufficient information is available, whether the creditable health coverage they have is under public health insurance programs or health insurance programs that involve public-private partnerships;

(b) Current State efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uncovered children, including the steps the State is taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs and health insurance programs that involve public-private partnerships; and

(c) Procedures the State uses to accomplish coordination of CHIP with other public and private health insurance programs, sources of health benefits coverage for children, and relevant child health programs, such as title V, that provide health care services for low-income children. Such procedures include those designed to-

(1) Increase the number of children with creditable health coverage;

(2) Assist in the enrollment in CHIP of children determined ineligible for Medicaid; and

(3) Ensure coordination with other insurance affordability programs in the determination of eligibility and enrollment in coverage to ensure that all eligible individuals are enrolled in the appropriate program, including through use of the procedures described in §§ 457.305, 457.348 and 457.350 of this part.
