####### Limitations on group appeals.

(f)(1) After the date of receipt by the Board of a group appeal hearing request under paragraph (c) of this section, a provider may not add other questions of fact or law to the appeal, regardless of whether the question is common to other members of the appeal (as described in ยง 405.1837(a)(2) and (g) of this subpart).

(i) The Board must determine whether the appeal involves specific matters at issue that raise more than one factual or legal question common to each provider; and

(ii) When the appeal is found to involve more than one factual or legal question common to each provider, the Board must assign a separate case number to the appeal of each common factual or legal question and conduct further proceedings in the various appeals separately for each case.
