###### To what type of outside review or inspection will the federally supported sanctuary be subjected?

(b)As noted in paragraph (a) of this section, the contractor for the sanctuary will be monitored on a regularly scheduled basis by representatives of ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH/HHS . The ORIP/DPCPSI representative will use facility site visits, reports, personal contact, and any other means as appropriate to ensure compliance with these standards. The contractor and subcontractors are required to obtain and maintain an Animal Welfare Assurance from NIH's Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) when chimpanzees are used for noninvasive studies as authorized in the CHIMP Act. In addition, the sanctuary must achieve accreditation by a nationally recognized animal program accrediting body (such as the AAALAC, the AZA, or similar recognized body) within a time frame to be determined by ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH . The federally supported sanctuary must comply with the requirements set forth in the Animal Welfare Regulations (9 CFR parts 1 through 3).
