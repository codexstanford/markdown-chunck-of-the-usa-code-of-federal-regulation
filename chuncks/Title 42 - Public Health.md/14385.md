####### By customization.

(3)When necessary due to utilization or supply patterns, CMS may set maximum time and distance standards for provider or facility types for specific counties by customization in accordance with the following rules:

(i) CMS maps provider location data from the Provider Supply file against its MA Medicare Sample Census (which provides MA enrollee population distribution data) or uses claims data to identify the distances beneficiaries travel according to the usual patterns of care for the county.

(ii) CMS identifies the distance at which 90 percent of the population would have access to at least one provider or facility in the applicable specialty type.

(iii) The resulting distance is then rounded up to the next multiple of 5, and a multiplier specific to the county designation is applied to determine the analogous maximum time.

(iv) Customization may only be used to increase the base time and distance standards specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and may not be used to decrease the base time and distance standards.
