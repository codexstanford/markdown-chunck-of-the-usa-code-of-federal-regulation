####### Non-patient facing MIPS eligible clinician

means:

(1) For the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment year, an individual MIPS eligible clinician who bills 100 or fewer patient facing encounters (including Medicare telehealth services defined in section 1834(m) of the Act), as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, during the non-patient facing determination period described in paragraph (4) of this definition, and a group or virtual group provided that more than 75 percent of the NPIs billing under the group's TIN or virtual group's TINs, as applicable, meet the definition of a non-patient facing individual MIPS eligible clinician.

(2) Beginning with the 2021 MIPS payment year, an individual MIPS eligible clinician who bills 100 or fewer patient facing encounters (including Medicare telehealth services defined in section 1834(m) of the Act), as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, during the MIPS determination period, and a group or virtual group provided that more than 75 percent of the NPIs billing under the group's TIN or virtual group's TINs, as applicable, meet the definition of a non-patient facing individual MIPS eligible clinician.

(3) For purposes of this definition, a patient-facing encounter is an instance in which the individual MIPS eligible clinician or group bills for items and services furnished such as general office visits, outpatient visits, and procedure codes under the PFS, as specified by CMS.

(4) For the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment year, the non-patient facing determination period is a 24-month assessment period consisting of:

(i) An initial 12-month segment that spans from the last 4 months of the calendar year 2 years prior to the performance period through the first 8 months of the calendar year preceding the performance period; and

(ii) A second 12-month segment that spans from the last 4 months of the calendar year 1 year prior to the performance period through the first 8 months of the calendar year performance period. An individual eligible MIPS clinician, group, or virtual group that is identified as non-patient facing during the initial 12-month segment will continue to be considered non-patient facing for the applicable year regardless of the results of the second 12-month segment analysis. For the 2019 MIPS payment year, each segment of the non-patient facing determination period includes a 60-day claims run out. For the 2020 MIPS payment year and future years, each segment of the non-patient facing determination period includes a 30-day claims run out.
