####### Example.

(f)Peter M enrolled during his initial enrollment period, terminated his first coverage period in August 1979 and reenrolled for the first time in January 1980. The 7 months to be counted (September 1979 through March, 1980) were not enough to require any increase in the premium. Peter terminated his second period of coverage in February 1981 and reenrolled for the second time in July 1981. Since the 4 months (April through July 1981), when added to the previous 7 months, bring the total to only 11 months, no premium increase is required.
