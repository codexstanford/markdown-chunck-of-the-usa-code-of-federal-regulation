####### Adjusting for different area wage levels.

(x)(1) CMS adjusts the proportion (as estimated by CMS from time to time) of Federal rates for inpatient operating costs computed under paragraph (j) of this section that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs. The wage index is updated annually.

(2)(i) CMS makes a midyear correction to the wage index for an area only if a hospital can show that-

(A) The intermediary or CMS made an error in tabulating its data; and

(B) The hospital could not have known about the error, or did not have the opportunity to correct the error, before the beginning of the Federal fiscal year.

(ii) A midyear correction to the wage index is effective prospectively from the date the change is made to the wage index.

(3) If a judicial decision reverses a CMS denial of a hospital's wage data revision request, CMS pays the hospital by applying a revised wage index that reflects the revised wage data as if CMS's decision had been favorable rather than unfavorable.
