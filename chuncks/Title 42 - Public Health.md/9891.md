####### Identification of charges to individual.

(e)For purposes of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a provider must give or send to the individual or his representative, a schedule of all items and services that the individual might need and for which the provider imposes charges under this section, and the charge for each. Such schedule must specify that the charges are necessary to meet the costs in excess of the costs determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services under Medicare and include such other information as CMS considers necessary to protect the individual's rights under this section. The provider, in arranging for the individual's admission, first service, or start of care, must give or send this schedule to the individual or his representative when arrangements are being made for such services or if this is not feasible, as soon thereafter as is practicable but no later than at the initiation of services.
