###### § 510.305 Determination of the NPRA and reconciliation process.
####### Calculation of the NPRA for performance years 6 through 8.

(m)By comparing the reconciliation target prices described in § 510.301 and the participant hospital's actual episode spending for the performance year and applying the adjustments in paragraph (m)(1)(vii) of this section, CMS establishes an NPRA for each participant hospital for each of performance years 6 through 8.

(1) In calculating the NPRA for each participant hospital for each performance year, CMS does the following:

(i) Determines actual episode payments for each episode included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) using claims data that is available 6 months after the end of the performance year. Actual episode payments are capped at the amount determined in accordance with § 510.300(b)(5)(ii) for the performance year, the amount determined in paragraph (k) of this section for episodes affected by extreme and uncontrollable circumstances, or the target price determined for that episode under § 510.300 for episodes that contain a COVID-19 Diagnosis Code as defined in § 510.2.

(ii) Multiplies each episode reconciliation target price by the number of episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)) to which that episode reconciliation target price applies.

(iii) Aggregates the amounts computed in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section for all episodes included in the performance year (other than episodes that have been canceled in accordance with § 510.210(b)).

(iv) Subtracts the amount determined under paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section.

(v) Performs an additional calculation using claims data available at that time, to account for any episode cancelations due to overlap between the CJR model and other CMS models and programs, or for other reasons as specified in § 510.210(b).

(vi) Conducts a post-episode spending calculation as follows: If the average post-episode Medicare Parts A and B payments for a participant hospital in the performance year being reconciled is greater than 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for that same performance year, then the spending amount exceeding 3 standard deviations above the regional average post-episode payments for the same performance year is subtracted from the net reconciliation or added to the repayment for that performance year.

(vii) Applies the following prior to determination of the reconciliation payment or repayment amount:
