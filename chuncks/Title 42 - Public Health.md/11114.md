###### ยง 414.90 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS).
####### Via Qualified Registry.

(ii)For the 12-month 2014 PQRS incentive reporting period, for a group practice of 2 or more eligible professionals, report at least 9 measures, covering at least 3 of the National Quality Strategy domains and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies; or, if less than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains apply to the group practice, then the group practice must report 1-8 measures for which there is Medicare patient data and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. For a group practice who reports fewer than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains via the qualified registry-based reporting mechanism, the group practice would be subject to the Measures Applicability Validation process, which would allow us to determine whether a group practice should have reported on additional measures and/or measures covering additional National Quality Strategy domains. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted.
