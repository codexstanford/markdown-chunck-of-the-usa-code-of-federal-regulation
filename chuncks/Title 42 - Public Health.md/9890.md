####### Definition of emergency services.

(d)For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, emergency services are those hospital services that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of the individual, and which, because of the threat to the life or health of the individual, necessitate the use of the most accessible hospital (as determined under ยง 424.106 of this chapter) available and equipped to furnish such services. If an individual has been admitted to such hospital as an inpatient because of an emergency, the emergency will be deemed to continue until it is safe from a medical standpoint to move the individual to another hospital or other institution or to discharge him.
