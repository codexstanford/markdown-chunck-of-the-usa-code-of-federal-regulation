####### Quality.

(iv)The quality performance category score is established by determining the percentile performance of the facility in the value-based purchasing program for the specified year as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and awarding a score associated with that same percentile performance in the MIPS quality performance category score for those MIPS-eligible clinicians who are not eligible to be scored using facility-based measurement for the MIPS payment year. A MIPS eligible clinician or group receiving a facility-based performance score will not earn improvement points based on prior performance in the MIPS quality performance category.
