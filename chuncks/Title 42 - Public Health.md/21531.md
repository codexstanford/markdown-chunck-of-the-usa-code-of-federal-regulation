####### Basic rules.

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, FFP in payments to an ICF/IID ends on the effective date of termination of the facility's provider agreement, or if the agreement is not terminated, on the effective date of expiration.

(2) If State law, or a Federal or State court order or injunction, requires the agency to extend the provider agreement or continue payments to a facility after the dates specified in paragraph (d) of this section, FFP is not available in those payments.
