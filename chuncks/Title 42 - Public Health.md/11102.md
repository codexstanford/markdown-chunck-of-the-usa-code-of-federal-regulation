###### ยง 414.90 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS).
####### Via Qualified Registry.

(ii)(A) For the 12-month 2014 PQRS incentive reporting period-

(1) Report at least 9 measures covering at least 3 of the National Quality Strategy domains report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies; or, if less than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains apply to the eligible professional, report 1 to 8 measures covering 1 to 3 National Quality Strategy domains for which there is Medicare patient data and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the eligible professional's Medicare Part B FFS patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. For an eligible professional who reports fewer than 9 measures covering at least 3 NQS domains via the qualified registry-based reporting mechanism, the eligible professional will be subject to the Measures Applicability Validation process, which would allow us to determine whether an eligible professional should have reported on additional measures and/or measures covering additional National Quality Strategy domains. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted.
