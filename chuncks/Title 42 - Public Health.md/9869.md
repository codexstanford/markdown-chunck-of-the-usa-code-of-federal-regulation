####### Procedures for determining whether there is an appropriate cost report claim

(3). Whether the provider's cost report for its cost reporting period includes an appropriate claim for a specific item (as prescribed in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) must be determined by reference to the cost report that the provider submits originally to, and was accepted by, the contractor for such period, provided that none of the following exceptions applies:

(i) If the provider submits an amended cost report for its cost reporting period and such amended cost report is accepted by the contractor, then whether there is an appropriate cost report claim for the specific item must be determined by reference to such amended cost report, provided that neither of the exceptions set forth in paragraphs (j)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section applies;

(ii) If the contractor adjusts the provider's cost report, as submitted originally by the provider and accepted by the contractor or as amended by the provider and accepted by the contractor, whichever is applicable, with respect to the specific item, then whether there is an appropriate cost report claim for the specific item must be determined by reference to the provider's cost report, as such cost report claim is adjusted for the specific item in the final contractor determination (as defined in ยง 405.1801(a) of this chapter) for the provider's cost reporting period, provided that the exception set forth in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section does not apply;

(iii) If the contractor reopens either the final contractor determination for the provider's cost reporting period (pursuant to ยง 405.1885 of this chapter) or a revised final contractor determination for such period (issued pursuant to ยง 405.1889 of this chapter) and the contractor adjusts the provider's cost report with respect to the specific item, then whether there is an appropriate cost report claim for the specific item must be determined by reference to the provider's cost report, as such cost report claim is adjusted for the specific item in the most recent revised final contractor determination for such period.
