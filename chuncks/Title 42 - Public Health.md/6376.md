####### Right to hearing based on untimely contractor determination.

(c)Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a provider (but no other individual, entity, or party) has a right to a contractor hearing, as a single provider appeal, for specific items for a cost reporting period if-

(1) A final contractor determination for the provider's cost reporting period is not issued (through no fault of the provider) within 12 months after the date of receipt by the contractor of the provider's perfected cost report or amended cost report (as specified in ยง 413.24(f) of this chapter). The date of receipt by the contractor of the provider's perfected cost report or amended cost report is presumed to be the date of electronic delivery, or the date the contractor stamped "Received" on such cost report unless it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the contractor received the cost report on an earlier date.

(2) Unless the provider qualifies for a good cause extension under ยง 405.1813, the date of receipt by the contractor of the provider's hearing request is no later than 180 days after the expiration of the 12 month period for issuance of the final contractor determination (as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section); and

(3) The amount in controversy (as determined in accordance with ยง 405.1839) is at least $1,000 but less than $10,000.
