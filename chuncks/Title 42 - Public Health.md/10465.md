###### ยง 413.134 Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation based on asset costs.
####### Principle.

(a)An appropriate allowance for depreciation on buildings and equipment used in the provision of patient care is an allowable cost. The depreciation must be-

(1) Identifiable and recorded in the provider's accounting records;

(2) Based on the historical cost of the asset, except as specified in paragraph (j) of this section regarding donated assets; and

(3) Prorated over the estimated useful life of the asset using-

(i) The straight-line method; or

(ii) Accelerated depreciation under a declining balance method (not to exceed double the straight-line rate) or the sum-of-the-years' digits method in the following situations:

(A) Depreciable assets for which accelerated depreciation was used for Medicare purposes before August 1, 1970, including those assets for which a timely request to change from straight-line depreciation to accelerated depreciation was received by an contractor before August 1, 1970;

(B) Depreciable assets acquired before August 1, 1970, if no election to use straight-line or accelerated depreciation was in effect on August 1, 1970, and the provider was participating in the program on August 1, 1970;

(C) Depreciable assets of a provider if construction of such depreciable asset began before February 5, 1970, and the provider was participating in the program on February 5, 1970; or

(D) Depreciable assets of a provider if a valid written contract was entered into by a provider participating in the program before February 5, 1970, for construction, acquisition, or for the permanent financing thereof, and such contract was binding on a provider on February 5, 1970, and at all times thereafter; or

(iii) A declining balance method, not to exceed 150 percent of the straight-line rate, for a depreciable asset acquired after July 31, 1970; however, this declining balance method may be used only if the cash flow from depreciation on the total assets of the institution during the reporting period, including straight-line depreciation on the assets in question, is insufficient (assuming funding of available capital not required currently for amortization and assuming reasonable interest income on such funds) to supply the funds required to meet the reasonable principal amortization schedules on the capital debts related to the provider's total depreciable assets. For each depreciable asset for which a provider requests authorization to use a declining balance method for Medicare reimbursement purposes, but not to exceed 150 percent of the straight-line rate, the provider must demonstrate to the contractor's satisfaction that the required cash flow need exists. For each depreciable asset in which a provider justifies the use of accelerated depreciation, the contractor must give written approval for the use of a depreciation method other than straight-line before basing any interim payment on this accelerated depreciation or making its reasonable cost determination which includes an allowance for such depreciation.
