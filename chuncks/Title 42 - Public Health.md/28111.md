######## Stop-loss reconciliation amount.

(f)CMS determines the stop-loss reconciliation amount for RO participants that have fewer than 60 episodes during the baseline period and were furnishing included RT services before the start of the model performance period in the CBSAs selected for participation by-

(1) Using no-pay claims, CMS calculates the total FFS amount by summing the FFS amounts that would have been paid to the RO participant in the absence of the RO Model for all included RT services furnished during the RO episodes initiated in the PY; and

(2) CMS calculates the sum of all participant-specific professional episode payments and participant-specific technical episode payments paid to the RO participant for the RO episodes initiated in the PY.

(3) If the total FFS amount exceeds the sum of the participant-specific episode payment amounts for the PY by more than 20 percent then CMS owes the RO participant the amount that exceeds 20 percent, either increasing the amount of the RO participant's reconciliation payment or reducing the amount of the RO's participant's reconciliation repayment.
