###### § 425.656 Calculating the regional adjustment to the historical benchmark.
####### Special rules for determining the weights used in the regional adjustment calculation for a re-entering ACO.

(e)For a re-entering ACO whose prior agreement period benchmark was calculated according to § 425.603(c), CMS determines the weight used in the regional adjustment calculation described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section by considering the agreement period the ACO is entering into according to § 425.600(f) in combination with either of the following-

(1) The weight previously applied to calculate the regional adjustment to the ACO's benchmark under § 425.603(c)(9) in its most recent prior agreement period; or

(2) For a new ACO identified as a re-entering ACO, CMS considers the weight previously applied to calculate the regional adjustment to the benchmark under § 425.603(c)(9) in its most recent prior agreement period of the ACO in which the majority of the new ACO's participants were participating previously.
