######## Initial visit.

(4)(i) For each of the three categories listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, the payment amounts are set higher for the first visit by the qualified home infusion therapy supplier to initiate the furnishing of home infusion therapy services in the patient's home and lower for subsequent visits in the patient's home. The difference in payment amounts is a percentage based on the relative payment for a new patient rate over an existing patient rate using the annual physician fee schedule evaluation and management payment amounts for a given year and calculated in a budget neutral manner.

(ii) The first visit payment amount is subject to the following requirements if a patient has previously received home infusion therapy services:

(A) The previous home infusion therapy services claim must include a patient status code to indicate a discharge.

(B) If a patient has a previous claim for HIT services, the first visit home infusion therapy services claim subsequent to the previous claim must show a gap of more than 60 days between the last home infusion therapy services claim and must indicate a discharge in the previous period before a HIT supplier may submit a home infusion therapy services claim for the first visit payment amount.
