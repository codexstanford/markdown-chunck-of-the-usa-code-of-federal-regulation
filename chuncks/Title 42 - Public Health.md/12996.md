####### Selection policies.

(b)(1) Denial under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must be in accordance with written selection policies approved by CMS. (2) Enrollment of individuals will not be considered to make the enrollment of the HMO or CMP substantially nonrepresentative of the general population in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area unless, as a result of the enrollment, the proportion of the subgroup of enrollees to which the enrollee belongs as compared to the HMO's or CMP's total enrollment exceeds by at least ten percent the subgroup's proportion of the general population in the geographic area of the HMO or CMP. (A subgroup is a class of Medicare enrollees of an HMO or CMP that CMS constructs on the basis of actuarial factors.)
