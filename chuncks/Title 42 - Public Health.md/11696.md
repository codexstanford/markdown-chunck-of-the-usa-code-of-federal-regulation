If two patients are transported simultaneously, then the payment allowance for the beneficiary (or for each of them if both patients are beneficiaries) is equal to 75 percent of the service payment allowance applicable for the level of care furnished to the beneficiary, plus 50 percent of the applicable mileage payment allowance. If three or more patients are transported simultaneously, the payment allowance for the beneficiary (or each of them) is equal to 60 percent of the service payment allowance applicable for the level of care furnished to the beneficiary, plus the applicable mileage payment allowance divided by the number of patients on board.
