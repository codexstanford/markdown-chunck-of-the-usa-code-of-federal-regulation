######## Factors considered.

(g)In determining whether a claim will be compromised, or collection action terminated or suspended, CMS will consider the following factors:

(1) Age and health of the debtor, present and potential income, inheritance prospects, possible concealment or fraudulent transfer of assets, and the availability of assets which may be reached by enforced collection proceedings, for compromise under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, termination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and suspension under paragraph (f)(2) of this section;

(2) Applicable exemptions available to a debtor and uncertainty concerning the price of the property in a forced sale, for compromise under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and termination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and

(3) The probability of proving the claim in court, the probability of full or partial recovery, the availability of necessary evidence, and related pragmatic considerations, for compromise under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
