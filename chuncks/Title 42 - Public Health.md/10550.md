###### ยง 413.144 Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation on fully depreciated or partially depreciated assets.
####### Example of an allowance for a fully-depreciated asset.

(c)For example, if a 50-year-old building is in use at the time the provider enters into the program, depreciation is allowable on the building even though it has been fully depreciated on the provider's books. Assuming that a reasonable estimate of the asset's continued life is 20 years (70 years from the date of acquisition), the provider may claim depreciation over the next 20 years-if the asset is in use that long-or a total depreciation of as much as twenty-seventieths of the asset's historical cost.
