####### Application of the value-based payment modifier to participants in the Shared Savings Program.

(2)

(i) For the CY 2017 payment adjustment period and each subsequent calendar year payment adjustment period, the value-based payment modifier is applicable to physicians in groups with 2 or more eligible professionals and to physicians who are solo practitioners that participate in an ACO under the Shared Savings Program during the performance period for the payment adjustment period as described at § 414.1215. The value-based payment modifier for a group or solo practitioner that participates in an ACO under the Shared Savings Program during the performance period is determined based on paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) The cost composite is classified as "average" under § 414.1275(b).

(B) For groups and solo practitioners that participate in a Shared Savings Program ACO that successfully reports quality data as required by the Shared Savings Program under § 425.504 of this chapter, the quality composite score is calculated under § 414.1260(a) using quality data reported by the ACO for the performance period through the ACO GPRO Web interface as required under § 425.504(a)(1) of this chapter or another mechanism specified by CMS and the ACO all-cause readmission measure. Groups and solo practitioners that participate in two or more ACOs during the applicable performance period receive the quality composite score of the ACO that has the highest numerical quality composite score. For the CY 2018 payment adjustment period, the CAHPS for ACOs survey also will be included in the quality composite score. For the CY 2017 and 2018 payment adjustment periods, for groups and solo practitioners who participate in a Shared Savings Program ACO that does not successfully report quality data as required by the Shared Savings Program under § 425.504 and who meet the requirements to avoid the PQRS payment adjustment for CY 2018 by reporting to the PQRS outside the ACO, the quality composite is classified as "average" under § 414.1275(b).

(C) For the CY 2017 payment adjustment period, the value-based payment modifier adjustment will be equal to the amount determined under § 414.1275 for the payment adjustment period, except that if the ACO (or groups and solo practitioners that participate in the ACO) does not successfully report quality data as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section for the performance period, such adjustment will be equal to -4% for groups of physicians with 10 or more eligible professionals and equal to -2% for groups of physicians with two to nine eligible professionals and for physician solo practitioners. If the ACO has an assigned beneficiary population during the performance period with an average risk score in the top 25 percent of the risk scores of beneficiaries nationwide, and a group of physician or physician solo practitioner that participates in the ACO during the performance period is classified as high quality/average cost under quality-tiering for the CY 2017 payment adjustment period, the group or solo practitioner receives an upward adjustment of +3 x (rather than +2 x) if the group has 10 or more eligible professionals or +2 x (rather than +1 x) for a solo practitioner or the group has two to nine eligible professionals.

(D) For the CY 2018 payment adjustment period, the value-based payment modifier adjustment will be equal to the amount determined under § 414.1275 for the payment adjustment period, except that if the ACO (or groups and solo practitioners that participate in the ACO) does not successfully report quality data as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section for the performance period, such adjustment will be equal to the downward payment adjustment amounts described at § 414.1270(d)(1). If the ACO has an assigned beneficiary population during the performance period with an average risk score in the top 25 percent of the risk scores of beneficiaries nationwide, and a group or solo practitioner that participates in the ACO during the performance period is classified as high quality/average cost under quality-tiering for the CY 2018 payment adjustment period, the group or solo practitioner receives an upward adjustment of +3 x (rather than +2 x) if the group of physicians has 10 or more eligible professionals, +2 x (rather than +1 x) for a physician solo practitioner or if the group of physicians has two to nine eligible professionals, or +2 x (rather than +1 x) for a solo practitioner who is a nonphysician eligible professional or if the group consists of nonphysician eligible professionals.

(E) For the CY 2017 payment adjustment period and each subsequent calendar year payment adjustment period, the value-based payment modifier for groups and solo practitioners that participate in an ACO under the Shared Savings Program during the applicable performance period is determined as described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether any eligible professionals in the group or the solo practitioner also participate in an Innovation Center model during the performance period.

(F) For groups and solo practitioners that participate in a Shared Savings Program ACO that successfully reports quality data as required by the Shared Savings Program under § 425.504 of this chapter, the same value-based payment modifier adjustment will be applied in the payment adjustment period to all groups based on size as specified under § 414.1275 and solo practitioners that participated in the ACO during the performance period.

(ii) For the CY 2018 payment adjustment period and each subsequent calendar year payment adjustment period, the value-based payment modifier is applicable to nonphysician eligible professionals in groups with 2 or more eligible professionals and to nonphysician eligible professionals who are solo practitioners that participate in an ACO under the Shared Savings Program during the performance period for the payment adjustment period as described at § 414.1215. The value-based payment modifier for nonphysician eligible professionals is determined in the same manner as for physicians as described under paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
