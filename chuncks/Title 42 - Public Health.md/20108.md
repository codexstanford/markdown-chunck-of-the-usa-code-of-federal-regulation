####### ยง 435.541 Determinations of disability.
######## Periodic reexaminations.

(3)The review team must determine whether and when reexaminations will be necessary for periodic redeterminations of eligibility as required under ยง 435.916 of this part, using the principles set forth in 20 CFR 416.989 and 416.990. If a State uses the same definition of disability as SSA, as provided for under ยง 435.540, and a beneficiary is Medicaid eligible because he or she receives SSI, this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply. The reexamination will be conducted by SSA.
