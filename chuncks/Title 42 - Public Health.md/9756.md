####### Notification requirement to make election.

(2)The request by the inpatient rehabilitation facility to make the election under this paragraph (b) must be made in writing to the Medicare fiscal intermediary. The intermediary must receive the request on or before the 30th day before the applicable cost reporting period begins, regardless of any postmarks or anticipated delivery dates. Requests received, postmarked, or delivered by other means after the 30th day before the cost reporting period begins will not be approved. If the 30th day before the cost reporting period begins falls on a day that the postal service or other delivery sources are not open for business, the inpatient rehabilitation facility is responsible for allowing sufficient time for the delivery of the request before the deadline. If an inpatient rehabilitation facility's request is not received timely or is otherwise not approved, payment will be based on the transition period rate specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
