###### ยง 110.81 Calculation of benefits for lost employment income.
####### Number of lost work days.

(1)An injured countermeasure recipient will be compensated for ten or more days of work lost if he or she lost employment income for those days as a result of the covered injury (or its health complications). If the number of days of lost employment income due to the covered injury (or its health complications) is fewer than ten, the Secretary will reduce the number of lost work days by five days. If the injured countermeasure recipient lost employment income for a period of five days or fewer, no benefits for lost employment income will be paid. Lost work days do not need to be consecutive. Partial days of lost employment income may be aggregated to calculate the total number of lost work days. The Secretary has the discretion to consider the reasonableness of the number of work days (or partial work days) lost as a result of a covered injury or its health complications in this calculation, and to consider alternative work schedules in determining the number of work days lost.
