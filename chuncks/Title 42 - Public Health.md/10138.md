###### ยง 413.79 Direct GME payments: Determination of the weighted number of FTE residents.
####### Determination of the FTE resident cap.

(2)Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3) through (6) and (m) through (p) of this section and ยง 413.81, for purposes of determining direct GME payment-

(i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, a hospital's resident level may not exceed the hospital's unweighted FTE count (or, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2000, 130 percent of the unweighted FTE count for a hospital located in a rural area) for these residents for the most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.

(ii) If a hospital's number of FTE residents in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2001, exceeds the limit described in this section, the hospital's total weighted FTE count (before application of the limit) will be reduced in the same proportion that the number of FTE residents for that cost reporting period exceeds the number of FTE residents for the most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.

(iii) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001, if the hospital's unweighted number of FTE residents exceeds the limit described in this section, and the number of weighted FTE residents in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section also exceeds that limit, the respective primary care and obstetrics and gynecology weighted FTE counts and other weighted FTE counts are adjusted to make the total weighted FTE count equal the limit. If the number of FTE residents weighted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section does not exceed that limit, then the allowable weighted FTE count is the actual weighted FTE count.

(iv) Hospitals that are part of the same Medicare GME affiliated group or the same emergency Medicare GME affiliated group (as described under ยง 413.75(b)) may elect to apply the limit on an aggregate basis as described under paragraph (f) of this section.

(v) The contractor may make appropriate modifications to apply the provisions of this paragraph (c) of this section based on the equivalent of a 12-month cost reporting period.
