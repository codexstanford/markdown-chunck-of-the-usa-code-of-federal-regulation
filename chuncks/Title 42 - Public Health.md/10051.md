####### Periodic interim payments.

(d)Subject to the provisions of § 413.64(h), a CAH receiving payments under this section may elect to receive periodic interim payments (PIP) for Part A inpatient CAH services, effective for payments made on or after July l, 2004. Payment is made biweekly under the PIP method unless the CAH requests a longer fixed interval (not to exceed one month) between payments. The biweekly interim payment amount is based on the total estimated Medicare payment (after estimated beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance) for the cost reporting period. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service, as described in § 413.64(h)(6). These PIP provisions are further described in § 413.64(h)(6). Under certain circumstances that are described in § 413.64(g), a CAH that is not receiving PIP may request an accelerated payment.
