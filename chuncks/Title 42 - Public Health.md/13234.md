(b)(1) The HMO or CMP must provide adequate cost and statistical data, based on its financial and statistical records, that can be verified by qualified auditors.

(2) The cost data must be based on an approved method of cost finding and, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, on the accrual method of accounting.
