####### Statutory limitations on and preclusion of judicial review.

(c)The Act limits or precludes judicial review of certain matters at issue. Limitations on and preclusions of judicial review include the following:

(1) A finding in a contractor determination that expenses incurred for items and services furnished by a provider to an individual are not payable under title XVIII of the Act because those items or services are excluded from coverage under section 1862 of the Act, and the regulations at 42 CFR part 411, is not reviewable by the Board (as described in § 405.1840(b)(1) of this subpart) and is not subject to judicial review under section 1878(f)(1) of the Act; the finding is subject to judicial review solely in accordance with the applicable provisions of sections 1155, 1869, and 1879(d) of the Act, and of subpart I of part 405 and subpart B of part 478, as applicable.

(2) Certain matters affecting payments to hospitals under the prospective payment system are completely removed from administrative and judicial review, as provided in section 1886(d)(7) of the Act, and §§ 405.1804 and 405.1840(b)(2) of this subpart.

(3) Any Board remand order, or discovery or disclosure ruling or subpoena specified in § 405.1875(a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(ii) of this subpart, or a decision by the Administrator following immediate review of a Board remand order, discovery ruling, or subpoena, is not subject to immediate judicial review under section 1878(f)(1) of the Act. Judicial review of all nonfinal Board actions, including any such Board remand order, discovery or disclosure ruling, or subpoena (except as provided in § 405.1857(e) of this subpart), is limited to review of a final agency decision as described in § 405.1877(a) of this subpart.
