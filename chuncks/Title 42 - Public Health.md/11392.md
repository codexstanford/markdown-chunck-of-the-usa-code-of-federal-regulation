(b)The procedures for determining whether new items and services addressed in a request for a HCPCS Level II code(s) or by other means meet the definition of items and services paid for in accordance with this subpart are as follows:

(1) At the start of a HCPCS coding cycle, CMS performs an analysis to determine if the item or service is statutorily excluded from coverage under Medicare under section 1862 of the Act, and, if not excluded by statute, whether the item or service is durable medical equipment, a prosthetic device as further defined under section 1834(h)(4) of the Act, an orthotic or prosthetic, a surgical dressing, or a therapeutic shoe or insert.

(2) If a preliminary determination is made that the item or service is durable medical equipment, a prosthetic device, an orthotic or prosthetic, a surgical dressing, or a therapeutic shoe or insert, CMS makes a preliminary payment determination for the item or service.
