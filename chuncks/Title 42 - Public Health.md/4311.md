###### ยง 124.504 Notice of availability of uncompensated services.
####### Individual written notice.

(c)(1) In any period during a fiscal year in which uncompensated services are available in the facility, the facility shall provide individual written notice of the availability of uncompensated services to each person who seeks services in the facility on behalf of himself or another. The individual written notice must:

(i) State that the facility is required by law to provide a reasonable amount of care without or below charge to people who cannot afford care;

(ii) Set forth the criteria the facility uses for determining eligibility for uncompensated services (in accordance with the financial eligibility criteria and the allocation plan);

(iii) State the location in the facility where anyone seeking uncompensated services may request them; and

(iv) State that the facility will make a written determination of whether the person will receive uncompensated services, and the date by or period within which the determination will be made.

(2) The facility shall provide the individual written notice before providing services, except where the emergency nature of the services provided makes prior notice impractical. If this exception applies, the facility shall provide the individual written notice to the next of kin or to the patient as soon as practical, but not later than when first presenting a bill for services.

(3) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the contents of the individual written notice to persons who it has reason to believe cannot read the notice.
