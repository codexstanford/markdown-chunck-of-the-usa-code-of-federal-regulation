(1)The contractor makes a recommendation on the HHA's request to CMS, which makes the decision. CMS responds to the request within 180 days from the date CMS receives the request from the contractor. The contractor notifies the HHA of CMS's decision. The time required by CMS to review the request is considered good cause for the granting of an extension of the time limit for requesting an contractor hearing or a Provider Reimbursement Review Board (Board) hearing as specified in §§ 405.1813 and 405.1836 of this chapter, respectively.
