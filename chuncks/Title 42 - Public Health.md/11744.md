####### Example.

(iv)After adjusting for exempted sales, the total lagged price concessions (discounts, rebates, etc.) over the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales for National Drug Code 12345-6789-01 subject to the ASP reporting requirement equal $200,000, and the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the same period equals $600,000. The lagged price concessions percentage for this period equals 200,000/600,000 = 0.33333. The total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the quarter being reported, equals $50,000 for 10,000 units sold. The manufacturer's average sales price calculation for this National Drug Code for this quarter is: $50,000-(0.33333 x $50,000) = $33,334 (net total sales amount); $33,334/10,000 = $3.33 (average sales price).
