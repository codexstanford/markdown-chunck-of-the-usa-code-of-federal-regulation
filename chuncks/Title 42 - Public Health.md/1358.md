####### Notification.

(c)NIOSH will notify the miner when he or she is due to receive the second or third mandatory test under paragraph (b) of this section. NIOSH will notify the coal mine operator when the miner is to perform a second spirometry test.

(1) The operator will be notified of a miner's eligibility for a third test only with the miner's written consent. The notice to the operator will not state the medical reason for the test or that it is the third test in the series.

(2) If the miner is notified by NIOSH that the third mandatory test is due and the operator is not so notified, availability of spirometry testing under the NIOSH-approved operator's plan will constitute the operator's compliance with the requirement to provide a third spirometry test even if the miner does not take the test.
