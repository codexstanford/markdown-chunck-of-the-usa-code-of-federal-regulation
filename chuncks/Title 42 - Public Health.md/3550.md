(b)The respirator manufacturer, as part of the application for certification, must specify the filter series and the filter efficiency level ("N95," "R95," "P95," "N99," "R99," "P99," "N100," "R100," "P100," "HE," "PAPR100-N" or "PAPR100-P") for which certification is being sought.

(1) Filters for non-powered respirators (series N, R, and P) must be prominently labeled as follows:

(i) N100 filters must be labeled "N100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(ii) R100 filters must be labeled "R100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(iii) P100 filters must be labeled "P100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be color coded magenta.

(iv) N99 filters must be labeled "N99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(v) R99 filters must be labeled "R99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(vi) P99 filters must be labeled "P99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(vii) N95 filters must be labeled as "N95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(viii) R95 filters must be labeled as "R95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(ix) P95 filters must be labeled as "P95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)" and must be a color other than magenta.

(2) Filters for powered respirators (classes HE and PAPR100) must be prominently labeled as follows:

(i) HE filters must be labeled as "HE Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be color coded magenta.

(ii) PAPR100-N filters must be labeled as "PAPR100-N Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be color coded magenta.

(iii) PAPR100-P filters must be labeled as "PAPR100-P Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)" and must be color coded magenta.
