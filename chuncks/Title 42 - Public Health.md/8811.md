(1)CMS sets forth national and regional case-mix index values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates published under ยง 412.8(b). The methodology CMS uses to calculate these criteria is described in paragraph (h) of this section.

The hospital's case-mix index for discharges (not including discharges from units excluded from the prospective payment system under subpart B of this part) during the same Federal fiscal year used to compute the case mix index values under paragraph (h) of this section must be at least equal to-

(ii) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost-reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, the national case-mix index value as established by CMS or the median case-mix index value for urban hospitals located in each region. In calculating the median case-mix index for each region, CMS excludes the case-mix indexes of hospitals receiving indirect medical education payments as provided in ยง 412.105.
