####### Reconciliation of State proportions.

(ii)If, after the application of the floors and ceilings in paragraph (e)(3)(i), the sum of the States' proportions is not equal to one, the Secretary will reconcile the States' proportions by applying either paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this paragraph, as appropriate, such that the sum of the proportions after reconciliation equals one. If, after the application of the floors and ceilings in paragraph (e)(3)(i), the sum of the States' proportions is equal to one, no reconciliation is necessary, and the States' proportions will be the same as the preadjusted proportions determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(A) If, after the application of the floors and ceilings under paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, the sum of the States' proportions is greater than one, the Secretary will establish a maximum percentage increase in States' proportions, such that when applied to the States' proportions, the sum of the proportions is exactly equal to one.

(B) If, after the application of the floors and ceilings under paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B), the sum of the proportions is less than one, the Secretary will increase States' proportions (as computed before the application of the floors under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)) in a pro rata manner (but not to exceed the 145 percent ceiling computed under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B)), such that when applied to the States' proportions, the sum of the proportions is exactly equal to one.
