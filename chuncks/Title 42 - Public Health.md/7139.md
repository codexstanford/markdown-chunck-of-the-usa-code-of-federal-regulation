###### § 409.20 Coverage of services.
####### Services not generally provided by (or under arrangements made by) SNFs.

(2)Except as specifically listed in §§ 409.21 through 409.27, only those services generally provided by (or under arrangements made by) SNFs are considered as posthospital SNF care. For example, a type of medical or surgical procedure that is ordinarily performed only on an inpatient basis in a hospital is not included as "posthospital SNF care," because such procedures are not generally provided by (or under arrangements made by) SNFs.
