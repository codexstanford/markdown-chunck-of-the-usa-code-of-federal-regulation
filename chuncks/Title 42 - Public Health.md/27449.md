###### ยง 495.306 Establishing patient volume.
####### Group practices.

(h)Clinics or group practices will be permitted to calculate patient volume at the group practice/clinic level, but only in accordance with all of the following limitations:

(1) The clinic or group practice's patient volume is appropriate as a patient volume methodology calculation for the EP.

(2) There is an auditable data source to support the clinic's or group practice's patient volume determination.

(3) All EPs in the group practice or clinic must use the same methodology for the payment year.

(4) The clinic or group practice uses the entire practice or clinic's patient volume and does not limit patient volume in any way.

(5) If an EP works inside and outside of the clinic or practice, then the patient volume calculation includes only those encounters associated with the clinic or group practice, and not the EP's outside encounters.
