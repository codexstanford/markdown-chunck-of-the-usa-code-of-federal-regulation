(2)The base payment rate for the applicable type of air ambulance service is adjusted by the GAF and, when applicable, by the appropriate RAF to determine the amount of payment. Air ambulance services have no CF or RVUs. This amount is compared to the actual charge. The lesser of the charge or the adjusted GAF rate amount is added to the payment rate per mile, multiplied by the number of miles that the beneficiary was transported. When applicable, the appropriate RAF is also applied to the air mileage rate.
