###### ยง 411.161 Prohibition against taking into account Medicare eligibility or entitlement or differentiating benefits.
####### Uniform Limitations on particular services permissible.

(c)A plan is not prohibited from limiting covered utilization of a particular service as long as the limitation applies uniformly to all plan enrollees. For instance, if a plan limits its coverage of renal dialysis sessions to 30 per year for all plan enrollees, the plan would not be differentiating in the benefits it provides between plan enrollees who have ESRD and those who do not.
