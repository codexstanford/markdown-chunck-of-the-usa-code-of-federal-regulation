####### 2,IRF that closed its program.

()An IRF that agrees to train displaced residents who have been displaced by the closure of another IRF's program may receive a temporary FTE cap adjustment only if the hospital with the closed program temporarily reduces its FTE cap based on the FTE of displaced residents in each program year training in the program at the time of the programs closure. This yearly reduction in the FTE cap will be determined based on the number of those displaced residents who would have been training in the program during that year had the program not closed. No later than 60 days after the displaced residents who were in the hospital that closed its program(s) begin training at another hospital must submit to its Medicare Contractor a statement signed and dated by its representative that specifies that it agrees to the temporary reduction in its FTE cap to allow the IRF training the displaced residents to obtain a temporary adjustment to its cap; identifies the displaced residents who were in the training at the time of the program's closure; identifies the IRFs to which the displaced residents are transferring once the program closes; and specifies the reduction for the applicable program years.
