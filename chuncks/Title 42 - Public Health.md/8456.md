####### Qualifying DRGs.

(d)(1) For a fiscal year prior to FY 2006, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the qualifying DRGs must meet the following criteria for both of the 2 most recent years for which data are available:

(i) The DRG must have a geometric mean length of stay of at least 3 days.

(ii) The DRG must have at least 14,000 cases identified as postacute care transfer cases.

(iii) The DRG must have at least 10 percent of the postacute care transfers occurring before the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG.

(iv) If the DRG is one of a paired DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or complication, one of the DRGs meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

(v) To initially qualify, the DRG must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section and must have a decline in the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG during the most recent 5 years of at least 7 percent. Once a DRG initially qualifies, the DRG is subject to the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section for each subsequent fiscal year.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (c), a discharge is also considered to be a transfer if it meets the following conditions:

(i) The discharge is assigned to a DRG that contains only cases that were assigned to a DRG that qualified under this paragraph within the previous 2 years; and

(ii) The latter DRG was split or otherwise modified within the previous 2 fiscal years.

(3) For fiscal years beginning with FY 2006, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section-

(i) The qualifying DRGs must meet the following criteria using data from the March 2005 update of the FY 2004 MedPAR file and Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual (FY 2006):

(A) The DRG has at least 2,050 total postacute care transfer cases;

(B) At least 5.5 percent of the cases in the DRG are discharged to postacute care prior to the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG;

(C) The DRG must have a geometric mean length of stay greater than 3 days;

(D) The DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or complication or major cardiovascular condition that, it meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(ii) If a DRG did not exist in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual or a DRG included in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual is revised, the DRG will be a qualifying DRG if it meets the following criteria based on the version of the DRG Definitions Manual in use when the new or revised DRG first becomes effective, using the most recent complete year of MedPAR data:

(A) The total number of discharges to postacute care in the DRG must equal or exceed the 55th percentile for all DRGs;

(B) The proportion of short-stay discharges to postacute care to total discharges in the DRG exceeds the 55th percentile for all DRGs;

(C) The DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or a complication or major cardiovascular condition that meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and

(D) In the case of MS-DRGs that share the same base MS-DRG, if one MS-DRG meets the criteria specified under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, every MS-DRG that shares the same base MS-DRG is a qualifying DRG.
