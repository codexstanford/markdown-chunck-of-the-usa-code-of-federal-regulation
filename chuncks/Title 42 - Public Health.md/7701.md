(f)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), changes to the list of Medicare telehealth services are made through the annual physician fee schedule rulemaking process. During the Public Health Emergency, as defined in ยง 400.200 of this chapter, we will use a subregulatory process to modify the services included on the Medicare telehealth list during the Public Health Emergency, taking into consideration infection control, patient safety, and other public health concerns resulting from the emergency. CMS maintains the list of services that are Medicare telehealth services under this section, including the current HCPCS codes that describe the services on the CMS website.
