####### Adjustments for area wage levels.

(c)(1) The labor portion of a long-term care hospital's Federal prospective payment is adjusted to account for geographical differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index (established by CMS), which reflects the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined in accordance with the definitions set forth in ยง 412.503) of the hospital compared to the national average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs.

(i)(A) The appropriate wage index that is established by CMS is updated annually.

(B) Beginning in fiscal year 2023, if CMS determines that an LTCH's wage index value for a fiscal year would decrease by more than 5 percent as compared to the LTCH's wage index value for the prior fiscal year, CMS limits the decrease to 5 percent for the fiscal year.

(ii) The labor portion of a long-term care hospital's Federal prospective payment is established by CMS and is updated annually.

(2) Beginning in FY 2012, any adjustments or updates to the area wage level adjustment under this paragraph (c) will be made in a budget neutral manner such that estimated aggregate LTCH PPS payments are not affected.
