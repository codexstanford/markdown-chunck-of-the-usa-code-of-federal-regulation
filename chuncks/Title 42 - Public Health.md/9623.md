##### Subpart O - Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals
###### § 412.536 Special payment provisions for long-term care hospitals and satellites of long-term care hospitals that discharge Medicare patients admitted from a hospital not located in the same building or on the same campus as the long-term care hospital or satellite of the long-term care hospital, effective for discharges occurring on or before September 30, 2016 or in cost reporting periods beginning on or before June 30, 2016.
####### Special treatment of rural hospitals.

(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, in the case of a long-term care hospital or long-term care hospital satellite facility that is located in a rural area as defined in § 412.503 that has a discharged Medicare inpatient population of whom more than 50 percent were admitted to the long-term care hospital or long-term care hospital satellite facility from a hospital not co-located with the long-term care hospital or with the satellite of a long-term care hospital, payment for the Medicare discharges who are admitted from that hospital and who cause the long-term care hospital or satellite facility to exceed the 50 percent threshold for Medicare discharges is determined at the lesser of the amount otherwise payable under this subpart or the amount payable under this subpart that is equivalent, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, to the amount that is otherwise payable under subpart A, § 412.1(a). Payments for the remainder of the long-term care hospital's or long-term care hospital satellite facility's Medicare discharges admitted from that referring hospital are made under the rules in this subpart at §§ 412.500 through 412.541 with no adjustment under this section.

(2) In determining the percentage of Medicare discharges admitted from the referring hospital under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, patients on whose behalf a Medicare high cost outlier payment was made at the referring hospital are not counted toward the 50 percent threshold.
