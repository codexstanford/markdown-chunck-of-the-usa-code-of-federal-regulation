(g)The MA organization agrees to comply with the following requirements:

(1) Effective January 1, 2010, each MA organization must adopt and maintain arrangements satisfactory to CMS to protect its enrollees from incurring liability (for example, as a result of an organization's insolvency or other financial difficulties) for payment of any fees that are the legal obligation of the MA organization. To meet this requirement, the MA organization must-

(i) Ensure that all contractual or other written arrangements with providers prohibit the organization's providers from holding any enrollee liable for payment of any such fees;

(ii) Indemnify the enrollee for payment of any fees that are the legal obligation of the MA organization for services furnished by providers that do not contract, or that have not otherwise entered into an agreement with the MA organization, to provide services to the organization's enrollees; and

(iii) For all MA organizations with enrollees eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, specify in contracts with providers that such enrollees will not be held liable for Medicare Part A and B cost sharing when the State is responsible for paying such amounts, and inform providers of Medicare and Medicaid benefits, and rules for enrollees eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. The MA plans may not impose cost-sharing that exceeds the amount of cost-sharing that would be permitted with respect to the individual under title XIX if the individual were not enrolled in such a plan. The contracts must state that providers will-

(A) Accept the MA plan payment as payment in full, or

(B) Bill the appropriate State source.

(iv) Ensure that the enrollee does not have any financial liability for services, items, or drugs furnished, ordered, or prescribed to the enrollee by an MA contracted individual or entity on the preclusion list, as defined in § 422.2 and as described in § 422.222.

(v) Ensure that the plan's provider agreement contains a provision stating that after the expiration of the 60-day period specified in § 422.222:

(A) The provider will no longer be eligible for payment from the plan and will be prohibited from pursuing payment from the beneficiary as stipulated by the terms of the contract between CMS and the plan per § 422.504(g)(1)(iv); and

(B) The provider will hold financial liability for services, items, and drugs that are furnished, ordered, or prescribed after this 60-day period, at which point the provider and the beneficiary will have already received notification of the preclusion.

(2) The MA organization must provide for continuation of enrollee health care benefits-

(i) For all enrollees, for the duration of the contract period for which CMS payments have been made; and

(ii) For enrollees who are hospitalized on the date its contract with CMS terminates, or, in the event of an insolvency, through discharge.

(3) In meeting the requirements of this paragraph, other than the provider contract requirements specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the MA organization may use-

(i) Contractual arrangements;

(ii) Insurance acceptable to CMS;

(iii) Financial reserves acceptable to CMS; or

(iv) Any other arrangement acceptable to CMS.
