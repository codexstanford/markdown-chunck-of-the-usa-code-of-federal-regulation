####### Supplemental hearing.

(f)(1) The ALJ may conduct a supplemental hearing at any time before he or she mails a notice of the decision in order to receive new and material evidence, obtain additional testimony, or address a procedural matter. The ALJ determines whether a supplemental hearing is necessary and if one is held, the scope of the hearing, including when evidence is presented and what issues are discussed. Notice of the supplemental hearing must be sent in accordance with ยง 423.2022, except that the notice is sent to the enrollee and participants who attended the hearing, and any additional potential participants the ALJ determines are appropriate.

(2) If the enrollee requests the supplemental hearing and an adjudication period applies to the appeal in accordance with ยง 423.2016, the adjudication period is extended by the period between the initial hearing date and the supplemental hearing date.
