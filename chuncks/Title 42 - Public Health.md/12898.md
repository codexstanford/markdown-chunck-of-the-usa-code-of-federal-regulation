####### Adjustment of employer contribution.

(4)An employer contribution determined by an acceptable method may in some cases be adjusted if it would result in a nominal payment or no payment at all by HMO enrollees (because the HMO premium is lower than the premiums for the other alternatives offered). If, for example the employer has a policy of requiring all employees to contribute to their health benefits plan, the employer may require HMO enrollees who would otherwise pay little or nothing at all, to make a payment that does not exceed 50 percent of the employee contribution to the principal non-HMO alternative. The principal non-HMO alternative is the one that covers the largest number of enrollees from the particular employer.
