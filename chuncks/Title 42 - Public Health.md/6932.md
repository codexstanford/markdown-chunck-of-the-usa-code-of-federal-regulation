####### Basic rules.

(c)(1) A State that has a buy-in agreement in effect must enroll any individual who is eligible to enroll in SMI under § 407.10 and who is a member of the buy-in group, with the State paying the premiums on the individual's behalf. Individuals enrolled in the buy-in group can enroll in Part B at any time of the year, without regard to Medicare enrollment periods.

(2) Any State that does not have a buy-in agreement in effect may request buy-in for any one of the groups specified in §§ 407.42 and 407.43.

(3) Any State that does have an agreement may request a modification to cover a broader buy-in group or cancel its current agreement and request a new agreement to cover a narrower group.

(4) Any State that has a buy-in agreement in effect must participate in daily exchanges of enrollment data with CMS.

(5) In a 1634 State, CMS enrolls SSI beneficiaries in Medicare Part B, on behalf of the State, with the State paying the beneficiary's Part B premiums.

(6) Premiums paid under a State buy-in agreement are not subject to increase because of late enrollment or reenrollment.
