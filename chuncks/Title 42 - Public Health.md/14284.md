###### ยง 422.107 Requirements for dual eligible special needs plans.
####### Additional minimum contract requirement.

(d)(1) For any dual eligible special needs plan that is not a fully integrated or highly integrated dual eligible special needs plan, except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the contract must also stipulate that, for the purpose of coordinating Medicare and Medicaid-covered services between settings of care, the SNP notifies, or arranges for another entity or entities to notify, the State Medicaid agency, individuals or entities designated by the State Medicaid agency, or both, of hospital and skilled nursing facility admissions for at least one group of high-risk full-benefit dual eligible individuals, identified by the State Medicaid agency. The State Medicaid agency must establish the timeframe(s) and method(s) by which notice is provided. In the event that a SNP authorizes another entity or entities to perform this notification, the SNP must retain responsibility for complying with the requirement in this paragraph (d)(1).

(2) For a dual eligible special needs plan that, under the terms of its contract with the State Medicaid agency, only enrolls beneficiaries who are not entitled to full medical assistance under a State plan under title XIX of the Act, paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply if the SNP operates under the same parent organization and in the same service area as a dual eligible special needs plan limited to beneficiaries with full medical assistance under a State plan under title XIX of the Act that meets the requirements at paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
