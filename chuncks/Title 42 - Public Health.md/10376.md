####### Benefits to be paid.

(3)If an employee terminates participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan before their rights are vested, the applicable non-vested contributions/payments cannot be applied to increase the benefits of the surviving participants. Instead the non-vested contributions or payments should be used to reduce the provider of services contributions or payments to the Deferred Compensation Plan, in the cost reporting period in which the employee terminated participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Otherwise, the contributions/payments made by the provider of services must be applied to reduce the subsequent contributions or payments to the Deferred Compensation Plan in the next cost reporting period. If subsequent provider of services contributions/payments to the Deferred Compensation Plan are not made, then the provider of services costs are reduced by the contractor to the extent of such non-vested funds.
