(4)For fiscal year 2018 and subsequent fiscal years-

(i) In the case of a SNF that does not meet the requirements in ยง 413.360, for a fiscal year, the SNF market basket index percentage change for the fiscal year (as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, as modified by any applicable forecast error adjustment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, reduced by the MFP adjustment specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and as specified for FY 2018 in section 1888(e)(5)(B)(iii) of the Act), is further reduced by 2.0 percentage points.

(ii) The application of the 2.0 percentage point reduction specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to the SNF market basket index percentage change may result in such percentage being less than zero for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates for that fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

(iii) Any 2.0 percentage point reduction applied pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section will apply only to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the payment amount for a subsequent fiscal year.

(e) Pursuant to section 101 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) as revised by section 314 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), using the best available data, the Secretary will issue a new regulation with a newly refined case-mix classification system to better account for medically complex patients. Upon issuance of the new regulation, the temporary increases in payment for certain high cost patients will no longer be applicable.
