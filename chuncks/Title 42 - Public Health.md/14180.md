####### In-network MOOP limit.

(4)Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, MA local plans (as defined in ยง 422.2) must have an enrollee in-network maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) amount for basic benefits that is no greater than the annual limit calculated by CMS using Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) data projections. With respect to a private fee-for-service (PFFS) plan, the in-network MOOP limits specified in this paragraph (f)(4) apply.
