###### Criteria and Conditions for Redesignation
####### ยง 412.230 Criteria for an individual hospital seeking redesignation to another rural area or an urban area.
######## Limitations on redesignation.

(5)The following limitations apply to redesignation:

(i) An individual hospital may not be redesignated to another area for purposes of the wage index if the pre-reclassified average hourly wage for that area is lower than the pre-reclassified average hourly wage for the area in which the hospital is located. An urban hospital that has been granted redesignation as rural under ยง 412.103 is considered to be located in the rural area of the state for the purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(i).

(ii) A hospital may not be redesignated to more than one area, except for an urban hospital that has been granted redesignation as rural under ยง 412.103 and receives an additional reclassification by the MGCRB.

(iii) Beginning with wage index reclassification applications for FY 2003, if a hospital is already reclassified to a given geographic area for wage index purposes for a 3-year period, and submits an application for reclassification to the same area for either the second or third year of the 3-year period, that application will not be approved.
