####### Covered services not reimbursed to an HCPP.

(d)(1) Services reimbursed under Part A are not reimbursable to an HCPP. CMS makes payment for these services directly to the hospital, or other provider of services, on a reasonable cost basis through the provider's Medicare fiscal intermediary (for more details, see parts 412 and 413 of this chapter).

(2) Covered Part B services furnished by a provider of services to an HCPP's Medicare enrollees are not payable to the HCPP. CMS makes payment for these services to the provider on behalf of the Medicare enrollee through the provider's Medicare fiscal intermediary. This requirement does not affect Medicare payment to the HCPP for physicians' services furnished to its Medicare enrollees for which the physicians are compensated by the HCPP.
