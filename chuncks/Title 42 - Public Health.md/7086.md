###### ยง 408.102 Reconsideration of termination.
####### Basis for reinstating coverage.

(b)Coverage may be reinstated if the evidence establishes one of the following:

(1) The enrollee acted diligently to pay the premiums or to request relief upon receiving a premium notice very late in the grace period or shortly after its end, and the delayed notice was not the enrollee's fault. (For example, if the billing notice was misaddressed or lost in the mail, it would not be the enrollee's fault; if the enrollee had moved and not notified SSA of the new address, he or she would be responsible for the delay.)

(2) On the basis of information given by SSA, the enrollee could reasonably have believed that the premiums were being paid by deduction from benefits or by some other means. (An example would be a notice indicating that premiums would be paid by a State Medicaid agency or a group payer or would be deducted from the spouse's civil service annuity.)
