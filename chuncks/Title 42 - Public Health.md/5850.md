###### § 405.502 Criteria for determining reasonable charges.
####### Responsibility of Administration and carriers.

(d)Determinations by carriers of reasonable charge are not reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, although the general procedures and performance of functions by carriers are evaluated. In making determinations, carriers apply the provisions of the law under broad principles issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These principles are intended to assure overall consistency among carriers in their determinations of reasonable charge. The principles in §§ 405.503 through 405.507 establish the criteria for making such determinations in accordance with the statutory provisions.
