####### Reference cost reporting period.

(6)(i) To determine a hospital's reference resident level, CMS determines, for a hospital's three most recent cost reporting periods ending before March 23, 2010, for which a cost report has been either settled or submitted (subject to audit) to the Medicare contractor by March 23, 2010, the cost reporting period with the highest resident level.

(ii) If the cost report that is used to determine a hospital's otherwise applicable FTE resident cap in the reference period is not equal to 12 months, the Medicare contractor may make appropriate modifications to apply the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section based on the equivalent of a 12-month cost reporting period.
