####### General principle.

(a)If a Medicare beneficiary has a primary health insurer other than Medicare and that primary health insurer has primary liability for the transplant and organ acquisition costs, the Medicare Program may share a liability for organ acquisition costs as a secondary payer to the TH that performs the transplant in certain instances. To determine whether Medicare has liability to the TH that performs the transplant as a secondary payer for organ acquisition costs, it is necessary for the TH that performs the transplant to review the TH's agreement with the primary insurer.
