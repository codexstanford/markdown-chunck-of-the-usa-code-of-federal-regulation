The term also includes any school which provides not less than a one-year program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation and which meets the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (4), and (5) of this definition. The term also includes a public or nonprofit private educational institution in any state which, in lieu of the requirement in paragraph (1), admits as regular students persons who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state in which the institution is located and who meet the requirements of section 1091(d) of title 20 U.S. Code, as amended. For purposes of this definition, the Secretary of Education publishes a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations which that official determines to be reliable authority as to the quality of training offered. This list is found in the brochure, "Nationally Recognized Accrediting Agencies and Associations Criteria and Procedures for Listing by the U.S. Secretary of Education and Current List."
