####### State disproportionate share hospital allotment for Federal fiscal years 1994 and after.

(c)For Federal fiscal years 1994 and after-

(1) For low-DSH States, CMS will calculate the DSH allotment for each Federal fiscal year by increasing the prior year's State DSHs allotment by-

(i) State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and

(ii) A supplemental amount, if applicable, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments applicable to any Federal fiscal year may not exceed the dollar amount of payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State base allotment). This payment limitation will apply until the Federal fiscal year in which the State's DSH payments applicable to that Federal fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures in that Federal fiscal year, equal 12 percent or less. When a high-DSH State's percentage equals 12 percent or less, the State will be reclassified as a low-DSH State.
