####### Self-referral.

(a)When an MA plan member receives an item or service of the plan that is covered upon referral or pre-authorization from a contracted provider of that plan, the member cannot be financially liable for more than the normal in-plan cost sharing, if the member correctly identified himself or herself as a member of that plan to the contracted provider before receiving the covered item or service, unless the contracted provider can show that the enrollee was notified prior to receiving the item or service that the item or service is covered only if further action is taken by the enrollee.
