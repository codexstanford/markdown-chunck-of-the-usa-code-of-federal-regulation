####### Method of payment.

(2)Payments for the phased down State contribution begins in January 2006, and are made on a monthly basis for each subsequent month. State payment must be made in a manner specified by CMS that is similar to the manner in which State payments are made under the State Buy-in Program except that all payments must be deposited into the Medicare Prescription Drug Account in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The policy on collection of the Phased-down State contribution payment is the same as the policy that governs collection of Part A and Part B Medicare premiums for State Buy-in.
