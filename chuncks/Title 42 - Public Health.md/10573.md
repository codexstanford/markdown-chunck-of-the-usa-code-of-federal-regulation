####### Application,Computation of equity capital.

(c)-(1)For purposes of computing the allowable return, the provider's equity capital means-

(i) The provider's investment in plant, property, and equipment related to patient care (net of depreciation) and funds deposited by a provider who leases plant, property, or equipment related to patient care and is required by the terms of the lease to deposit such funds (net of noncurrent debt related to such investment or deposited funds); and

(ii) Net working capital maintained for necessary and proper operation of patient care activities. However, debt representing loans from partners, stockholders, or related organizations on which interest payments would be allowable as costs but for the provisions of ยง 413.153(b)(3)(ii), is not subtracted in computing the amount of equity capital in order that the proceeds from such loans be treated as part of the provider's equity capital. In computing the amount of equity capital upon which a return is allowable, investment in facilities is recognized on the basis of the historical cost, or other basis, used for depreciation and other purposes under Part A of Medicare.
