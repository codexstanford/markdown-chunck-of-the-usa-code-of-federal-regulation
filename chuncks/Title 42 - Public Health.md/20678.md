####### Disenrollment requested by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity.

(b)All MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM and PCCM entity contracts must:

(1) Specify the reasons for which the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity may request disenrollment of an enrollee.

(2) Provide that the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity may not request disenrollment because of an adverse change in the enrollee's health status, or because of the enrollee's utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or her special needs (except when his or her continued enrollment in the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity seriously impairs the entity's ability to furnish services to either this particular enrollee or other enrollees).
