####### Plan-bid component of the region-specific benchmark.

(4)For each regional plan offered in a region, CMS will multiply the plan's unadjusted region-specific non-drug bid amount by the plan's share of enrollment (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section) and then sum these products across all plans offered in the region. CMS then multiples this by 1 minus the statutory market share to determine the plan-bid component of the regional benchmark.
