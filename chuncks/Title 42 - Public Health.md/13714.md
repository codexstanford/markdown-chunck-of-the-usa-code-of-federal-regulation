(b). (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when a procedure is terminated prior to completion due to extenuating circumstances or circumstances that threaten the well-being of the patient, the Medicare program payment amount and the beneficiary copayment amount are based on-

(i) The full program and beneficiary copayment amounts if the procedure for which anesthesia is planned is discontinued after the induction of anesthesia or after the procedure is started;

(ii) One-half the full program and the beneficiary copayment amounts if the procedure for which anesthesia is planned is discontinued after the patient is prepared and taken to the room where the procedure is to be performed but before anesthesia is induced; or

(iii) One-half of the full program and beneficiary copayment amounts if a procedure for which anesthesia is not planned is discontinued after the patient is prepared and taken to the room where the procedure is to be performed.

(2) For all device-intensive procedures (defined as having a device offset of greater than 40 percent), the device offset portion of the device-intensive procedure payment is subtracted prior to determining the program payment and beneficiary copayment amounts identified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
