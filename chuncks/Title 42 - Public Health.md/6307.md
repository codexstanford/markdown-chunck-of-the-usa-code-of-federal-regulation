(1) In order for the QIO to determine whether the provider has met the burden of proof, the provider should supply any and all information that a QIO requires to sustain the provider's termination decision, consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) The beneficiary may submit evidence to be considered by a QIO in making its decision.
