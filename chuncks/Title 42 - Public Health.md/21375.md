####### Service plan

means the written document that specifies the services and supports (regardless of funding source) that are to be furnished to meet the needs of a participant in the self-directed PAS option and to assist the participant to direct the PAS and to remain in the community. The service plan is developed based on the assessment of need using a person-centered and directed process. The service plan builds upon the participant's capacity to engage in activities that promote community life and respects the participant's preferences, choices, and abilities. The participant's representative, if any, families, friends and professionals, as desired or required by the participant, will be involved in the service-planning process.
