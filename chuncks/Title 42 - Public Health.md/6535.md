###### § 405.1877 Judicial review.
####### Administrator accepts review and timely decision is not rendered.

(4)If the Administrator decides to review, in a notice under § 405.1875(c)(3) of this subpart, any issue in a Board decision specified as final, or deemed to be final by the Administrator, under § 405.1875(a)(2), but he or she does not render a decision within the 60-day review period, this subsequent inaction constitutes an affirmation of the Board's decision by the Administrator, for purposes of the time in which to seek judicial review. In this case, the provider must file any civil action requesting judicial review of the Administrator's final decision under section 1878(f)(1) of the Act no later than 60 days after the expiration of the 60-day period for a decision by the Administrator under § 405.1875(a)(1) and § 405.1875(e)(2) of this subpart.
