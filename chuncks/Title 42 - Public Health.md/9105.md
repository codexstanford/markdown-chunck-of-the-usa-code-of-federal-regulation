######## Measure score standardization.

(2)All measure scores are standardized by calculating Z-scores so that all measures are on a single, common scale to be consistent in terms of direction (that is, higher scores are better) and numerical magnitude. This is calculated by subtracting the national mean measure score from each hospital's measure score and dividing the difference by the measure standard deviation in order to standardize measures.
