######## Evidence related to issues previously considered by the QIC.

(c)(1) If new evidence related to issues previously considered by the QIC is submitted to the Council by a provider, supplier, or a beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier, the Council must determine if the provider, supplier, or the beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier had good cause for submitting it for the first time at the Council level.

(3) The Council must notify all parties if it excludes the evidence. The Council may remand to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator if-

(i) The ALJ or attorney adjudicator did not consider the new evidence submitted by the provider, supplier, or beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier because good cause did not exist; and

(ii) The Council finds that good cause existed under ยง 405.1028 and the ALJ or attorney adjudicator should have reviewed the evidence.

(iii) The new evidence is submitted by a party that is not a provider, supplier, or a beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier.
