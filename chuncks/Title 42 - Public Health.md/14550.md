() The projected number of cases not forwarded to the IRE is at least 10 in a 3-month period.

(L) A confidence interval estimate for the true error rate for the contract is calculated using a Score Interval (Wilson Score Interval) at a confidence level of 95 percent and an associated z of 1.959964 for a contract that is subject to a possible reduction.

(M) A contract's lower bound is compared to the thresholds of the scaled reductions to determine the IRE data completeness reduction.

(N) The reduction is identified by the highest threshold that a contract's lower bound exceeds.

(O) CMS reduces the measure rating to 1 star for the applicable appeals measure(s) if a contract fails to submit Timeliness Monitoring Project data for CMS's review to ensure the completeness of the contract's IRE data.

(2) CMS will reduce a measure rating to 1 star for additional concerns that data inaccuracy, incompleteness, or bias have an impact on measure scores and are not specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, including a contract's failure to adhere to HEDIS, HOS, or CAHPS reporting requirements.
