####### Annual State share determination.

(b)CMS determines whether the amount to be repaid exceeds 0.25 percent of the annual State share as follows:

(1) If the Medicaid program is ongoing, CMS uses the annual estimated State share of Medicaid expenditures for the current year, as shown on the State's latest Medicaid Program Budget Report (CMS-37). The current year is the year in which the State requests the repayment by installments.

(2) If the Medicaid program has been terminated by Federal law or by the State, CMS uses the actual State share that is shown on the State's CMS-64 Quarterly Expense Report for the last four quarters filed.
