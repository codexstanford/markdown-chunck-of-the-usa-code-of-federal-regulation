(c)The following illustrates how a provider would determine an amount to be allowed under this principle: The prevailing salary for a lay nurse working in Hospital A is $5,000 for the year. The lay nurse receives no maintenance or special perquisites. A sister working as a nurse engaged in the same activities in the same hospital receives maintenance and special perquisites which cost the hospital $2,000 and are included in the hospital's allowable operating costs. The hospital would then include in its records an additional $3,000 to bring the value of the services rendered to $5,000. The amount of $3,000 would be allowable if the provider assumes obligation for the expense under a written agreement with the sisterhood or other religious order covering payment by the provider for the services.
