###### Reconsideration
####### ยง 405.966 Evidence to be submitted with the reconsideration request.
######## Evidence submitted with the request.

(a)When filing a request for reconsideration, a party should present evidence and allegations of fact or law related to the issue in dispute and explain why it disagrees with the initial determination, including the redetermination.

(1) This evidence must include any missing documentation identified in the notice of redetermination, consistent with ยง 405.956(b)(6).

(2) Absent good cause, failure to submit all evidence, including documentation requested in the notice of redetermination prior to the issuance of the notice of reconsideration precludes subsequent consideration of that evidence.
