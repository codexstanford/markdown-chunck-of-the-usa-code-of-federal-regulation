####### Plan's share of enrollment.

(5)CMS will calculate the plan's share of MA enrollment in the region as follows:

(i) In the first year that any MA regional plan is being offered in an MA region, and more than one MA regional plan is being offered, CMS will determine each regional plan's share of enrollment based on one of two possible approaches. CMS may base this factor on equal division among plans, so that each plan's share will be 1 divided by the number of plans offered. Alternatively, CMS may base this factor on each regional plan's estimate of projected enrollment. Plan enrollment projections are subject to review and adjustment by CMS to assure reasonableness.

(ii) If two or more regional plans are offered in a region and were offered in the reference month: The plan's share of enrollment will be the number of MA eligible individuals enrolled in the plan divided by the number of MA eligible individuals enrolled in all of the plans in the region, as of the reference month.

(iii) If a single regional plan is being offered in the region: The plan's share of enrollment is equal to 1.
