####### Bankruptcy protection.

(c)In the event a loan beneficiary files for bankruptcy protection in a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise proves to be insolvent, CMS may terminate the deferment period described in paragraph (b) of this section and require immediate payment of the loan. If a loan beneficiary should file for bankruptcy protection in a court of competent jurisdiction or should otherwise evidence insolvency after the deferment period we will require immediate repayment of the outstanding principal and interest due. Those payments may be deducted from any Medicare payments otherwise due that hospital.
