(g)(1) The supplier that furnishes an item for the first month during which payment is made using the methodology described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section must continue to furnish the equipment until medical necessity ends, or the 13-month period of continuous use ends, whichever is earlier, unless-

(i) The item becomes subject to a competitive acquisition program implemented in accordance with section 1847(a) of the Act;

(ii) The beneficiary relocates to an area that is outside the normal service area of the supplier that initially furnished the equipment;

(iii) The beneficiary elects to obtain the equipment from a different supplier prior to the expiration of the 13-month rental period; or

(iv) CMS or the carrier determines that an exception should apply in an individual case based on the circumstances.

(2) A capped rental item furnished under this section may not be replaced by the supplier prior to the expiration of the 13-month rental period unless:

(i) The supplier replaces an item with the same, or equivalent, make and model of equipment because the item initially furnished was lost, stolen, irreparably damaged, is being repaired, or no longer functions;

(ii) A physician orders different equipment for the beneficiary. If the need for different equipment is based on medical necessity, then the order must indicate why the equipment initially furnished is no longer medically necessary and the supplier must retain this order in the beneficiary's medical record;

(iii) The beneficiary chooses to obtain a newer technology item or upgraded item and signs an advanced beneficiary notice (ABN); or

(iv) CMS or the carrier determines that a change in equipment is warranted.

(3) Before furnishing a capped rental item, the supplier must disclose to the beneficiary its intentions regarding whether it will accept assignment of all monthly rental claims for the duration of the rental period. A supplier's intentions could be expressed in the form of a written agreement between the supplier and the beneficiary.

(4) No later than two months before the date on which the supplier must transfer title to a capped rental item to the beneficiary, the supplier must disclose to the beneficiary whether it can maintain and service the item after the beneficiary acquires title to it. CMS or its carriers may make exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
