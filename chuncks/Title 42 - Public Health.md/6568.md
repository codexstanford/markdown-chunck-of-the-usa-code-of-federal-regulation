(a)(1) In response to a request from an entity that wishes to participate in the Medicare program, CMS enters into an agreement with an entity when all of the following occur:

(i) HRSA approves the entity as meeting the requirements of section 330 of the PHS Act.

(ii) The entity assures CMS that it meets the requirements specified in this subpart and part 491 of this chapter, as described in ยง 405.2434(a).

(iii) The FQHC terminates other provider agreements, unless the FQHC assures CMS that it is not using the same space, staff and resources simultaneously as a physician's office or another type of provider or supplier. A corporate entity may own other provider types as long as the provider types are distinct from the FQHC.

(2) CMS sends the entity a written notice of the disposition of the request.

(3) When the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section is satisfied, CMS sends the entity two copies of the agreement. The entity must sign and return both copies of the agreement to CMS.

(4) If CMS accepts the agreement filed by the FQHC, CMS returns to the center one copy of the agreement with the notice of acceptance specifying the effective date (see ยง 489.11), as determined under ยง 405.2434.
