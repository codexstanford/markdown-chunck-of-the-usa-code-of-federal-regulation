###### What are the rules governing the disposition of necropsy records?

(b)The CHIMP Act requires that necropsy records from chimpanzees previously used in federally funded research projects be made available on a reasonable basis to investigators engaged in biomedical or behavioral research. In order to comply with this provision, the contractor for the sanctuary system must devise a plan that will allow interested parties to contact the sanctuary and receive necropsy records when they become available. Records may be provided free of charge but requesters may be required to pay for packaging and shipping costs. The records may be created and retained in electronic form.
