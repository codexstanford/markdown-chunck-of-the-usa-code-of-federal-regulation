####### Annual payments.

(ii)If the plan sponsor elects a one-time final annual payment, it must submit, in a manner specified by CMS, within 15 months, or within any other longer time limit specified by CMS, after the end of the plan year, the total gross covered retiree plan-related prescription drug costs (as defined in ยง 423.882) for the plan year for which it is claiming a subsidy payment, actual rebate and other price concession data described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and any other data CMS may require. The alternative is that the sponsor can elect an interim annual payment, in which case it must submit the following to CMS, at a time and in a manner specified by CMS: the gross covered retiree plan-related prescription drug costs (as defined in ยง 423.882) incurred for all of its qualifying covered retirees during the payment period for which it is claiming a subsidy payment; an estimate (using historical data and generally accepted actuarial principles) of the difference between such gross costs and allowable costs (based on expected rebates and other price concessions for the upcoming plan year); and any other data CMS may require.
