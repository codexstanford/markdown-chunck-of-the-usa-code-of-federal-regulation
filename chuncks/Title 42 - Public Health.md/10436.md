###### ยง 413.114 Payment for posthospital SNF care furnished by a swing-bed hospital.
####### Special rules for determining the reasonable cost of posthospital SNF care furnished in cost reporting periods beginning prior to July 1, 2002.

(c)The reasonable cost of posthospital SNF care furnished by a swing-bed hospital is determined as follows:

(1) The reasonable cost of routine SNF services is based on the average Medicare rate per patient day for routine services provided in freestanding SNFs in the region where the swing-bed hospital is located. The rates are calculated using the regions as defined in section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act. The rates are based on the most recent year for which settled cost reporting period data are available, increased in a compounded manner, using the increase applicable to the SNF routine cost limits, up to and including the calendar year for which the rates are in effect. If the current Medicare swing-bed rate for routine extended care services furnished by a swing-bed hospital during a calendar year is less than the rate for the prior calendar year, payment is made based on the prior calendar year's rate.

(2) The reasonable cost of ancillary services furnished as posthospital SNF care is determined in the same manner as the reasonable cost of other ancillary services furnished by the hospital in accordance with ยง 413.53(a)(1).
