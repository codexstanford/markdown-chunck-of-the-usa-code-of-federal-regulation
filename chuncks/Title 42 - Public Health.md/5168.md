####### Re-application.

(f)A qualified entity that is in good standing may re-apply for qualified entity status. A qualified entity is considered to be in good standing if it has had no violations of the requirements in this subpart or if the qualified entity is addressing any past deficiencies either on its own or through the implementation of a corrective action plan. To re-apply a qualified entity must submit to CMS documentation of any changes to what was included in its previously-approved application. A re-applicant must submit this documentation at least 6 months before the end of its 3-year approval period and will be able to continue to serve as a qualified entity until the re-application is either approved or denied by CMS. If the re-application is denied, CMS will terminate its relationship with the qualified entity and the qualified entity will be subject to the requirements for return or destruction of data at ยง 401.721(b).
