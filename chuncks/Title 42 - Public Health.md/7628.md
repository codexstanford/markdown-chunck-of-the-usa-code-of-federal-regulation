###### ยง 410.67 Medicare coverage and payment of Opioid use disorder treatment services furnished by Opioid treatment programs.
####### Bundled payments for opioid use disorder treatment services furnished by opioid treatment programs.

(d)(1) CMS will establish categories of bundled payments for opioid treatment programs for an episode of care as follows:

(i) Categories for each type of opioid agonist and antagonist treatment medication;

(ii) A category for medication not otherwise specified, which will be used for new FDA-approved opioid agonist or antagonist treatment medications for which CMS has not established a category; and

(iii) A category for episodes of care in which no medication is provided.

(2) The bundled payment for episodes of care in which a medication is provided consists of payment for a drug component, reflecting payment for the applicable FDA-approved opioid agonist or antagonist medication in the patient's treatment plan, and a non-drug component, reflecting payment for all other opioid use disorder treatment services reflected in the patient's treatment plan (including dispensing/administration of the medication, if applicable). The payments for the drug component and non-drug component are added together to create the bundled payment amount. The bundled payment for episodes of care in which no medication is provided consists of a single payment amount for all opioid use disorder treatment services reflected in the patient's treatment plan (excluding medication and dispensing/administration of medication).
