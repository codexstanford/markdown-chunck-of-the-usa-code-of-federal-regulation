####### Acute renal failure (ARF).

(12)ARF is the sudden loss of the kidneys' ability to perform their main function of eliminating excess fluids and electrolytes (salts), as well as waste material from the blood. ARF, which is also called acute kidney injury, develops rapidly over a few hours or a few days. ARF can be fatal and requires intensive treatment; however, ARF may be reversible. ARF may cause permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease necessitating dialysis or transplant. A Table 2 injury for ARF has occurred if there is sufficient evidence in the medical record of an occurrence of ARF within the identified timeframe and the individual received the associated countermeasure (VIGIV).
