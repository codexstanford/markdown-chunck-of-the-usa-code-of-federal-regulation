####### ยง 405.1122 What evidence may be submitted to the Council.
######## Appeal before Council as a result of appellant's request for escalation.

(b)(1) If the Council is reviewing a case that is escalated from the OMHA level to the Council, the Council will decide the case based on the record constructed at the QIC and any additional evidence, including oral testimony, entered in the record by the ALJ or attorney adjudicator before the case was escalated.

(2) If the Council receives additional evidence with the request for escalation that is material to the question to be decided, or determines that additional evidence is needed to resolve the issues in the case, and the record provided to the Council indicates that the previous decision-makers did not attempt to obtain the evidence before escalation, the Council may remand the case to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator to consider or obtain the evidence and issue a new decision.
