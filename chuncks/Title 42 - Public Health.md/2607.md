(e)(1) Upon receipt of a written request showing good cause therefor by the individual having a payback obligation, the Secretary may:

(i) Extend the period for beginning the obligated service (24 months after termination of the clinical traineeship), permit breaks in the required continuous service or extend the period for repayment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if it is determined that:

(A) An extension or break in service is necessary for the completion of training;

(B) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because a temporary disability makes present performance impossible; or

(C) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because present performance would involve a substantial hardship and failure to extend the period would be against equity and good conscience.

(ii) Waive, in whole or in part, the service payback and recovery requirements of this section if it is determined that fulfillment would be impossible because the individual is permanently and totally disabled.

(iii) In making determinations under ยง 64a.105(e)(1)(i)(C), the Secretary will take into consideration the following factors:

(A) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;

(B) The individual's estimated future financial resources and obligations;

(C) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete the requirements within the prescribed period, such as problems of a personal nature;

(D) The unavailability of employment opportunities appropriate to the individual's education and training; and

(E) Any other extenuating circumstances.

(2) Upon receipt of written notice giving evidence of a conflicting obligation under section 752 or 753 of the Act or of an election to fulfill an obligation under section 472 of the Act prior to an obligation under this section, the Secretary will extend the period for beginning service (24 months after termination of the clinical traineeship), permit breaks in the required continuous service or extend the period for repayment under paragraph (g)(1), as appropriate.

(3) The service payback and recovery obligations of an individual will be cancelled upon the submission to the Secretary of a certificate of that individual's death or other evidence which the Secretary determines to be satisfactory.
