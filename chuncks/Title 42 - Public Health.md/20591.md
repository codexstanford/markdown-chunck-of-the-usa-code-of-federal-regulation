####### Nursing facilities.

(B)For nursing facility services, calculate the product of the actual supplemental payments paid and the ratio achieved by dividing the amount paid through state plan approved rates for nursing facility services that are being transitioned from payment in a FFS delivery system to the managed care contract by the total amount paid through payment rates for nursing facility services made in the State's FFS delivery system. Both the numerator and denominator of the ratio should exclude any supplemental payments made to the applicable providers.
