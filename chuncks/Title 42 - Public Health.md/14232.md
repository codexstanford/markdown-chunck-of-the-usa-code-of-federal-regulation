####### Rules for calculating copayment limits.

(ii)For 2023 and subsequent years, CMS calculates copayment limits for the basic benefits listed in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section subject to the requirements in paragraph (f)(7) of this section and the restrictions on increases to copayment limits in paragraph (f)(8) of this section. If CMS does not calculate a copayment limit for a benefit listed in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, an MA plan must establish a copayment that does not exceed an actuarially equivalent value to the coinsurance required under original Medicare; such actuarially equivalent value must be established in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section and based on the average Medicare FFS allowed amount in the plan's service area or the estimated total MA plan financial liability for that benefit for that contract year.
