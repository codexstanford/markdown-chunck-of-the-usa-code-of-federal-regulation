#### PART 413 - PRINCIPLES OF REASONABLE COST REIMBURSEMENT; PAYMENT FOR END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE SERVICES; PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED PAYMENT RATES FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES; PAYMENT FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY DIALYSIS
##### Subpart C - Limits on Cost Reimbursement
###### ยง 413.35 Limitations on coverage of costs: Charges to beneficiaries if cost limits are applied to services.
####### Provider charges,Establishing the charges.

(c)-(1)If the actual cost incurred (or, if less, the customary charges) in the prior period determined under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the limits applicable to the pertinent period, the provider may charge the beneficiary to the extent costs in the second preceding cost reporting period (or the equivalent when there is no second preceding period) exceed the current cost limits. (Data from the most recently submitted appropriate cost report will be used in determining the actual cost.) For example, if a limit of $58 per day is applied to the cost of general routine services for the provider's cost reporting period starting in calendar year 1975 and if the provider's actual general routine cost in the second preceding reporting period, that is, the reporting period starting in calendar year 1973, was $60 per day, the provider (after first having obtained contractor validation and subject to the considerations and requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section) may charge Medicare Part A beneficiaries up to $2 per day for general routine services.
