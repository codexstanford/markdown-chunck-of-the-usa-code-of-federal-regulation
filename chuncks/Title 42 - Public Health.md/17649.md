####### Timeliness.

(d)(1) The succeeding sections of this subpart also specify the timeframes for certification and for initial and subsequent recertifications.

(2) A hospital or SNF may provide for obtaining a certification or recertification earlier than required by these regulations or vary the timeframe (within the prescribed outer limits) for different diagnostic or clinical categories.

(3) Delayed certification and recertification statements are acceptable when there is a legitimate reason for delay. (For instance, the patient was unaware of his or her entitlement when he or she was treated.) Delayed certification and recertification statements must include an explanation of the reasons for the delay.

(4) A delayed certification may be included with one or more recertifications on a single signed statement.

(5) For all inpatient hospital services, including inpatient psychiatric facility services, a delayed certification may not extend past discharge.
