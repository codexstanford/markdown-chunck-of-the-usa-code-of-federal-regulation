###### ยง 413.139 Depreciation: Optional allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs.
####### Allowance based on a percentage of operating costs.

(d)(1) The allowance for depreciation based on a percentage of operating costs is to be computed by applying a specified percentage to a base amount equal to the provider's 1965 total operating costs, without adjustments to these principles or the current year's allowable operating costs, whichever is lower. The percentage to be applied is five for the reporting period that starts before or during 1966-67, four and one-half for the reporting period that begins during 1967-68, and continues to decline annually by equal amounts to become zero in 1976-77.

(2) If used as a base for determining the optional allowance for depreciation, neither the 1965 operating costs nor the current year's allowable costs are to include any actual depreciation, estimated depreciation on rented depreciable-type assets, allowance in lieu of specific recognition of other costs, or return on equity capital. Such exclusions are to be made only for the purpose of computing the allowance for depreciation based on operating costs. For other purposes, the excluded amounts are recognized in determining allowable costs and for computing the costs of services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the reporting period.
