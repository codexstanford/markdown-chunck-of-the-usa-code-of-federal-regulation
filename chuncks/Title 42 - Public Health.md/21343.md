####### Amendment of the APEL.

(d)The State may request amendment of its APEL to reflect an increase in the aggregate amount of medical assistance for NF services and for services included in the calculation of the APEL as required by paragraph (c) of this section when the increase is directly attributable to legislation enacted on or after December 22, 1987, which amends title XIX of the Act. Costs attributable to laws enacted before December 22, 1987 will not be considered. Because the APEL for each year of the waiver is computed separately from the APEL for any other waiver year, a separate amendment must be submitted for each year in which the State chooses to raise its APEL. Documentation specific to the waiver year involved must be submitted to CMS.
