####### Emergency delivery

means delivery of a CAP drug within one business day in appropriate shipping and packaging, in all areas of the United States and its territories, with the exception of the Pacific Territories. In the Pacific Territories, emergency delivery means delivery of a CAP drug within 5 business days in appropriate shipping and packaging. In each case, this timeframe shall be reduced if product stability requires it, meaning that the manufacturer's labeling instructions, drug compendia, or specialized drug stability references indicate that a shorter delivery timeframe is necessary to avoid adversely affecting the product's integrity, safety, or efficacy.
