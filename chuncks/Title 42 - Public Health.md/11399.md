are physician services that are differentiated from routine professional services and other physician services because they are supervision, as described in the definition of "supervision of staff" of this section, or are not related directly to the care of an individual patient, but are supportive of the facility as a whole and of benefit to patients in general. Examples of administrative services include supervision of staff, staff training, participation in staff conferences and in the management of the facility, and advising staff on the procurement of supplies.
