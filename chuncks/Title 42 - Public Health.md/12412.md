####### APM Incentive Payment recipient.

(c)CMS will pay the APM Incentive Payment amount for a payment year to a solvent TIN or TINs associated with the QP, identified based on Medicare Part B claims submitted for covered professional services during the base period or payment year, according to this section. If no TIN or TINs with which the QP has an association can be identified at a step, CMS will move to the next and successive steps listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section until CMS identifies a TIN or TINs with which the QP is associated, and to which CMS will make the APM Incentive Payment. If more than one TIN is identified at a step, the payment will be proportionately divided among the TINs according to the relative total paid amounts for Part B covered professional services paid to each TIN for services provided during the base year.

(1) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the QP Performance Period, is associated with an APM Entity through which the eligible clinician achieved QP status;

(2) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the APM Incentive Payment base period, is associated with an APM Entity through which the eligible clinician achieved QP status;

(3) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the APM Incentive Payment base period, is associated with an APM Entity participating in an Advanced APM through which the eligible clinician had achieved QP status;

(4) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the APM Incentive Payment base period, participated in an APM Entity in an Advanced APM;

(5) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the APM Incentive Payment base period, participated with an APM Entity in any track of the APM through which the eligible clinician achieved QP status;

(6) Any TIN associated with the QP that, during the APM Incentive Payment base period, participated with an APM Entity in an APM other than an Advanced APM;

(7) Any TIN associated with the QP that submitted a claim for covered professional services furnished by the QP during the APM Incentive Payment base period, even if such TIN has no relationship to any APM Entity or APM; then

(8) If we have not identified any TIN associated with the QP to which we can make the APM Incentive Payment, we will attempt to contact the QP via a public notice to request their Medicare payment information. The QPs identified in the public notice, or any other eligible clinicians who believe that they are entitled to an APM Incentive Payment must then notify CMS of their claim as directed in the public notice by September 1 of the payment year, or 60 days after CMS announces that initial payments for the year have been made, whichever is later. After that time, any claims by a QP to an APM Incentive Payment will be forfeited for such payment year.
