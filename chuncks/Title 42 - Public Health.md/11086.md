####### Qualified registry

means a medical registry or a maintenance of certification program operated by a specialty body of the American Board of Medical Specialties that, with respect to a particular program year, has self-nominated and successfully completed a vetting process (as specified by CMS) to demonstrate its compliance with the PQRS qualification requirements specified by CMS for that program year. The registry may act as a data submission vendor, which has the requisite legal authority to provide PQRS data (as specified by CMS) on behalf of an eligible professional to CMS. If CMS finds that a qualified registry submits grossly inaccurate data for reporting periods occurring in a particular year, CMS reserves the right to disqualify a registry for reporting periods occurring in the subsequent year.
