Prior to the automatic advancement for performance year 2022, an ACO that is participating in the BASIC track's glide path for performance year 2021 may elect to remain in the same level of the BASIC track's glide path in which it participated during the 2021 performance year, for performance year 2022. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)()() of this section, for performance year 2023, the ACO is automatically advanced to the level of the BASIC track's glide path to which the ACO would have automatically advanced absent the election to maintain its participation level for performance year 2022 and, if applicable, the election to maintain its participation level for performance year 2021 under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)()() of this section, unless the ACO elects to transition to a higher level of risk and potential reward within the BASIC track's glide path as provided in ยง 425.226(a)(2)(i). A voluntary election by an ACO under this paragraph must be made in the form and manner and by a deadline established by CMS.
