######## Methodology,Selection of measures.,Hospital Compare

(d)-(1)Measures are selected from those publicly reported onor its successor website through certain CMS quality programs under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(i) From this group of measures, measures falling into one or more of the exclusions in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section will be removed from consideration:

(A) Measures that 100 hospitals or less publicly report. These measures would not produce reliable measure group scores based on too few hospitals;

(B) Measures that cannot be standardized to a single, common scale and otherwise not amenable to inclusion in a summary score calculation alongside process and outcome measures or measures that cannot be combined in a meaningful way. This includes measures that cannot be as easily combined with other measures captured on a continuous scale with more granular data;

(C) Non-directional measures for which it is unclear whether a higher or lower score is better. These measures cannot be standardized to be combined with other measures and form an aggregate measure group score;
