####### Notice to States and showing of good faith.

(b)(1) If CMS is satisfied that the State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort, CMS will reduce the funds being disallowed in whole.

(2) CMS may find that a State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort if the State has taken the action it believed was needed to meet the threshold, but the threshold was not met. CMS will grant a good faith waiver only if the State both:

(i) Participates in the MEQC pilot program in accordance with §§ 431.800 through 431.820, and

(ii) Implements PERM CAPs in accordance with § 431.992.

(3) Each State that has an eligibility improper payment rate above the allowable threshold will be notified by CMS of the amount of the disallowance.
