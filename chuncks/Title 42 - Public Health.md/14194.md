CMS transitions to using the Medicare FFS data projections by factoring in a percentage of the ESRD cost differential on the following schedule:

(A) For 2023, CMS uses projected Medicare FFS beneficiary out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries without diagnoses of ESRD plus 70 percent of the ESRD cost differential.

(B) For 2024 and subsequent years, CMS uses the Medicare FFS data projections.
