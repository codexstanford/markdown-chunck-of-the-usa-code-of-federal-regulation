(i) The participant or other requestor listed in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section requests the extension.

(ii) The extension is in the participant's interest because the interdisciplinary team needs additional information from an individual not directly employed by the PACE organization that may change the interdisciplinary team's decision to deny a service.
