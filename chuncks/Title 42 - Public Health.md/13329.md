####### Application: Payment on a fee-for-service basis.

(3)If the HCPP pays for physicians' services and other Part B supplier services on a fee-for-service basis-

(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the costs incurred by the HCPP are considered reasonable if they do not exceed-

(A) The reasonable charges for those services, as defined in subpart E of part 405 of this chapter; and

(B) The amount that CMS would pay for those services if they were furnished to beneficiaries who are not enrolled in the HCPP and who receive the services from sources other than providers of services or other entities that are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis.

(ii) Payment to a physician group organized on an individual-practice basis is not subject to the paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section if the group pays its physicians on a fee-for-service basis and has procedures under which the members of the group accept effective incentives, such as risk-sharing, designed to avoid unnecessary or unduly costly utilization of health services. In these cases, the amount paid by an HCPP is considered reasonable if it meets the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
