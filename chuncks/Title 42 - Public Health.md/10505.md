####### Funding of depreciation.

(e)Although funding of depreciation is not required, it is strongly recommended that providers use this mechanism as a means of conserving funds for replacement of depreciable assets. Funded depreciation account funds must be placed in readily marketable investments of the type that assures the availability and conservation of the funds. Additions to the funded depreciation account must remain in the account for at least 6 months to be considered valid funding transactions.
