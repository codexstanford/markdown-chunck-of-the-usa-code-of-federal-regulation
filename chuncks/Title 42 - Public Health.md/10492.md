(d)-(1)Proration of the cost of an asset over its useful life is allowed on the straight-line method, or, when permitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the declining balance or the sum-of-the-years' digits methods. One method may be used on a single asset or group of assets and another method on others. In applying the declining balance or sum-of-the-years' digits method to an asset that is not new, the undepreciated cost of the asset is treated as the cost of a new asset in computing depreciation.
