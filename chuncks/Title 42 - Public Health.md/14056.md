###### ยง 422.4 Types of MA plans.
####### Multiple plans.

(b)Under its contract, an MA organization may offer multiple plans, regardless of type, provided that the MA organization is licensed or approved under State law to provide those types of plans (or, in the case of a PSO plan, has received from CMS a waiver of the State licensing requirement). If an MA organization has received a waiver for the licensing requirement to offer a PSO plan, that waiver does not apply to the licensing requirement for any other type of MA plan.
