######## Improvement score calculation.

(1)CMS uses the following scoring methodology to assess an ETC Participant's improvement score.

(i) Greater than 10 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 1.5 points

(ii) Greater than 5 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 1 point

(iii) Greater than 0 percent improvement relative to the Benchmark Year rate: 0.5 points

(iv) Less than or equal to the Benchmark Year rate: 0 points

(v) For MY3 through MY10, when calculating improvement benchmarks constructed based on the ETC Participant's aggregation group's historical performance on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate during the Benchmark Year, CMS adds one beneficiary month to the numerator of the home dialysis rate and adds one beneficiary month to the numerator of the transplant rate, such that the Benchmark Year rates cannot be equal to zero.
