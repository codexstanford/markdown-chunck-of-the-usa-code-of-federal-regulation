####### Pass-through payments for States transitioning services and populations from a fee-for-service delivery system to a managed care delivery system.

(6)Notwithstanding the restrictions on pass-through payments in paragraphs (d)(1), (3), and (5) of this section, a State may require the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to make pass-through payments to network providers that are hospitals, nursing facilities, or physicians under the contract, for each rating period of the transition period for up to 3 years, when Medicaid populations or services are initially transitioning from a fee-for-service (FFS) delivery system to a managed care delivery system, provided the following requirements are met:

(i) The services will be covered for the first time under a managed care contract and were previously provided in a FFS delivery system prior to the first rating period of the transition period.

(ii) The State made supplemental payments, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, to hospitals, nursing facilities, or physicians during the 12-month period immediately 2 years prior to the first year of the transition period.

(iii) The aggregate amount of the pass-through payments that the State requires the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to make is less than or equal to the amounts calculated in paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section for the relevant provider type for each rating period of the transition period. In determining the amount of each component for the calculations contained in paragraphs (d)(6)(iii)(A) through (C), the State must use the amounts paid for services during the 12-month period immediately 2 years prior to the first rating period of the transition period.
