####### Exceptions.

(2)(i) The Life Safety Code provisions do not apply in a State in which CMS determines that a fire and safety code imposed by State law adequately protects participants and staff.

(ii) In consideration of a recommendation by the State survey agency or Accrediting Organization or at the discretion of the Secretary, may waive, for periods deemed appropriate, specific provisions of the Life Safety Code, which would result in unreasonable hardship upon a PACE facility, but only if the waiver will not adversely affect the health and safety of the patients.

(3) A PACE center may install alcohol-based hand rub dispensers in its facility if the dispensers are installed in a manner that adequately protects against inappropriate access.

(4) When a sprinkler system is shut down for more than 10 hours in a 24-hour period, the PACE must:

(i) Evacuate the building or portion of the building affected by the system outage until the system is back in service, or

(ii) Establish a fire watch until the system is back in service.

(c) [Reserved]
