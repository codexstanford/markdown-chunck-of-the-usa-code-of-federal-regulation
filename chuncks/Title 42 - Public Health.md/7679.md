(e)Nurse practitioners can be paid for professional services only when the services have been personally performed by them and no facility or other provider charges, or is paid, any amount for the furnishing of the professional services.

(1) Supervision of other nonphysician staff by a nurse practitioner does not constitute personal performance of a professional service by a nurse practitioner.

(2) The services of a nurse practitioner are provided on an assignment-related basis, and the nurse practitioner may not charge a beneficiary in excess of the amounts permitted under 42 CFR 424.55. If a beneficiary has made payment for a service in excess of these limits, the nurse practitioner must refund the full amount of the impermissible charge to the beneficiary.
