(f)communications with Board staff concerning procedural matters are not prohibited.

(g) Upon receipt of a credible allegation that a party's representative has divulged to that party, or to the Board, information that was obtained during the course of the representative's relationship (such as legal counsel or employee) with an opposing party and that was intended by that party to be kept confidential, the Board-

(1) Investigates the allegation; and
