() The wage-adjusted 75th percentile target amounts for hospitals in the same class are determined by adding the nonlabor-related portion of the wage-neutralized 75th percentile target amounts under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)()() of this section and the hospital's wage-adjusted labor-related portion of the wage-neutralized 75th percentile target amounts determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)()() of this section, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.

(iv) For purposes of the limits on target amounts established under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, each hospital or unit that qualifies for exclusion as a member of only one class of excluded facility (psychiatric hospital or unit, rehabilitation hospital or unit, or long-term care hospital) will be subject to the limit applicable to that class. If a hospital or unit qualifies to be classified in more than one way under the exclusion criteria in subpart B of part 412 of this chapter, the hospital's or unit's target amount may not exceed the lowest applicable limit.

(v) In the case of a hospital that received payments under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section as a newly created hospital or unit, to determine the hospital's target amount for the hospital's third 12-month cost reporting period, the payment amount determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for the preceding cost reporting period is updated to the third cost reporting period.
