(3)To the extent a subpoena compels disclosure of a matter which an objection based on privilege, or other protection from disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality, or undue burden, was made before an ALJ, the Council may review immediately the ruling of the ALJ on the objections to the subpoena or that portion of the subpoena as applicable.

(i) Upon notice to the ALJ that the enrollee or a non-party, as applicable, intends to seek Council review of the ALJ's ruling on the subpoena, the ALJ must stay all proceedings affected by the subpoena.

(ii) The proceedings are stayed for 15 calendar days or until the Council issues a written decision that affirms, reverses, or modifies the ALJ's subpoena, whichever comes first.

(iii) If the Council does not take action within the 15 calendar days, then the stay is lifted and the enrollee or non-party must comply with the ALJ's subpoena.
