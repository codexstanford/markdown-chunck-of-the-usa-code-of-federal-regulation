####### Via a certified survey vendor in addition to a qualified registry.

(v)For a group practice of 2 or more eligible professionals that elects to report via a certified survey vendor in addition to a qualified registry for the 12-month 2018 PQRS payment adjustment reporting period, the group practice must have all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures reported on its behalf via a CMS-certified survey vendor. In addition, the group practice must report at least 3 additional measures using the qualified registry and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the group practice's Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. If less than 3 measures apply to the group practice, the group practice must report on each measure that is applicable, and report each measure for at least 50 percent of the Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service patients seen during the reporting period to which the measure applies. Measures with a 0 percent performance rate would not be counted (unless they are inverse measures where a lower rate reflects better performance).
