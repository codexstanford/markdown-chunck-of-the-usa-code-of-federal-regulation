####### Repeat deficiency

means a condition-level deficiency that is cited on the current survey and is substantially the same as or similar to, a finding of a standard-level or condition-level deficiency cited on the most recent previous standard survey or on any intervening survey since the most recent standard survey. Repeated non-compliance is not on the basis that the exact regulation (that is, tag number) for the deficiency was repeated.
