(ii)(A) Hospitals may have too few cases to report particular measures and, in those cases, may not report enough measures in one or more measure groups.

(B) When a hospital does not have enough measures in one or more measure groups due to too few cases CMS may re-distribute one or more of the missing measure group's weight proportionally across the remaining measure groups by subtracting the standard weight percentage of the group or groups with insufficient measures from 100 percent; and then dividing the resulting percentage across the remaining measure groups, giving new re-proportioned weights.
