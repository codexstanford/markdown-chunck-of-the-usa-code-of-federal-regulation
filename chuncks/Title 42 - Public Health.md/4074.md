###### ยง 110.20 How to establish a covered injury.
####### Injuries for which causation must be shown (non-Table injuries).,e.g.,

(c)If an injury is not included on a Table or if the injury does not meet the requirements set out for an injury that is listed on a Table (the first sign or symptom of the injury did not occur within the time interval specified on the Table), the requester must demonstrate that the injury occurred as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. Such proof must be based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence. Temporal association between receipt of the countermeasure and onset of the injury is not sufficient by itself to prove that the countermeasure caused the injury.
