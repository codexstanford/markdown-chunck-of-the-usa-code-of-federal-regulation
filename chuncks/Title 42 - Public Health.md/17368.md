An enrollee may request and receive a copy of all or part of the record of the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's action, including any index of the administrative record, documentary evidence, and a copy of the audio recording of the oral proceedings. However, the enrollee may be asked to pay the costs of providing these items.
