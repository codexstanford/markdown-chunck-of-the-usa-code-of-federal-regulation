###### ยง 422.458 Risk sharing with regional MA organizations for 2006 and 2007.
####### Organizational and financial requirements,General rule.

(e)-(1)Regional MA plans offered by MA organizations must be licensed under State law, or otherwise authorized under State law, as a risk-bearing entity (as defined in ยง 422.2) eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers one or more plans. However, as provided for under this section, MA organizations offering MA regional plans may obtain a temporary waiver of State licensure. In the case of an MA organization that is offering an MA regional plan in an MA region, and is not licensed in each State in which it offers such an MA regional plan, the following rules apply:

(i) The MA organization must be licensed to bear risk in at least one State of the region.

(ii) For the other States in a region in which the organization is not licensed to bear risk, if it demonstrates to CMS that it has filed the necessary application to meet those requirements, CMS may temporarily waive the licensing requirement with respect to each State for a period of time as CMS determines appropriate for the timely processing of the application by the State or States.

(iii) If the State licensing application or applications are denied, CMS may extend the licensing waiver through the end of the plan year or as CMS determines appropriate to provide for a transition.
