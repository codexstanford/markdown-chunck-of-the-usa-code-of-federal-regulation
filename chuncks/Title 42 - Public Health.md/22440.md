##### Subpart C - State Plan Requirements: Eligibility, Screening, Applications, and Enrollment
###### § 457.340 Application for and enrollment in CHIP.
####### Timely determination of eligibility.

(d)(1) The terms in § 435.912 of this chapter apply equally to CHIP, except that standards for transferring electronic accounts to other insurance affordability programs are pursuant to § 457.350 and the standards for receiving applications from other insurance affordability programs are pursuant to § 457.348 of this part.

(2) In applying timeliness standards, the State must define "date of application" and must count each calendar day from the date of application to the day the agency provides notice of its eligibility decision.

(3) In the case of individuals subject to a period of uninsurance under this part, the state must identify and implement processes to facilitate enrollment of CHIP-eligible children who have satisfied a period of uninsurance (as described under § 457.805). To minimize burden on individuals, a state may not require a new application or information already provided by a family immediately preceding the beginning of a waiting period. States must also ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to prevent a disruption in coverage for children transitioning from coverage under another insurance affordability program after the completion of a period of uninsurance.
