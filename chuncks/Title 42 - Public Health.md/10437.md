####### Additional requirements,General rule.

(d)-(1)For services furnished in cost reporting periods beginning prior to July 1, 2002, in order for Medicare payment to be made to a swing-bed hospital with more than 49 beds (but fewer than 100), the following payment requirements must be met:

(i) If there is an available SNF bed in the geographic region, a posthospital SNF care patient must be transferred within 5 days (excluding weekends and holidays) of the availability date, unless the patient's physician certifies within the 5-day period that transfer is not medically appropriate.

(ii) The number of patient days for posthospital SNF care in a cost reporting period does not exceed 15 percent of the product of the number of days in the period and the average number of licensed beds in the hospital in the period. In those States that do not license their hospital beds, the hospitals must use the total number of hospital beds reported on their most recent Certificate of Need (CON), excluding bassinets. If during the cost reporting period, there is an increase or decrease in the number of "licensed" beds, the number of "licensed" beds for each part of the period is to be multiplied by the number of days for which that number of "licensed" beds was available. After totalling the results, compute 15 percent of the total available "licensed" bed days to determine the payment limitation.
