###### Appeal process.

(c)Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the Administrator will appoint a Federal Official independent of the WTC Health Program to review the case. The Federal Official will review all available records relevant to the WTC Health Program's decision not to enroll the applicant or to disenroll the WTC Health Program member and assess whether the appeal should be granted. In conducting the review, the Federal Official's consideration will include the following: Whether the WTC Health Program substantially complied with all relevant WTC Health Program policies and procedures; whether the information supporting the WTC Health Program's decision was factually accurate; and whether the WTC Health Program's decision was reasonable as applied to the facts of the case.

(1) The Federal Official may consider additional relevant new information submitted by the denied applicant, disenrolled WTC Health Program member, or designated representative.

(2) The Federal Official will provide his or her recommendation regarding the disposition of the appeal, including his or her findings and any supporting materials, to the Administrator.
