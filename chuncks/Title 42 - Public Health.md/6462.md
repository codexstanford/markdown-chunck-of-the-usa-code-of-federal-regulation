###### ยง 405.1845 Composition of Board; hearings, decisions, and remands.
####### Oral hearings.

(f)(1) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the Board does not need a quorum in order to hold an oral hearing (as described in ยง 405.1851 of this subpart). The Chairperson of the Board may designate one or more Board members to conduct an oral hearing (where less than a quorum conducts the hearing). Because the presence of all Board members is not required at an oral hearing, the Board, at its discretion, may hold more than one oral hearing at a time.
