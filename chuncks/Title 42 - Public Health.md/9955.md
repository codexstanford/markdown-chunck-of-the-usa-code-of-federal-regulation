###### ยง 413.40 Ceiling on the rate of increase in hospital inpatient costs.
####### Significant wage increase.,Criteria.

(4)(i)CMS may make an adjustment to take into account a significant increase in wages occurring between the base period and the cost reporting period subject to the ceiling if there is a significant increase in the average hourly wage for the geographic area in which the hospital is located (determined by reference to the wage index for prospective payment hospitals without regard to geographic reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8) and (10) of the Act). For this purpose, there is a significant wage increase if the wage index value based on wage survey data collected for the cost reporting period subject to the ceiling is at least 8.0 percent higher than the wage index value based on survey data collected for the base year cost reporting period. If survey data are not available for the cost reporting periods used in the comparison, the wage index value based on the latest available survey data collected prior to that cost reporting period is used.
