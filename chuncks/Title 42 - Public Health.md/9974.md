####### Average cost per diem for general routine services

means the following:

(1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1982, subject to the provisions on swing-bed hospitals, the average cost of general routine services net of the private room cost differential. The average cost per diem is computed by the following methodology:

(i) Determine the total private room cost differential by multiplying the average per diem private room cost differential determined in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of private room patient days.

(ii) Determine the total inpatient general routine service costs net of the total private room cost differential by subtracting the total private room cost differential from total inpatient general routine service costs.

(iii) Determine the average cost per diem by dividing the total inpatient general routine service cost net of private room cost differential by all inpatient general routine days, including total private room days.

(2) For swing-bed hospitals, the amount computed by-

(i) Subtracting the routine costs associated with Medicare SNF-type days and non-Medicare NF-type days from the total allowable inpatient cost for routine services (excluding the cost of services provided in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other intensive care type inpatient hospital units and nursery costs); and

(ii) Dividing the remainder (excluding the total private room cost differential) by the total number of inpatient hospital days of care (excluding Medicare SNF-type days and non-Medicare NF-type days of care, days of care in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other intensive care type inpatient hospital units; and newborn days; but including total private room days).
