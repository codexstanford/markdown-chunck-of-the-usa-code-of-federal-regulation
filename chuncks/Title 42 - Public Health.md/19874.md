####### General requirements.

(c)(1) In order to claim the temporary FMAP increase for:

(i) The quarter in which November 2, 2020, falls, a state must meet the requirements described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from November 2, 2020, through the end of the quarter.

(ii) Any quarter beginning after November 2, 2020, through the quarter in which the public health emergency for COVID-19, including any extensions, ends, a state must meet the requirements described in paragraphs (c)(2) of this section.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, for all beneficiaries validly enrolled for benefits under the state plan, a waiver of such plan, or a demonstration project under section 1115(a) of the Act as of or after March 18, 2020, the state must maintain the beneficiary's enrollment as follows, through the end of the month in which the public health emergency for COVID-19 ends:

(i)(A) For beneficiaries whose Medicaid coverage meets the definition of MEC in paragraph (b) of this section as of or after March 18, 2020, the state must continue to provide Medicaid coverage that meets the definition of MEC, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

(B) For beneficiaries described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) whom the state subsequently determines are eligible for coverage under a Medicare Savings Program eligibility group, the state satisfies the requirement described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it furnishes the medical assistance available through the Medicare Savings Program.

(ii) For beneficiaries whose Medicaid coverage as of or after March 18, 2020 does not meet the definition of MEC in paragraph (b) of this section but does include coverage for testing services and treatments for COVID-19, including vaccines, specialized equipment, and therapies, the state must continue to provide Medicaid coverage that includes such testing services and treatments.

(iii) For beneficiaries not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the state must continue to provide at least the same level of medical assistance as was provided as of or after March 18, 2020.

(iv) If a state determines that a validly enrolled beneficiary is no longer eligible for Medicaid, including on a procedural basis, the state meets the requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section by continuing to provide the same Medicaid coverage that the beneficiary would have received absent the determination of ineligibility.

(3) Otherwise permissible changes to beneficiary coverage, cost sharing, and post-eligibility treatment of income, including both changes affecting an individual beneficiary and approved changes to the state plan, a section 1115 demonstration and/or a waiver authorized under section 1915 of the Act impacting multiple beneficiaries, will not impact a state's ability to claim the temporary FMAP increase provided that any such changes do not violate the requirement to maintain beneficiary enrollment described at paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the requirement in section 6008(b)(4) of the FFCRA.
