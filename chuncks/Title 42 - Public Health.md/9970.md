###### ยง 413.53 Determination of cost of services to beneficiaries.
####### Cost per visit by type-of-service method-HHAs.

(3)For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1980, all HHAs must use the cost per visit by type-of-service method of apportioning costs between Medicare and non-Medicare beneficiaries. Under this method, the total allowable cost of all visits for each type of service is divided by the total number of visits for that type of service. Next, for each type of service, the number of Medicare covered visits is multiplied by the average cost per visit just computed. This represents the cost Medicare will recognize as the cost for that service, subject to cost limits published by CMS (see ยง 413.30).
