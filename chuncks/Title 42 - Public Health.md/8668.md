####### Hospital's request for adjustment of base-year inpatient operating costs.

(c)(1) Before the date it becomes subject to the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, a hospital may request the intermediary to further adjust its estimated base-period costs to take into account the following:

(i) Services paid for under Medicare Part B during the hospital's base year that will be paid for under prospective payments. The base-year costs may be increased to include estimated payments for certain services previously billed as physicians' services before the effective date of ยง 415.102(a) of this chapter, and estimated payments for nonphysicians' services that were not furnished either directly or under arrangements before October 1, 1983 (the effective date of ยง 405.310(m) of this chapter), but may not include the costs of anesthetists' services for which a physician employer continues to bill under ยง 405.553(b)(4) of this chapter.

(ii) The payment of FICA taxes during cost reporting periods subject to the prospective payment system, if the hospital had not paid such taxes for all its employees during its base period and will be required to participate effective January 1, 1984.

(2) If a hospital requests that its base-period costs be adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must timely provide the intermediary with sufficient documentation to justify the adjustment, and adequate data to compute the adjusted costs. The intermediary decides whether to use part or all of the data on the basis of audit, survey and other information available.
