####### Enrollee's right to a fast-track appeal of an MA organization's termination decision.

(a)An enrollee of an MA organization has a right to a fast-track appeal of an MA organization's decision to terminate provider services.

(1) An enrollee who desires a fast-track appeal must submit a request for an appeal to an IRE under contract with CMS, in writing or by telephone, by noon of the first day after the day of delivery of the termination notice. If, due to an emergency, the IRE is closed and unable to accept the enrollee's request for a fast-track appeal, the enrollee must file a request by noon of the next day that the IRE is open for business.

(2) When an enrollee fails to make a timely request to an IRE, he or she may request an expedited reconsideration by the MA organization as described in ยง 422.584.

(3) If, after delivery of the termination notice, an enrollee chooses to leave a provider or discontinue receipt of covered services on or before the proposed termination date, the enrollee may not later assert fast-track IRE appeal rights under this section relative to the services or expect the services to resume, even if the enrollee requests an appeal before the discontinuation date in the termination notice.
