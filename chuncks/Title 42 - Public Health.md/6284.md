####### Delegation of appointment by appointed representative.

(l)(1) An appointed representative may not designate another individual to act as the appointed representative of the party unless-

(i) The appointed representative provides written notice to the party of the appointed representative's intent to delegate to another individual, which contains the name of the designee and the designee's acceptance to be obligated by and comply with the requirements of representation under this subpart; and

(ii) The party accepts the designation as evidenced by a written statement signed by the party. The written statement signed by the party is not required when the appointed representative and designee are attorneys in the same law firm or organization and the notice described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section so indicates.

(2) A delegation is not effective until the adjudicator receives a copy of the acceptance described in paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section, unless the appointed representative and designee are attorneys in the same law firm or organization, in which case the notice described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section may be submitted even though the acceptance described in paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section is not required.

(3) A party's or representative's failure to notify the adjudicator that an appointment of representative has been delegated is not good cause for missing a deadline or not appearing at a hearing.
