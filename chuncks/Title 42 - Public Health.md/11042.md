(2)(i) If, during the audit specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, CMS identifies any accreditation programs for which validation audit results indicate-

(A) A 10 percent or greater rate of disparity between findings by the accreditation organization and findings by CMS on standards that do not constitute immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety if unmet; or

(B) Any disparity between findings by the accreditation organization and findings by CMS on standards that constitute immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety if unmet; or,

(C) Irrespective of the rate of disparity, widespread or systemic problems in an organization's accreditation process such that accreditation by that accreditation organization no longer provides CMS with adequate assurance that suppliers meet or exceed the Medicare requirements; then CMS will give the organization written notice of its intent to withdraw approval as specified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

(ii) CMS may also provide the organization written notice of its intent to withdraw approval if an equivalency review, onsite observation, or CMS' daily experience with the accreditation organization suggests that the accreditation organization is not meeting the requirements of this section.
