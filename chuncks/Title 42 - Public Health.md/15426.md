####### Burden of proof.

(c)When an enrollee appeals an MA organization's decision to terminate services to an IRE, the burden of proof rests with the MA organization to demonstrate that termination of coverage is the correct decision, either on the basis of medical necessity, or based on other Medicare coverage policies.

(1) To meet this burden, the MA organization must supply any and all information that an IRE requires to sustain the MA organization's termination decision, consistent with paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) The enrollee may submit evidence to be considered by an IRE in making its decision.

(3) The MA organization or an IRE may require an enrollee to authorize release to the IRE of his or her medical records, to the extent that the records are necessary for the MA organization to demonstrate the correctness of its decision or for an IRE to determine the appeal.
