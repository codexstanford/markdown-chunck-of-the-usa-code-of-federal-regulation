####### Change of ownership (CHOW).

(d)(1) CMS may transfer a contract to a successor entity that merges with, or acquires, a contract supplier if the successor entity-

(i) Meets all requirements applicable to contract suppliers for the applicable competitive bidding program;

(ii) Submits to CMS the documentation described under ยง 414.414(b) through (d) if documentation has not previously been submitted by the successor entity or if the documentation is no longer sufficient for CMS to make a financial determination. A successor entity is not required to duplicate previously submitted information if the previously submitted information is not needed to make a financial determination. This documentation must be submitted prior to the effective date of the CHOW; and

(iii) Submits to CMS a signed novation agreement acceptable to CMS stating that it assumes all obligations under the contract. This documentation must be submitted no later than 10 days after the effective date of the CHOW.

(2) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, CMS may transfer the entire contract, including all product categories and competitive bidding areas, to a successor entity.

(3) For contracts issued in the Round 2 Recompete and subsequent rounds in the case of a CHOW where a contract supplier sells a distinct company (for example, a subsidiary) that furnishes a specific product category or services a specific CBA, CMS may transfer the portion of the contract performed by that company to a successor entity, if the following conditions are met:

(i) Every CBA, product category, and location of the company being sold must be transferred to the successor entity that meets all competitive bidding requirements; that is, financial, accreditation, and licensure;

(ii) All CBAs and product categories in the original contract that are not explicitly transferred by CMS remain unchanged in that original contract for the duration of the contract period unless transferred by CMS pursuant to a subsequent CHOW;

(iii) All requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met;

(iv) The sale of the distinct company includes all of the contract supplier's assets associated with the CBA and/or product category(s); and

(v) CMS determines that transfer of part of the original contract will not result in disruption of service or harm to beneficiaries.
