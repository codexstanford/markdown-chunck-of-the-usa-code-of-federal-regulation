(3) In determining the percentage of patients admitted from the referring hospital under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, patients on whose behalf a Medicare outlier payment was made at the referring hospital are not counted toward the applicable threshold.

(4) For purposes of this paragraph, an "MSA-dominant hospital" is a hospital that has discharged more than 25 percent of the total hospital Medicare discharges in the MSA in which the hospital is located.
