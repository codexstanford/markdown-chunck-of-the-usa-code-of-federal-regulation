####### Termination or nonrenewal of agreement by HCPP.

(e)(1) If an HCPP does not wish to renew its agreement at the end of the term, it must give written notice to CMS at least 90 days before the end of the term of the agreement. If an HCPP wishes to terminate its agreement before the end of the term, it must file a written notice with CMS stating the intended effective date of termination.

(2) CMS may approve the termination date proposed by the HCPP, or set a different date no later than 6 months after that date. CMS makes this decision based on a finding that termination on a specific date would not-

(i) Unduly disrupt the furnishing of services to the community serviced by the HCPP; or

(ii) Otherwise interfere with the efficient administration of the Medicare program.
