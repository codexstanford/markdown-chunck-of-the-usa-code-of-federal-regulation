####### Determination of hospital-based facility.

(c)A determination under this paragraph (c) is an initial determination under ยง 498.3 of this chapter. CMS determines that a facility is hospital-based if the-

(1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating decisions of a common governing board. This governing board, which has final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, appoints medical staff, and carries out similar management functions;

(2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of the hospital's chief executive officer and reports through him or her to the governing board;

(3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of the hospital;

(4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing) are integrated with those of the hospital; and

(5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced by the cost report, which reflects allocation of overhead to the facility through the required step-down methodology.
