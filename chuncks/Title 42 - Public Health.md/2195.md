####### Collection of nursing student loans.

(b)(1) Each school at which a fund is established must exercise due diligence in the collection of nursing student loans due the fund. In the exercise of due diligence, a school must follow procedures which are at least as extensive and effective as those used in the collection of other student loan accounts due the school, and must use the steps outlined below in accordance with collection practices which are generally accepted among institutions of higher education:

(i) Conduct and document an entrance interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower prior to disbursing NSL funds in any academic year. During the entrance interview the school must obtain documentation which indicates that the borrower is aware of the rights and responsibilities associated with NSL funds and personal information which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. The requirement of this subparagraph may be met by correspondence if the school determines that a face-to-face meeting (individually or in groups) is impracticable.

(ii) Conduct and document an exit interview (individually or in groups) with the borrower. During the exit interview, the school must provide each borrower with information necessary to carry out the terms of repayment, remind the borrower of the rights and responsibilities associated with NSL funds, and update the personal information collected prior to disbursing NSL funds which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her current address. If the borrower terminates studies without advance notice, the school must document attempts to inform the borrower of the substance of the exit interview and to secure exit interview information from the borrower by mail.

(iii) Notify the borrower in writing of the impending repayment obligation at least twice during the grace period;

(iv) Notify a borrower who is in deferment status in writing of the impending repayment obligation 1 to 3 months prior to the expiration of the approved period of deferment;

(v) Perform regular billing;

(vi) Follow up past due payments with a series of at least four documented and reasonably spaced attempts to contact the borrower, at least three of which must be in writing at not more than 30-day intervals, prior to the loan becoming 120 days past due, provided that the school has a current address for the borrower;

(vii) Perform address searches when necessary;

(viii) Use collection agents, which may include the use of an internal collection agent;

(ix) Institute legal proceedings against borrowers after all other attempts at collection have failed, unless the school determines, subject to the approval of the Secretary, that such litigation would not be cost-effective; and

(x) Become a member of a credit bureau and notify the credit bureau of accounts past due by more than 120 days.
