######## Total duplicate RT services amount.

(2)CMS calculates the total duplicate RT services amount by adding all FFS amounts for duplicate RT services furnished during each episode initiated in the PY. The duplicate RT services amount is capped for each episode and will not be more than the participant-specific professional episode payment amount or participant-specific technical episode payment amount received by the RO participant for an RO episode, even if the duplicate RT services amount exceeds the participant-specific professional episode payment amount or the participant-specific technical episode payment amount.
