####### Consideration of mitigating factors in initial approval survey, certification, and enforcement actions for transplant programs,Factors.

(e)-(1)Except for situations of immediate jeopardy or deficiencies other than failure to meet requirements at ยง 482.80 of this chapter, CMS will consider such mitigating factors as may be appropriate in light of the nature of the deficiency and circumstances, including (but not limited to) the following, in making a decision of initial approval of a transplant program that does not meet the data submission, clinical experience, or outcome requirements:

(i) The extent to which outcome measures are not met or exceeded;

(ii) Availability of Medicare-approved transplant centers in the area;

(iii) Extenuating circumstances (for example, natural disaster) that have a temporary effect on meeting the conditions of participation;

(iv) Program improvements that substantially address root causes of graft failures or patient deaths, that have been implemented and institutionalized on a sustainable basis, and that are supported by outcomes more recent than the latest available SRTR report, for which there is a sufficient post-transplant patient and graft survival period and a sufficient number of transplants such that CMS finds that the program demonstrates present-day compliance with the requirements at ยง 482.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) of this chapter;

(v) Whether the program has made extensive use of innovative transplantation practices relative to other transplant programs, such as a high rate of transplantation of individuals who are highly sensitized or children who have undergone a Fontan procedure compared to most other transplant programs, where CMS finds that the innovative practices are supported by evidence-based published research literature or nationally recognized standards or Institution Review Board (IRB) approvals, and the SRTR risk-adjustment methodology does not take the relevant key factors into consideration; and

(vi) Whether the program's performance, based on the OPTN method of calculating patient and graft survival, is within the OPTN's thresholds for acceptable performance and does not flag OPTN performance review under the applicable OPTN policy.
