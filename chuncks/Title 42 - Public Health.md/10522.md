####### Sale of replacement or restored assets.

(8)If a provider sells a replacement or restored asset while participating in the Medicare program or within 1 year immediately following the date on which it terminates its participation in the Medicare program, the unrecovered loss entered on the books of the provider as a deferred charge in accordance with paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section will not be included in determining the gain or loss realized from the sale of the replacement or restored asset. However, if the sale of such asset is made to a related organization, as defined in ยง 413.17, and the purchasing organization continues as a provider in the Medicare program, the remaining deferred charge representing the unrecovered depreciable basis of the demolished, abandoned or destroyed asset must continue to be amortized over the remaining expected useful life of the replacement or restored asset. If the sale is made to an unrelated organization, further amortization of the deferred charge is not allowed.
