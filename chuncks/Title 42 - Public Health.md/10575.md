###### ยง 413.157 Return on equity capital of proprietary providers.
####### Acquisitions prior to August 1970.

(3)With respect to a facility or any tangible assets of a facility acquired before August 1970, the excess of the price paid for such facility or assets over the fair market value of tangible assets at the time of purchase is includable in equity capital to the extent that it is reasonable except that the cumulative allowable return for such excess may not exceed 100 percent of such excess. For purposes of this section, the cumulative allowable return means the sum of the allowable rate of return on equity capital for all months starting from August 1, 1970. For example, if the allowable rates of return on equity capital for a provider are 9 percent for the first year (and such year started August 1, 1970), 8.5 percent for the second year, and 10.5 percent for the third year, the cumulative allowable return at the end of the third year would be 28 percent. After the cumulative allowable return equals 100 percent, the inclusion in equity capital of the excess is no longer allowable.
