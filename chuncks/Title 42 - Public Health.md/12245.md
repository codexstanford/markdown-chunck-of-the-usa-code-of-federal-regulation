() Beginning with the 2020 MIPS payment year, for the quality, cost, and improvement activities performance categories, CMS determines, based on information known to the agency prior to the beginning of the relevant MIPS payment year, that data for a MIPS eligible clinician are inaccurate, unusable or otherwise compromised due to circumstances outside of the control of the clinician and its agents.

(B) Under section 1848(q)(5)(E)(ii) of the Act, CMS estimates that the proportion of MIPS eligible clinicians who are physicians as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act and earn a Promoting Interoperability performance category score of at least 75 percent is 75 percent or greater. The estimation is based on data from the performance period that occurs four years before the MIPS payment year and does not include physicians for whom the Promoting Interoperability performance category is weighted at zero percent.
