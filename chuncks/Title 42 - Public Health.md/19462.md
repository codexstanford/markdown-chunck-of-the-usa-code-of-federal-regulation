(2) Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act (in clause (II) following subparagraph (D)), allows the State to pay the premium, deductibles, cost sharing, and other charges for beneficiaries enrolled under Medicare Part B without obligating itself to provide the range of Part B benefits to other beneficiaries; and

(i) Specifies the exception, relating to Part B coverage, from the requirement to provide comparable services to all beneficiaries; and

(ii) Prescribes FFP rules concerning State payment for Medicare premiums and for services that could have been covered under Medicare.

(5) Section 1902(a)(15) of the Act requires that if a State chooses to pay only a portion of deductibles, cost sharing or other charges for beneficiaries enrolled under Medicare Part B, the portion that is to be paid by a Medicaid beneficiary must be reasonably related to the beneficiary's income and resources.
