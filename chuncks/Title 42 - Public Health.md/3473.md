####### Open-circuit apparatus.

(a)(1) The concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas in open-circuit apparatus will be measured at the mouth while the apparatus mounted on a dummy head is operated by a breathing machine. An acceptable method for measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide is described in Bureau of Mines Report of Investigations 6865, A Machine-Test Method for Measuring Carbon Dioxide in the Inspired Air of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, 1966. Copies of Report of Investigations 6865 may be inspected or obtained from the NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, P.O. Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236.

(2) The breathing rate will be 14.5 respirations per minute with a minute-volume of 10.5 liters.

(3) A sedentary breathing machine cam will be used.

(4) The apparatus will be tested at a temperature of 27 +/-2 &#xB0;C. (80 +/-5 &#xB0;F.).

(5) A concentration of 5 percent carbon dioxide in air will be exhaled into the facepiece.
