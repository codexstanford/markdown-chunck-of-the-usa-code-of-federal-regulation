####### Record retention standard.

(b)(1) An endorsed sponsor must retain records that it creates, collects, or maintains while participating in the Medicare Drug Discount Card and Transitional Assistance Program as part of its operations of an endorsed program for at least 6 years following termination of such program, or, in the event the endorsed sponsor's endorsement is terminated under § 420.820(c), (d), or (e) of this chapter at least 6 years following termination of such endorsement. The Secretary may extend the six-year retention period if an endorsed sponsor's records relate to an ongoing investigation, litigation, or negotiation by the Secretary, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, or a State, or such documents otherwise relate to suspicions of fraud and abuse or violations of Federal or State law.

(2) For the period during which an endorsed sponsor retains records as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an endorsed sponsor must continue to apply security and privacy protections to such records and the information contained therein to the same extent endorsed sponsors are required to do so under §§ 403.812(b) and 403.812(c)(1) prior to termination.
