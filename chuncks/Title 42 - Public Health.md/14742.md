###### ยง 422.264 Calculation of savings.
####### Risk adjustment factors for determination of savings for local plans.

(c)CMS will publish the first Monday in April before the upcoming calendar year the risk adjustment factors described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section determined for the purpose of calculating savings amounts for MA local plans.

(1) For the purpose of calculating savings for MA local plans CMS has the authority to apply risk adjustment factors that are plan-specific average risk adjustment factors, Statewide average risk adjustment factors, or factors determined on a basis other than plan-specific factors or Statewide average factors.

(2) In the event that CMS applies Statewide average risk adjustment factors, the statewide factor for each State is the average of the risk factors calculated under ยง 422.308(c), based on all enrollees in MA local plans in that State in the previous year. In the case of a State in which no local MA plan was offered in the previous year, CMS will estimate an average and may base this average on average risk adjustment factors applied to comparable States or applied on a national basis.
