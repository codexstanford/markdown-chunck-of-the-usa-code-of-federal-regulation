###### ยง 417.576 Final settlement.
####### Final determination and adjustment.

(c)(1) After receipt of acceptable reports as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, CMS determines the total payment due the HMO or CMP for furnishing covered services to its Medicare enrollees (which is subject to the audit provisions of this subpart) and makes a retroactive adjustment to bring interim payments into agreement with the payable amount due the HMO or CMP.

(2) A final settlement may be made with the HMO or CMP even though a provider that is not owned or operated by the HMO or CMP or related to the HMO or CMP by common ownership or control and that provides services to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees has not had a final settlement with CMS under parts 412 and 413 of this chapter for services furnished by the provider to Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in the HMO or CMP. In this situation-

(i) CMS must be satisfied that the costs of covered services furnished to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, as shown in the reports specified in paragraph (b) of this section, are reasonable and that the interest of the Medicare program would best be served by not delaying final settlement with the HMO or CMP until there is a final settlement with the provider for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in the HMO or CMP; and

(ii) Prompt settlement with the HMO or CMP would be in the best interest of the Medicare program if, for instance, the provider's costs represent an insignificant portion of total payment due to the HMO or CMP; or if CMS is satisfied that the provider's costs, as shown in the reports specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will not be modified, to any significant extent, by the final settlement with the provider under parts 412 and 413 of this chapter.
