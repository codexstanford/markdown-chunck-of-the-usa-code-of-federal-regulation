####### Claims filing requirements.

(f)(1) CMS may recover without regard to any claims filing requirements that the insurance program or plan imposes on the beneficiary or other claimant such as a time limit for filing a claim or a time limit for notifying the plan or program about the need for or receipt of services.

(2) However, CMS will not recover its payment for particular services in the face of a claims filing requirement unless it has filed a claim for recovery by the end of the year following the year in which the Medicare intermediary or carrier that paid the claim has notice that the third party is a primary plan to Medicare for those particular services. (A notice received during the last three months of a year is considered received during the following year.)
