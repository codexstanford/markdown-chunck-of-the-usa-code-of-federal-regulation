####### Adjustment for the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals.

(6)The standard Federal payment rate determined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is adjusted as follows:

(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2018 and before October 1, 2019, by a one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2019, and the portion of estimated aggregate payments to site neutral cases that are paid based on the LTCH PPS standard Federal rate in FY 2019, are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals. This adjustment only applies to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the standard Federal payment rate for a subsequent fiscal year.

(ii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2019 and before October 1, 2020, by a one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2020, and the portion of estimated aggregate payments to site neutral payment rate cases that are paid based on the LTCH PPS standard Federal rate in FY 2020, are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals. This adjustment only applies to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the standard Federal payment rate for a subsequent fiscal year.

(iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2020, by a permanent, one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2021 are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals.
