####### Completion date

means, for a clinical trial, including an applicable clinical trial, the date that the final subject was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical trial concluded according to the pre-specified protocol or was terminated. In the case of clinical trials with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all of the primary outcomes. For a pediatric postmarket surveillance of a device product that is not a clinical trial, completion date means the date on which the final report of the pediatric postmarket surveillance of the device product is submitted to FDA. For purposes of this part, completion date is referred to as "primary completion date."
