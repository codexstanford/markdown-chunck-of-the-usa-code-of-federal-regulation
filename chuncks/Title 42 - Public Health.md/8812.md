####### Number of discharges.

(2)(i) CMS sets forth the national and regional number of discharges in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates published under ยง 412.8(b). The methodology CMS uses to calculate these criteria is described in paragraph (i) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for an osteopathic hospital, for the hospital's cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under paragraph (i) of this section, its number of discharges (not including discharges from units excluded from the prospective payments system under subpart B of this part or from newborn units) is at least equal to-

(A) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before October 1, 1986, the number of discharges under either the national or regional criterion; or

(B) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, 5,000 discharges or, if less, the median number of discharges for urban hospitals located in each region.

(ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1986, an osteopathic hospital, recognized by the American Osteopathic Healthcare Association (or any successor organization), that is located in a rural area must have at least 3,000 discharges during its cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under paragraph (i) of this section to meet the number of discharges criterion.

(iii) If the hospital's cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under paragraph (i) of this section is for less than 12 months or longer than 12 months, the hospital's number of discharges for that cost reporting period will be annualized to estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost reporting period.
