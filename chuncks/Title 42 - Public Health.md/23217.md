######## Use of criteria.

(b)In assessing the need for and appropriateness of an inpatient health care facility stay, a QIO must apply criteria to determine-

(1) The necessity for facility admission and continued stay (in cases of day outliers in hospitals under prospective payment);

(2) The necessity for surgery and other invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; or

(3) The appropriateness of providing services at a particular health care facility or at a particular level of care. The QIO must determine whether the beneficiary requires the level of care received or whether a lower and less costly level of care would be equally effective.
