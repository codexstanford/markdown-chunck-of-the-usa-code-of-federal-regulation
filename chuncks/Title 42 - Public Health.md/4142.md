###### ยง 110.81 Calculation of benefits for lost employment income.
####### Reductions for other coverage.

(d)From the amount of benefits calculated under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary will make reductions:

(1) For all payments made, or expected to be made in the future, to the injured countermeasure recipient for compensation of lost employment income or disability or retirement benefits, by any third-party payer in relation to the covered injury or its health complications, consistent with ยง 110.32(b); and

(2) So that the total amount of benefits for lost employment income paid to an injured countermeasure recipient under this Program, together with the total amounts paid (or payable) by third-party payers, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, does not exceed 66percent (or 75 percent, if the injured countermeasure recipient had at least one dependent at the time the covered injury was sustained) of his or her employment income at the time of the covered injury for the lost work days.

(3) If an injured countermeasure recipient receives a lump-sum payment from any third-party payer under any obligation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider such a payment to be received over a period of years, rather than in a single year. The Secretary has discretion as to how to apportion such payments over multiple years.
