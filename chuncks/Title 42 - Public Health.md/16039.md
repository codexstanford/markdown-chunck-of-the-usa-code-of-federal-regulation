####### Differential cost-sharing for preferred pharmacies.

(9)A Part D sponsor offering a Part D plan that provides coverage other than defined standard coverage may reduce copayments or coinsurance for covered Part D drugs obtained through a preferred pharmacy relative to the copayments or coinsurance applicable for such drugs when obtained through a non-preferred pharmacy. Such differentials are taken into account in determining whether the requirements under ยง 423.104(d)(2) and (d)(5) and ยง 423.104(e) are met. Any cost-sharing reduction under this section must not increase CMS payments to the Part D plan under ยง 423.329.
