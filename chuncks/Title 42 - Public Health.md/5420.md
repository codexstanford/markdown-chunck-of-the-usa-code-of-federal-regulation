(b)(1) In consideration of a recommendation by the State survey agency or Accrediting Organization, or at the discretion of the Secretary, may waive, for periods deemed appropriate, specific provisions of the Life Safety Code, which would result in unreasonable hardship upon a RNHCI facility, but only if the waiver will not adversely affect the health and safety of the patients.

(2) If CMS finds that the fire and safety code imposed by State law adequately protects patients in the institution, the provisions of the Life Safety Code required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply in that State.
