() For performance year 2023, an ACO in Level A under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A)() of this section or in Level B under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A)() of this section may elect to remain in the same level of the BASIC track's glide path in which it participated during performance year 2022, for the remainder of the agreement period, unless the ACO elects to transition to a higher level of risk and potential reward within the BASIC track's glide path as provided in ยง 425.226(a)(2)(i). If the ACO does not elect to remain under Level A or Level B, for performance year 2023, the ACO is automatically advanced to the next level of the BASIC track's glide path to which the ACO would have automatically advanced absent any election to maintain its participation level for performance year 2022 under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)()() of this section and, if applicable, the election to maintain its participation level for performance year 2021 under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B)()() of this section, unless the ACO elects to transition to a higher level of risk and potential reward within the BASIC track's glide path as provided in ยง 425.226(a)(2)(i). A voluntary election by an ACO under this paragraph must be made in the form and manner and by a deadline established by CMS.
