(b)To compute an average per capita expenditure amount for the ACO's regional service area, CMS does all of the following:

(1) Determines the counties included in the ACO's regional service area based on the ACO's BY3 assigned beneficiary population.

(2) Determines the ACO's regional expenditures as specified under ยง 425.654 for BY3.

(3) Adjusts for differences in severity and case mix between the ACO's assigned beneficiary population for BY3 and the assignable population of beneficiaries for the ACO's regional service area for BY3. The assignable population of beneficiaries is identified using the assignment window corresponding to BY3 that is consistent with the assignment window that applies under the beneficiary assignment methodology selected by the ACO for the performance year according to ยง 425.400(a)(4)(ii).
