###### ยง 413.99 Qualified and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans.
####### Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (QDBP)

means a type of Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan that is established and maintained by the employer primarily to provide definitely determinable benefits to its employees usually over a period of years, or for life, after retirement. Such benefits are generally measured by, and based on, such factors as age of employees, years of service, and compensation received by the employees. A QDBP meets the applicable requirements of ERISA, as amended, and the requirements for a QDBP under 26 U.S.C. 401(a). Under a qualified plan, employers are entitled to deduct expenses in the year the employer makes contributions even though employees will not recognize income until the receipt of distributions.
