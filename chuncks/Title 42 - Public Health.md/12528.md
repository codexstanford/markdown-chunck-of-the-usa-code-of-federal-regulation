####### General rule.

(a)If a resident participates in a service furnished in a teaching setting, physician fee schedule payment is made only if a teaching physician is present during the key portion of any service or procedure for which payment is sought. In residency training sites that are located outside a metropolitan statistical area, physician fee schedule payment may also be made if a teaching physician is present during the key portion of the service, including for Medicare telehealth services, through audio/video real-time communications technology for any service or procedure for which payment is sought. For all teaching settings during the Public Health Emergency, as defined in § 400.200 of this chapter, for the COVID-19 pandemic, if a resident participates in a service furnished in a teaching setting, physician fee schedule payment is made if a teaching physician is present during the key portion of the service including for Medicare telehealth services, through audio/video real-time communications technology for any service or procedure for which payment is sought.

(1) In the case of surgical, high-risk, or other complex procedures, the teaching physician must be present during all critical portions of the procedure and immediately available to furnish services during the entire service or procedure.

(i) In the case of surgery, the teaching physician's presence is not required during opening and closing of the surgical field.

(2) In the case of evaluation and management services, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), the teaching physician must be present in person during the portion of the service that determines the level of service billed. (However, in the case of evaluation and management services furnished in hospital outpatient departments and certain other ambulatory settings, the requirements of § 415.174 apply.)
