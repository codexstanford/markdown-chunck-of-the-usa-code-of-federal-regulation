####### Classification methodology.

(a)(1) A patient classification system is used to classify patients in inpatient rehabilitation facilities into mutually exclusive case-mix groups.

(2) For purposes of this subpart, case-mix groups are classes of Medicare patient discharges by functional-related groups that are based on a patient's impairment, age, comorbidities, functional capabilities, and other factors that may improve the ability of the functional-related groups to estimate variations in resource use.

(3) Data from admission assessments under ยง 412.610(c)(1) are used to classify a Medicare patient into an appropriate case-mix group.

(4) Data from the discharge assessment under ยง 412.610(c)(2) are used to determine the weighting factors under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
