####### Baseline number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds

means the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds for which the applicable hospital or high Medicaid facility is licensed as of March 23, 2010 (or, in the case of a hospital that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of such date, but does have a provider agreement in effect on December 31, 2010, the date of effect of such agreement). For purposes of determining the number of beds in a hospital's baseline number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds, a bed is included if the bed is considered licensed for purposes of State licensure, regardless of the specific number of beds identified on the physical license issued to the hospital by the State.
