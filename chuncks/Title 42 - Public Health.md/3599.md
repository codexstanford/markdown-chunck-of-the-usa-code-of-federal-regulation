###### ยง 84.302 Required components, attributes, and instructions.

(a) Each CCER must include components and/or attributes appropriate to its design, as follows:

(1) Eye protection: Each CCER must include safety goggles or an escape hood lens that protects against impact, fogging, and permeation by gas, vapor, and smoke, as specified under ยง 84.308(c);

(2) Thermal exposure indicators: If the manufacturer specifies a maximum and/or minimum environmental temperature limit for storage of the CCER, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can determine whether the CCER has been exposed to temperatures that exceed the limit(s);

(3) Chemical bed physical integrity indicators: If the CCER includes a chemical oxygen storage or chemical carbon dioxide scrubber that can be functionally damaged by impact, vibration, or any other environmental factor to which the CCER might be exposed, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect any damage or alteration of the chemical oxygen storage or chemical carbon dioxide scrubber that could diminish the NIOSH-certified performance of the CCER, as tested under this subpart;

(4) Oxygen storage vessel: If the CCER includes an oxygen storage vessel, the vessel must be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 CFR part 107, "Hazardous Materials Program Procedures," unless exempted under subpart B of 49 CFR part 107;

(5) Tamper-resistant/tamper-evident casing: If the CCER is not designed for its casing to be opened prior to use for an actual escape (e.g., for maintenance, escape drills, or inspection of the components), the casing must include a component, an attribute, or other means to prevent a person from accidentally opening the casing and, upon such opening, to either prevent the casing from being closed or to clearly indicate to a potential user that the casing has been previously opened; and

(6) Moisture damage indicators: If the CCER is not designed for its casing to be opened for inspection of its internal components, the casing must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect any ingress of water or water vapor that could diminish the NIOSH-certified performance, as tested under this subpart.

(7) Oxygen starter indicators: If the oxygen starter is a critical component of the CCER design, then the CCER must include a component, an attribute, or other means by which a person can detect observable damage, premature activation, or recognized potential defect of the starter.

(b) Where an indicator is required, the indication of the occurrence of the monitored condition must be clear and unambiguous: It must not depend on a subjective interpretation of subtle, graduated, or other non-discrete changes to the indicator.

(c) Where an indicator is required, the manufacturer shall provide NIOSH with an explanation of its function and operation, and shall provide relevant data and equipment to allow NIOSH to conduct a thorough evaluation of its accuracy and reliability.

(d) The components of each CCER must meet the general construction requirements specified in ยง 84.61.
