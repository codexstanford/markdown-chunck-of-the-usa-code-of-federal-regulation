###### § 422.107 Requirements for dual eligible special needs plans.
####### Additional opportunities in certain integrated care programs.

(e)(1) CMS facilitates operationalization as described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section if a State Medicaid agency requires MA organizations offering dual eligible special needs plans with exclusively aligned enrollment to do both of the following:

(i) Apply for, and seek CMS approval to establish and maintain, one or more MA contracts that only include one or more dual eligible special needs plans with a service area limited to that State.

(ii) Use required materials that integrate Medicare and Medicaid content, including at a minimum the Summary of Benefits, Formulary, and combined Provider and Pharmacy Directory that meets Medicare and Medicaid managed care requirements consistent with applicable regulations in parts 422, 423, and 438 of this chapter.

(2) The requirements, processes, and procedures applicable to dual eligible special needs plans and the MA program, including for applications, bids, and contracting procedures under §§ 422.250 through 422.530, remain applicable. Because implementation of the contract provisions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may require administrative steps that cannot be completed between reviewing the contract and the start of the plan year, CMS begins good faith work following receipt of a letter from the State Medicaid agency indicating intent to include the provisions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section in a future contract year and collaborate with CMS on implementation.

(3) When the conditions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section are met-

(i) Following a State request, CMS grants access for State Medicaid agency officials to the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) (or its successor) for purposes of oversight and information-sharing related to the MA contract(s) described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, as long as State Medicaid agency officials agree to protect the proprietary nature of information to which the State Medicaid agency may not otherwise have direct access. State access to the Health Plan Management System (or its successor) is subject to compliance with HHS and CMS policies and standards and with applicable laws in the use of HPMS data and the system's functionality. CMS may terminate a State official's access to the Health Plan Management System (or its successor) if any policy is violated or if information is not adequately protected; and

(ii) CMS coordinates with States on program audits, including information-sharing on major audit findings and coordination of audits schedules for the D-SNPs subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
