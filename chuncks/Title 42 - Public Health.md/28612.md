####### Care coordination arrangements to improve quality, health outcomes, and efficiency.

(ee)As used in section 1128B of the Act, "remuneration" does not include the exchange of anything of value between a VBE and VBE participant or between VBE participants pursuant to a value-based arrangement if all of the standards in paragraphs (ee)(1) through (13) of this section are met:

(1) The remuneration exchanged:

(i) Is in-kind;

(ii) Is used predominantly to engage in value-based activities that are directly connected to the coordination and management of care for the target patient population and does not result in more than incidental benefits to persons outside of the target patient population; and

(iii) Is not exchanged or used:

(A) More than incidentally for the recipient's billing or financial management services; or

(B) For the purpose of marketing items or services furnished by the VBE or a VBE participant to patients or for patient recruitment activities.

(2) The value-based arrangement is commercially reasonable, considering both the arrangement itself and all value-based arrangements within the VBE.

(3) The terms of the value-based arrangement are set forth in writing and signed by the parties in advance of, or contemporaneous with, the commencement of the value-based arrangement and any material change to the value-based arrangement. The writing states at a minimum:

(i) The value-based purpose(s) of the value-based activities provided for in the value-based arrangement;

(ii) The value-based activities to be undertaken by the parties to the value-based arrangement;

(iii) The term of the value-based arrangement;

(iv) The target patient population;

(v) A description of the remuneration;

(vi) Either the offeror's cost for the remuneration and the reasonable accounting methodology used by the offeror to determine its cost, or the fair market value of the remuneration;

(vii) The percentage and amount contributed by the recipient;

(viii) If applicable, the frequency of the recipient's contribution payments for ongoing costs; and

(ix) The outcome or process measure(s) against which the recipient will be measured.

(4) The parties to the value-based arrangement establish one or more legitimate outcome or process measures that:

(i) The parties reasonably anticipate will advance the coordination and management of care for the target patient population based on clinical evidence or credible medical or health sciences support;

(ii) Include one or more benchmarks that are related to improving or maintaining improvements in the coordination and management of care for the target patient population;

(iii) Are monitored, periodically assessed, and prospectively revised as necessary to ensure that the measure and its benchmark continue to advance the coordination and management of care of the target patient population;

(iv) Relate to the remuneration exchanged under the value-based arrangement; and

(v) Are not based solely on patient satisfaction or patient convenience.

(5) The offeror of the remuneration does not take into account the volume or value of, or condition the remuneration on:

(i) Referrals of patients who are not part of the target patient population; or

(ii) Business not covered under the value-based arrangement.

(6) The recipient pays at least 15 percent of the offeror's cost for the remuneration, using any reasonable accounting methodology, or the fair market value of the in-kind remuneration. If it is a one-time cost, the recipient makes such contribution in advance of receiving the in-kind remuneration. If it is an ongoing cost, the recipient makes such contribution at reasonable, regular intervals.

(7) The value-based arrangement does not:

(i) Limit the VBE participant's ability to make decisions in the best interests of its patients;

(ii) Direct or restrict referrals to a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier if:

(A) A patient expresses a preference for a different practitioner, provider, or supplier;

(B) The patient's payor determines the provider, practitioner, or supplier; or

(C) Such direction or restriction is contrary to applicable law under titles XVIII and XIX of the Act; or

(iii) Induce parties to furnish medically unnecessary items or services, or reduce or limit medically necessary items or services furnished to any patient.

(8) The exchange of remuneration by a limited technology participant and another VBE participant or the VBE must not be conditioned on any recipient's exclusive use or minimum purchase of any item or service manufactured, distributed, or sold by the limited technology participant.

(9) The VBE, a VBE participant in the value-based arrangement acting on the VBE's behalf, or the VBE's accountable body or responsible person reasonably monitors and assesses the following and reports the monitoring and assessment of the following to the VBE's accountable body or responsible person, as applicable, no less frequently than annually or at least once during the term of the value-based arrangement for arrangements with terms of less than 1 year:

(i) The coordination and management of care for the target patient population in the value-based arrangement;

(ii) Any deficiencies in the delivery of quality care under the value-based arrangement; and

(iii) Progress toward achieving the legitimate outcome or process measure(s) in the value-based arrangement.

(10) If the VBE's accountable body or responsible person determines, based on the monitoring and assessment conducted pursuant to paragraph (ee)(9) of this section, that the value-based arrangement has resulted in material deficiencies in quality of care or is unlikely to further the coordination and management of care for the target patient population, the parties must within 60 days either:

(i) Terminate the arrangement; or

(ii) Develop and implement a corrective action plan designed to remedy the deficiencies within 120 days, and if the corrective action plan fails to remedy the deficiencies within 120 days, terminate the value-based arrangement.

(11) The offeror does not and should not know that the remuneration is likely to be diverted, resold, or used by the recipient for an unlawful purpose.

(12) For a period of at least 6 years, the VBE or VBE participant makes available to the Secretary, upon request, all materials and records sufficient to establish compliance with the conditions of this paragraph (ee).

(13) The remuneration is not exchanged by:

(i) A pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;

(ii) A pharmacy benefit manager;

(iii) A laboratory company;

(iv) A pharmacy that primarily compounds drugs or primarily dispenses compounded drugs;

(v) Except to the extent the entity is a limited technology participant, a manufacturer of a device or medical supply;

(vi) Except to the extent the entity or individual is a limited technology participant, an entity or individual that sells or rents durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, or supplies covered by a Federal health care program (other than a pharmacy or a physician, provider, or other entity that primarily furnishes services); or

(vii) A medical device distributor or wholesaler that is not otherwise a manufacturer of a device or medical supplies.
