###### ยง 412.624 Methodology for calculating the Federal prospective payment rates.
####### Adjustment for area wage levels.

(1)The labor portion of a facility's Federal prospective payment is adjusted to account for geographical differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index.

(i) The application of the wage index is made on the basis of the location of the facility in an urban or rural area as defined in ยง 412.602.

(ii) Starting on October 1, 2022, CMS applies a cap on decreases to the wage index such that the wage index applied to an IRF is not less than 95 percent of the wage index applied to that IRF in the prior FY.

(iii) Adjustments or updates to the wage data used to adjust a facility's Federal prospective payment rate under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be made in a budget neutral manner. CMS determines a budget neutral wage adjustment factor, based on any adjustment or update to the wage data, to apply to the standard payment conversion factor.
