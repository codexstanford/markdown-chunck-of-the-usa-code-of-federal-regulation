###### ยง 414.1370 APM scoring standard under MIPS.
####### APM Entity group scoring under the APM scoring standard.

(f)The MIPS final score calculated for the APM Entity is applied to each MIPS eligible clinician in the APM Entity group. The MIPS payment adjustment is applied at the TIN/NPI level for each of the MIPS eligible clinicians in the APM Entity group.

(1) If a Shared Savings Program ACO does not report data on quality measures as required by the Shared Savings Program under ยง 425.508 of this chapter, each ACO participant TIN will be treated as a unique APM Entity for purposes of the APM scoring standard and the ACO participant TINs may report data for the MIPS quality performance category according to the MIPS submission and reporting requirements.

(2) MIPS eligible clinicians who participate in a group or have elected to participate in a virtual group and who are also on a MIPS APM Participation List will be included in the assessment under MIPS for purposes of producing a group or virtual group score and under the APM scoring standard for purposes of producing an APM Entity score. The MIPS payment adjustment for these eligible clinicians is based solely on their APM Entity score; if the APM Entity group is exempt from MIPS all eligible clinicians within that APM Entity group are also exempt from MIPS.
