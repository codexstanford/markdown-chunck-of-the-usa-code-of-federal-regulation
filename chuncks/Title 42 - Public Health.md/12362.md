####### Capitation.

(7)A full capitation arrangement meets this Other Payer Advanced APM criterion. For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a full capitation arrangement means a payment arrangement in which a per capita or otherwise predetermined payment is made under the payment arrangement for all items and services furnished to a population of beneficiaries during a fixed period of time, and no settlement is performed for the purposes of reconciling or sharing losses incurred or savings earned by the participant. Arrangements made directly between CMS and Medicare Advantage Organizations under the Medicare Advantage program (part 422 of this title) are not considered capitation arrangements for purposes of this paragraph.
