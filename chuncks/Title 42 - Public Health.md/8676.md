####### Right to administrative and judicial review.

(b)(1) An intermediary's estimation of a hospital's base-year costs, and modifications, made for purposes of determining the hospital-specific rate, are subject to administrative and judicial review. Review will be available to a hospital upon receipt of its notice of amount of program reimbursement following the close of its cost reporting period, but only with respect to whether the intermediary followed the provisions of §§ 412.71 and 412.72. (Sections 405.1803 and 405.1807 of this chapter set forth the rules for intermediary determinations and notice of amount of program reimbursement and the effect of those determinations.)

(2) In any administrative or judicial review of whether the intermediary used the best data available at the time, as required by § 412.71(d), an intermediary's estimation will be revised on the basis of this review only if the estimation was unreasonable and clearly erroneous in light of the data available at the time the estimation was made.

(3) Specifically excluded from administrative or judicial review are any issues based on data, information, or arguments not presented to the intermediary at the time of the estimation.
