######## Case-mix adjustment,Determining transfer-adjusted case mix value. Step 1:

(c)-(1)For base year cost reporting periods ending on or before December 31, 1990, CMS uses the base year MEDPAR data received as of June 30, 1991 to determine the hospital's transfer-adjusted case-mix value. For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 1990 and beginning before October 1, 1991, CMS determines a transfer-adjusted case-mix value for a hospital using the applicable base year MEDPAR data on file as of the December 31 or June 30 occurring at least 6 months after the close of the base year. For base year cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary determines the transfer-adjusted case-mix value based on the most recent billing data available as of the date of the final determination of the hospital-specific rate. CMS or the intermediary, as appropriate, multiplies the DRG weight for each case by one of the following factors:

(i) If the case is not a transfer, the factor equals 1.0.

(ii) If the case is a transfer, the factor equals the lesser of 1.0 or the ratio of the length of stay for the case divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG.
