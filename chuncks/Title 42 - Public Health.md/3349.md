##### Subpart C - Procedures for Adding Classes of Employees to the Cohort
###### § 83.13 How will NIOSH evaluate petitions, other than petitions by claimants covered under § 83.14?
####### Is there a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of the class?,"there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of the class"

(3)If it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy radiation doses for members of the class, as provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then NIOSH must determine, as required by the statute, that(42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)(2)).

(i) For classes of employees that may have been exposed to radiation during discrete incidents likely to have involved exceptionally high level exposures, such as nuclear criticality incidents or other events involving similarly high levels of exposures resulting from the failure of radiation protection controls, NIOSH will assume for the purposes of this section that any duration of unprotected exposure could cause a specified cancer, and hence may have endangered the health of members of the class. Presence with potential exposure during the discrete incident, rather than a quantified duration of potential exposure, will satisfy the health endangerment criterion.

(ii) For health endangerment not established on the basis of a discrete incident, as described under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, NIOSH will specify a minimum duration of employment to satisfy the health endangerment criterion as having been employed for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days within the parameters established for the class or in combination with work days within the parameters established for one or more other classes of employees in the Cohort.

(d) NIOSH will submit a report of its evaluation findings to the Board and to the petitioner(s). The report will include the following elements:

(1) An identification of the relevant petitions;

(2) A proposed definition of the class or classes of employees to which the evaluation applies, and a summary of the basis for this definition, including, as necessary:

(i) Any justification that may be needed for the inclusion of groups of employees who were not specified in the original petition(s);

(ii) The identification of any groups of employees who were identified in the original petition(s) who should constitute a separate class of employees; or

(iii) The merging of multiple petitions that represent a single class of employees;

(3) The proposed class definition will address the following employment parameters:

(i) The DOE facility or the AWE facility that employed the class;

(ii) The job titles and/or job duties and/or work locations of class members;

(iii) The period of employment within which a class member must have been employed at the facility under the job titles and/or performing the job duties and/or working in the locations specified in this class definition;

(iv) If applicable, identification of an exposure incident, when potential radiation exposure during such an incident comprises the basis of the class definition;

(v) If necessary, any other parameters that serve to define the membership of the class; and

(vi) For a class for which it is not feasible to estimate radiation doses with sufficient accuracy, a minimum duration of employment within the parameters of the class for inclusion in the class, as defined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;

(4) A summary of the findings concerning the adequacy of existing records and information for reconstructing doses for individual members of the class under the methods of 42 CFR part 82 specifying, for each class defined in the report, whether NIOSH finds that it is feasible to estimate the radiation doses of members of the class with sufficient accuracy, and a description of the evaluation methods and information upon which these findings are based; and

(5) For a class for which it is not feasible to estimate radiation doses with sufficient accuracy, a summary of the basis for establishing the duration of employment requirement with respect to health endangerment.

(e) The NIOSH report under paragraph (d) of this section shall be completed within 180 calendar days of the receipt of the petition by NIOSH. The procedure for computing this time period is specified in § 83.5(c). In addition, the computing of 180 calendar days shall not include any days during which the petitioner may be revising the petition to remedy deficiencies identified by NIOSH under § 83.11(a) or (b), nor shall it include any days during which the petitioner may request a review of a proposed finding under § 83.11(c) or during the conduct of such a review under § 83.11(d).
