() For fiscal year 2017, CMS will base its estimates of the amount of hospital uncompensated care on utilization data for Medicaid and Medicare SSI patients, as determined by CMS in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (4) of this section, using data on Medicaid utilization from 2011, 2012, and 2013 cost reports from the most recent HCRIS database extract, the 2011 and 2012 cost report data submitted to CMS by IHS hospitals, and the most recent available 3 years of data on Medicare SSI utilization (or, for Puerto Rico hospitals, a proxy for Medicare SSI utilization data).
