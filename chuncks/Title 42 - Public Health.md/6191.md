####### ยง 405.1110 Council reviews on its own motion.
######## Council's action.

(d)If the Council decides to review a decision or dismissal on its own motion, it will mail the results of its action to all the parties to the hearing and to CMS if it is not already a party to the hearing. The Council may adopt, modify, or reverse the decision or dismissal, may remand the case to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator for further proceedings or may dismiss a hearing request. The Council must issue its action no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the CMS referral, unless the 90 calendar day period has been extended as provided in this subpart. The Council may not, however, issue its action before the 20 calendar day comment period has expired, unless it determines that the agency's referral does not provide a basis for reviewing the case. If the Council does not act within the applicable adjudication deadline, the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision or dismissal is binding on the parties to the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's action.
