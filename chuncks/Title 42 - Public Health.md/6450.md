####### Board denies EJR.

(3)If the Board's decision denies EJR because the Board finds that it has the authority to decide the legal question relevant to the matter at issue, the Administrator may not review the Board's authority determination, and the provider has no right to obtain EJR. If the Board denies EJR based on a finding that it lacks jurisdiction over the specific matter, the provider has no right to obtain EJR unless-

(i) The Administrator renders timely a final decision reversing the Board, finding the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue, and remanding to the Board; or

(ii) A court reverses the Board's or Administrator's decision as to jurisdiction, the Administrator remands to the Board, and the Board subsequently issues on remand from the Administrator an EJR decision granting EJR on the basis that it lacks the authority to decide the legal question.
