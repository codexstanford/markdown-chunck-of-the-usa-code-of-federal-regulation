####### No double payments.

(2)Payments to a group practice under this paragraph must be in lieu of the payments that would otherwise be made under the Electronic Prescribing Incentive Program to eligible professionals in the group practice for being a successful electronic prescriber.

(i) If an eligible professional, as identified by an individual NPI, has reassigned his or her Medicare billing rights to a TIN selected to participate in the electronic prescribing group practice reporting option for a program year, then for that program year the eligible professional must participate in the Electronic Prescribing Incentive Program via the group practice reporting option. For any program year in which the TIN is selected to participate in the Electronic Prescribing Incentive Program group practice reporting option, the eligible professional cannot individually qualify for an electronic prescribing incentive payment by meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(ii) If, for the program year, the eligible professional participates in the Electronic Prescribing Incentive Program under a TIN that is not selected to participate in the Electronic Prescribing Incentive Program group practice reporting option for that program year, then the eligible professional may individually qualify for an electronic prescribing incentive by meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section under that TIN.
