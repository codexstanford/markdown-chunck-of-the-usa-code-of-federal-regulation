###### ยง 423.2122 What evidence may be submitted to the Council.
####### Subpoenas.

(b)When it is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, the Council may, on its own initiative, issue subpoenas requiring an enrollee or Part D plan sponsor to make books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to an issue at the hearing available for inspection and copying. The Council may not issue a subpoena to CMS, or the IRE to compel the production of evidence.

(1) To the extent a subpoena compels disclosure of a matter for which an objection based on privilege, or other protection from disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality or undue burden, was made before the Council, the Secretary may review immediately that subpoena or a portion of the subpoena.

(2) Upon notice to the Council that an enrollee or Part D plan sponsor intends to seek the Secretary review of the subpoena, the Council must stay all proceedings affected by the subpoena, tolling the time period for the Council to issue a final action or remand a case in response to a request for review for 15 calendar days or until the Secretary makes a decision with respect to the review request, whichever occurs first.

(3) If the Secretary does not grant review within the time allotted for the stay, the stay is lifted and the subpoena stands.
