###### ยง 488.56 Temporary waivers applicable to skilled nursing facilities.
####### Waiver of medical director requirement.

(b)To the extent that ยง 483.70(h) of this chapter requires any skilled nursing facility to engage the services of a medical director either part-time or full-time, the Secretary may waive such requirement for such periods as he deems appropriate if, based upon documented findings of the State agency, he determines that:

(1) Such facility is located in an area where the supply of physicians is not sufficient to permit compliance with this requirement without seriously reducing the availability of physician services within the area, and

(2) Such facility has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with ยง 483.70(h) of this chapter, but such compliance is impeded by the unavailability of physicians in the area.
