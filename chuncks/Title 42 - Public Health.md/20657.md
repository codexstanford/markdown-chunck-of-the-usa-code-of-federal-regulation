####### Network and coverage requirements.

(b)All contracts between a State and a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, and PCCM entity, to the extent that the PCCM entity has a provider network, which enroll Indians must:

(1) Require the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to demonstrate that there are sufficient IHCPs participating in the provider network of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to ensure timely access to services available under the contract from such providers for Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services.

(2) Require that IHCPs, whether participating or not, be paid for covered services provided to Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers as follows:

(i) At a rate negotiated between the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity, and the IHCP, or

(ii) In the absence of a negotiated rate, at a rate not less than the level and amount of payment that the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would make for the services to a participating provider which is not an IHCP; and

(iii) Make payment to all IHCPs in its network in a timely manner as required for payments to practitioners in individual or group practices under 42 CFR 447.45 and 447.46.

(3) Permit any Indian who is enrolled in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity that is not an IMCE and eligible to receive services from a IHCP primary care provider participating as a network provider, to choose that IHCP as his or her primary care provider, as long as that provider has capacity to provide the services.

(4) Permit Indian enrollees to obtain services covered under the contract between the State and the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity from out-of-network IHCPs from whom the enrollee is otherwise eligible to receive such services.

(5) In a State where timely access to covered services cannot be ensured due to few or no IHCPs, an MCO, PIHP, PAHP and PCCM entity will be considered to have met the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if-

(i) Indian enrollees are permitted by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to access out-of-State IHCPs; or

(ii) If this circumstance is deemed to be good cause for disenrollment from both the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity and the State's managed care program in accordance with ยง 438.56(c).

(6) MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, and PCCM entities, to the extent the PCCM entity has a provider network, must permit an out-of-network IHCP to refer an Indian enrollee to a network provider.
