(2)In order for a hospital to qualify for an increase in its hospital-specific rate, it must meet the following criteria:

(i) The hospital must submit its request to its intermediary no later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's notice of program reimbursement.

(ii) The request must include documentation specifically identifying the increased costs resulting from the hospital's participation in a rural health network and show that the increased costs during the cost reporting period will result in increased costs in subsequent cost reporting periods that are not already accounted for under the prospective payment system payment.

(iii) The hospital must show that the cost increases are incremental costs that would not have been incurred in the absence of the hospital's membership in a rural health network.

(iv) The hospital must show that the cost increases do not include amounts for start-up and one-time, nonrecurring costs attributable to its membership in a rural health network.
