####### Children eligible for certain State health benefits coverage.

(1)(i) A targeted low-income child may not be eligible for health benefits coverage under a State health benefits plan in the State on the basis of a family member's employment with a public agency, even if the family declines to accept the coverage.

(ii) A child is considered eligible for health benefits coverage under a State health benefits plan if a more than nominal contribution to the cost of health benefits coverage under a State health benefits plan is available from the State or public agency with respect to the child or would have been available from those sources on November 8, 1999. A contribution is considered more than nominal if the State or public agency makes a contribution toward the cost of an employee's dependent(s) that is $10 per family, per month, more than the State or public agency's contribution toward the cost of covering the employee only.
