###### May the sanctuary agree to accept chimpanzees that are not owned by the Federal Government?

(c)The sanctuary may accept chimpanzees that are not owned by the Federal Government subject to the following conditions:

(1) Ownership of the chimpanzee must be transferred to the sanctuary;

(2) Fees for these chimpanzees may be levied based on a range of considerations that include most importantly, the well-being of the chimpanzee and, secondarily, factors that include (but are not limited to) the resources available to support the chimpanzee; the health, age, and social history of the chimpanzee; and other relevant factors affecting the cost of caring for the chimpanzee. While chimpanzees not owned or supported by the Federal Government may be admitted to the sanctuary, federal funds may not be used for their support unless authorized by the Secretary or an authorized designee;

(3) Available space exists in the sanctuary; and

(4) An agreement exists between the sanctuary system and the ORIP/DPCPSI/NIH documenting that the chimpanzee may be brought into the sanctuary.
