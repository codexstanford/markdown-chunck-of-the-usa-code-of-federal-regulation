(3)(i) Full benefit dual eligible individuals who are qualifying covered retirees as defined in ยง 423.882 of this part, and for whom CMS has approved the group health plan sponsor to receive the retirement drug subsidy described in subpart R of this part, also are automatically enrolled in a Part D plan, consistent with this paragraph, unless they elect to decline that enrollment.

(ii) Before effectuating such an enrollment, CMS provides notice to such individuals of their choices and advises them to discuss the potential impact of Medicare Part D coverage on their group health plan coverage. The notice informs individuals that they will be deemed to have declined to enroll in Part D unless they affirmatively enroll in a Part D plan or contact CMS and confirm that they wish to be auto-enrolled in a PDP. Individuals who elect not to be auto-enrolled, may enroll in Medicare Part D at a later time if they choose to do so.

(iii) All other low income subsidy eligible beneficiaries who are qualified covered retirees are not enrolled by CMS into PDPs.
