####### Interfacility transfers

(4)-(i) An interfacility transfer occurs when an individual is transferred from one NF to another NF, with or without an intervening hospital stay. Interfacility transfers are subject to annual resident review rather than preadmission screening.

(ii) In cases of transfer of a resident with MI or IID from a NF to a hospital or to another NF, the transferring NF is responsible for ensuring that copies of the resident's most recent PASARR and resident assessment reports accompany the transferring resident.
