###### ยง 438.910 Parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations.
####### Sub-classifications permitted for office visits, separate from other outpatient services.

(ii)For purposes of applying the financial requirement and treatment limitation rules of this section, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may divide its benefits furnished on an outpatient basis into the two sub-classifications described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). After the sub-classifications are established, the MCO, PIHP or PAHP may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Sub-classifications other than these special rules, such as separate sub-classifications for generalists and specialists, are not permitted. The two sub-classifications permitted under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are:

(A) Office visits (such as physician visits); and

(B) All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges, or other medical items).
