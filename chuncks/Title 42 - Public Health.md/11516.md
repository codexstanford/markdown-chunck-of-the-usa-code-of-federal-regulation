####### 1,10-day notification:

()Ten business days prior to picking up the item, the supplier should have direct contact (for example, a phone call) with the beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver and receive acknowledgement that the beneficiary understands their equipment will be picked up. This should occur on the first anniversary date after the start of the CBP or on another date agreed to by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver. The beneficiary's anniversary date occurs every month and is the date of the month on which the item was first delivered to the beneficiary by the current supplier. When a date other than the anniversary date is chosen by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver, the noncontract supplier will still receive payment up to the anniversary date after the start of the CBP, and the new contract supplier may not bill for any period of time before the anniversary date.
