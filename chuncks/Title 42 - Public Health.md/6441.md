(2)A provider or group of providers may request the Board to grant EJR of a specific matter or matters under appeal, or the Board on its own motion may consider whether to grant EJR of a specific matter or matters under appeal. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the Board may initiate own motion consideration of its authority to decide a legal question only if the Board makes a preliminary finding that it has jurisdiction over the specific matter at issue to which the legal question is relevant. Under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a provider may request a determination of the Board's authority to decide a legal question, but the 30-day period for the Board to make a determination under section 1878(f)(1) of the Act does not begin to run until the Board finds jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on the specific matter at issue in the EJR request and notifies the provider that the provider's request is complete.
