####### Institutionalized-equivalent

means for the purpose of defining a special needs individual, an MA eligible individual who is living in the community but requires an institutional level of care. The determination that the individual requires an institutional level of care (LOC) must be made by-

(1) The use of a State assessment tool from the State in which the individual resides; and

(2) An assessment conducted by an impartial entity and having the requisite knowledge and experience to accurately identify whether the beneficiary meets the institutional LOC criteria. In States and territories that do not have an existing institutional level of care assessment tool, the individual must be assessed using the same methodology that State uses to determine institutional level of care for Medicaid nursing home eligibility.
