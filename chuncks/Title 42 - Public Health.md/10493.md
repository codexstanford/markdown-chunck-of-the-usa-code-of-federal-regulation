####### Change in method.

(2)Prior to August 1, 1970, a provider may change from the straight-line method to an accelerated method or vice versa, upon advance approval from the contractor on a prospective basis with the request being made before the end of the first month of the prospective reporting period. Only one such change with respect to a particular asset may be made by a provider. Effective with August 1, 1970, a provider may only change from an accelerated method or optional method (see ยง 413.139) to the straight-line method. Such a change may be made without contractor approval and the basis for depreciation is the undepreciated cost reduced by the salvage value. Thereafter, once straight-line depreciation is selected for a particular asset, an accelerated method may not be established for that asset.
