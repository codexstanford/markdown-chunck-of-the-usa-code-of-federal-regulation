(i) Payment rates that are not less than the rates that apply under original Medicare for the provider in question;

(ii) Subject to paragraph (A) of section (a)(2)(ii), contracts or agreements with a sufficient number and range of providers to furnish the services covered under the MA private fee-for-service plan; or

(B) [Reserved]

(iii) A combination of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

(3) For plan year 2011 and subsequent plan years, an MA organization that offers an MA private fee-for-service plan (other than a plan described in section 1857(i)(1) or (2) of the Act) that is operating in a network area (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section) meets the requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the MA organization has contracts or agreements with providers in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
