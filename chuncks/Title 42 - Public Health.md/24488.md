### Subchapter G - Standards and Certification
#### PART 485 - CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION: SPECIALIZED PROVIDERS
##### Subpart F - Conditions of Participation: Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)
###### § 485.610 Condition of participation: Status and location.
####### Standard: Off-campus and co-location requirements for CAHs.

(e)A CAH may continue to meet the location requirements of paragraph (c) of this section only if the CAH meets the following:

(1) If a CAH with a necessary provider designation is co-located (that is, it shares a campus, as defined in § 413.65(a)(2) of this chapter, with another hospital or CAH), the necessary provider CAH can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section only if the co-location arrangement was in effect before January 1, 2008, and the type and scope of services offered by the facility co-located with the necessary provider CAH do not change. A change of ownership of any of the facilities with a co-location arrangement that was in effect before January 1, 2008, will not be considered to be a new co-location arrangement.

(2) If a CAH or a necessary provider CAH operates an off-campus provider-based location, excluding an RHC as defined in § 405.2401(b) of this chapter, but including a department or remote location, as defined in § 413.65(a)(2) of this chapter, or an off-campus distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit, as defined in § 485.647, that was created or acquired by the CAH on or after January 1, 2008, the CAH can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section only if the off-campus provider-based location or off-campus distinct part unit is located more than a 35-mile drive on primary roads, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (or, in the case of mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads available, a 15-mile drive) from a hospital or another CAH.

(3) If either a CAH or a CAH that has been designated as a necessary provider by the State does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, by co-locating with another hospital or CAH on or after January 1, 2008, or creates or acquires an off-campus provider-based location or off-campus distinct part unit on or after January 1, 2008, that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the CAH's provider agreement will be subject to termination in accordance with the provisions of § 489.53(a)(3) of this subchapter, unless the CAH terminates the off-campus arrangement or the co-location arrangement, or both.
