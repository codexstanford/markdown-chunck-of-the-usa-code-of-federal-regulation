(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, CMS establishes reasonable compensation equivalency limits on the amount of compensation paid to physicians by providers. These limits are applied to a provider's costs incurred in compensating physicians for services to the provider, as described in § 415.55(a).

(2) Limits established under this section do not apply to costs of physician compensation attributable to furnishing inpatient hospital services that are paid for under the prospective payment system implemented under part 412 of this chapter or to costs of physician compensation attributable to approved GME programs that are payable under §§ 413.75 through 413.83 of this chapter.

(3) Compensation that a physician receives for activities that may not be paid for under either Part A or Part B of Medicare is not considered in applying these limits.
