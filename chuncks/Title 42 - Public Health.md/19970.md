####### ยง 435.121 Individuals in States using more restrictive requirements for Medicaid than the SSI requirements.
######## Nonfinancial conditions.

(d)The agency may apply more restrictive requirements that are nonfinancial conditions of eligibility. For example, the agency may use a more restrictive definition of disability or may limit eligibility of the disabled to individuals age 18 and older, or both. If the agency limits eligibility of disabled individuals to individuals age 18 or older, it must provide Medicaid to individuals under age 18 who receive SSI benefits and who would be eligible to receive AFDC under the State's approved plan if they did not receive SSI. If the agency imposed an age limit for disabled individuals under its 1972 approved State plan but does not use that limit, it must apply the same nonfinancial requirement to individuals under age 18 that it applies to disabled individuals age 18 and older.
