######## Payment rate for RHCs that are authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system.

(a)

(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, an RHC that is authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system is paid an all-inclusive rate that is determined by the MAC at the beginning of the cost reporting period.

(2) The rate is determined by dividing the estimated total allowable costs by estimated total visits for RHC services.

(3) The rate determination is subject to any tests of reasonableness that may be established in accordance with this subpart.

(4) The MAC, during each reporting period, periodically reviews the rate to assure that payments approximate actual allowable costs and visits and adjusts the rate if:

(i) There is a significant change in the utilization of services;

(ii) Actual allowable costs vary materially from allowable costs; or

(iii) Other circumstances arise which warrant an adjustment.

(5) The RHC may request the MAC to review the rate to determine whether adjustment is required.
