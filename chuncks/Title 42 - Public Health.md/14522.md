####### Plan benefit packages.

(2)All plan benefit packages (PBPs) offered under an MA contract have the same overall and/or summary Star Ratings as the contract under which the PBP is offered by the MA organization. Data from all the PBPs offered under a contract are used to calculate the measure and domain ratings for the contract except for Special Needs Plan (SNP)-specific measures collected at the PBP level; a contract level score for such measures is calculated using an enrollment-weighted mean of the PBP scores and enrollment reported as part of the measure specification in each PBP.
