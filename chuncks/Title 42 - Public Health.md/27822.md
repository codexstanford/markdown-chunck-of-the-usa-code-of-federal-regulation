###### ยง 510.300 Determination of episode quality-adjusted target prices.
####### Episode quality-adjusted target price.

(b)(1) CMS calculates quality-adjusted target prices based on a blend of each participant hospital's hospital-specific and regional episode expenditures. The region corresponds to the U.S. Census Division associated with the primary address of the CCN of the participant hospital and the regional component is based on all hospitals in said region, except as follows. In cases where an MSA selected for participation in CJR spans more than one U.S. Census Division, the entire MSA will be grouped into the U.S. Census Division where the largest city by population in the MSA is located for quality-adjusted target price and reconciliation calculations. The calendar years used for historical expenditure calculations are as follows:

(i) Episodes beginning in 2012 through 2014 for performance years 1 and 2.

(ii) Episodes beginning in 2014 through 2016 for performance years 3 and 4.

(iii) Episodes beginning in 2016 through 2018 for each of performance year subsets 5.1 and 5.2.

(iv) Episodes beginning in 2019 for performance year 6.

(v) Episodes beginning in 2021 for performance year 7.

(vi) Episodes beginning in 2022 for performance year 8.

(2) Specifically, the blend consists of the following:

(i) Two-thirds of the participant hospital's own historical episode payments and one-third of the regional historical episode payments for performance years 1 and 2.

(ii) One-third of the hospital's own historical episode payments and two-thirds of the regional historical episode payments for performance year 3.

(iii) Regional historical episode payments for performance year 4, for each subset of performance year 5, and performance years 6 through 8.
