####### General rule.

(a)If an MA organization contracts with an employer, labor organization, or the trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations that cover enrollees in an MA plan, or contracts with a State Medicaid agency to provide Medicaid benefits to individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and who are enrolled in an MA plan, the enrollees must be provided the same benefits as all other enrollees in the MA plan, with the employer, labor organization, fund trustees, or Medicaid benefits supplementing the MA plan benefits. Jurisdiction regulating benefits under these circumstances is as follows:

(1) All requirements of this part that apply to the MA program apply to the MA plan coverage and benefits provided to enrollees eligible for benefits under an employer, labor organization, trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations, or Medicaid contract.

(2) Employer benefits that complement an MA plan, which are not part of the MA plan, are not subject to review or approval by CMS.

(3) Medicaid benefits are not reviewed under this part, but are subject to appropriate CMS review under the Medicaid program. MA plan benefits provided to individuals entitled to Medicaid benefits provided by the MA organization under a contract with the State Medicaid agency are subject to MA rules and requirements.
