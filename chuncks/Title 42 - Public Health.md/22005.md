A State Medicaid agency must screen all initial applications, including applications for a new practice location, and any applications received in response to a re-enrollment or revalidation of enrollment request based on a categorical risk level of "limited," "moderate," or "high." If a provider could fit within more than one risk level described in this section, the highest level of screening is applicable.
