####### Guarantees and projected losses.

(e)Guarantees will be an acceptable resource to fund projected losses, provided that a PSO-

(1) Meets CMS's requirements for guarantors and guarantee documents as specified in ยง 422.390; and

(2) Obtains from the guarantor cash or cash equivalents to fund the projected losses timely, as follows-

(i) Prior to the effective date of a PSO's MA contract, the amount of the projected losses for the first two quarters;

(ii) During the first quarter and prior to the beginning of the second quarter of a PSO's MA contract, the amount of projected losses through the end of the third quarter; and

(iii) During the second quarter and prior to the beginning of the third quarter of a PSO's MA contract, the amount of projected losses through the end of the fourth quarter.

(3) If the guarantor complies with the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the PSO, in the third quarter, may notify CMS of its intent to reduce the period of advance funding of projected losses. CMS will notify the PSO within 60 days of receiving the PSO's request if the requested reduction in the period of advance funding will not be accepted.

(4) If the guarantee requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section are not met, CMS may take appropriate action, such as requiring funding of projected losses through means other than a guarantee. CMS retains discretion to require other methods or timing of funding, considering factors such as the financial condition of the guarantor and the accuracy of the financial plan.
