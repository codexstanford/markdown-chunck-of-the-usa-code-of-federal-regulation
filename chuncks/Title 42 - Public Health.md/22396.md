(2)At the end of each calendar quarter, the State agency must identify those checks that remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 days after issuance. The CHIP agency must refund all FFP that it received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the Act and the regulations issued in accordance with the Act.

(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.
