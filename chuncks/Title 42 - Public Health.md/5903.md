####### When comparability exists.

(b)"Comparable circumstances," as used in the Act and this subpart, refers to the circumstances under which services are rendered to individuals and the nature of the carrier's health insurance programs and the method it uses to determine the amounts of payments under these programs. Generally, comparability would exist where:

(1) The carrier bases payment under its program on the customary charges, as presently constituted, of physicians or other persons and on current prevailing charges in a locality, and

(2) The determination does not preclude recognition of factors such as speciality status and unusual circumstances which affect the amount charged for a service.
