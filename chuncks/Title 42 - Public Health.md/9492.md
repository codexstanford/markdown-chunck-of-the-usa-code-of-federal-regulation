(1) Payment for the operating and capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services for each patient, including outlier payments as provided in ยง 412.525 and payments for hemophilia clotting factor costs as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, are made to the entity that is the legal owner on the date of discharge. Payments are not prorated between the buyer and seller.

(ii) Each bill submitted must include all information necessary for the intermediary to compute the payment amount, whether or not some of that information is attributable to a period during which a different party legally owned the hospital.

(2) Other payments for the direct costs of approved medical education programs, bad debts, anesthesia services furnished by hospital employed nonphysician anesthetists, and costs of photocopying and mailing medical records to the QIO as provided for under paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of this section are made to each owner or operator of the hospital (buyer and seller) in accordance with the principles of reasonable cost reimbursement.
