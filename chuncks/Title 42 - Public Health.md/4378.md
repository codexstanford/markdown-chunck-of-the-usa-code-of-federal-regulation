####### Deficits.

(d)(1) Where a Title VI-assisted facility has been assessed as having a deficit under § 124.503(b) that has not been made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make up the deficit by providing uncompensated services in accordance with this section. The facility shall receive credit towards its deficit on the basis of one year, or part thereof, of credit towards each "deficit year" for each year, or part thereof, of operation in compliance with this section and the applicable requirements of this subpart.

(2) The number of "deficit years" of a facility shall be calculated as follows:

(i) Determine the number of years in the facility's total period of obligation pursuant to § 124.501;

(ii) Subtract the number of years in which the facility operated in compliance with this section and the applicable requirements of this subpart from the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;

(iii) For all years in which the facility did not operate in compliance with this section, determine the ratio of the total compliance levels applicable under § 124.503(a) to the facility's total deficit under § 124.503(b);

(iv) Multiply the percentage derived under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section by the number of years under obligation pursuant to § 124.501 but for which the facility did not operate in compliance with this section;

(v) Subtract the number derived under paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section from the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;

(vi) If the facility is still within the period described in § 124.501(b)(1), add the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section to the end of the period of obligation, or if the facility is beyond the period described in § 124.501(b)(1), add the number of years derived under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section to the last year the facility operated in compliance with this section.
