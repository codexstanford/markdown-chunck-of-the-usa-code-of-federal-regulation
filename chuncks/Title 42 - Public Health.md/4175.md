####### Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN).

(4)SJS/TEN is a spectrum of acute hypersensitivity reactions that affects skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes, internal organs (systemic toxicity) associated with the use or administration of replication- competent smallpox vaccines. For purposes of Table 2, both skin and mucous membrane rash or lesions must be present. Rash or lesion distribution must be widespread. Rash must not have a symmetric acral distribution (affecting arms, hands, legs or feet). Two or more mucosal sites must be involved. Mucosal lesions generally manifest as painful lesions in sites, such as the mouth or eyes. Skin rash or lesions in SJS/TEN usually consist of red or purple raised areas (erythematous macules), blisters, and ulcerations.
