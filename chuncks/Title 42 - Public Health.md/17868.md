(c)(1) An OTP may only be enrolled as an OTP via the Form CMS-855A or Form CMS-855B but not both.

(2) If a currently enrolled OTP is changing its OTP enrollment from a Form CMS-855B enrollment to a Form CMS-855A enrollment, or vice versa, the effective date of billing that was established for the OTP's prior enrollment under §§ 424.520(d) and 424.521(a) is applied to the OTP's new enrollment.
