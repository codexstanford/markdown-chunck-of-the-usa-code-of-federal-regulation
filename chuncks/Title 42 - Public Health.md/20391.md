####### Individuals under age 21.

(g)(1) For any individual who is emancipated from his or her parents or who is married and capable of indicating intent, the State of residence is the State where the individual is living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.

(2) For any individual not residing in an institution as defined in paragraph (b) whose Medicaid eligibility is based on blindness or disability, the State of residence is the State in which the individual is living.

(3) For any other non-institutionalized individual not subject to paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, the State of residence is determined in accordance with 45 CFR 233.40, the rules governing residence under the AFDC program.

(4) For any institutionalized individual who is neither married nor emancipated, the State of residence is-

(i) The parents' or legal guardian's current State of residence at the time of placement; or

(ii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian who files the application, if the individual is institutionalized in that State. If a legal guardian has been appointed and the parental rights are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead of the parent's.

(iii) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in that State.
