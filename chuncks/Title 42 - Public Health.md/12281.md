(b)With the exception of data that must be mandatorily reported on Physician Compare, for each program year, CMS relies on established public reporting standards to guide the information available for inclusion on Physician Compare. The public reporting standards require data included on Physician Compare to be statistically valid, reliable, and accurate; comparable across collection types; and meet the reliability threshold. And, to be included on the public facing profile pages, the data must also resonate with website users, as determined by CMS.
