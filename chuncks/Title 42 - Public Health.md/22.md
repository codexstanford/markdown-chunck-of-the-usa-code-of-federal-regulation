##### Subpart B - General Provisions
###### ยง 2.11 Definitions.
####### Records,e.g.,

means any information, whether recorded or not, created by, received, or acquired by a part 2 program relating to a patient (diagnosis, treatment and referral for treatment information, billing information, emails, voice mails, and texts), provided, however, that information conveyed orally by a part 2 program to a non-part 2 provider for treatment purposes with the consent of the patient does not become a record subject to this Part in the possession of the non-part 2 provider merely because that information is reduced to writing by that non-part 2 provider. Records otherwise transmitted by a part 2 program to a non-part 2 provider retain their characteristic as records in the hands of the non-part 2 provider, but may be segregated by that provider. For the purpose of the regulations in this part, records include both paper and electronic records.
