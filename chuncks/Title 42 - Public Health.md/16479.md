####### Payments.

(2)CMS at its discretion either makes lump-sum payments or adjusts monthly payments throughout the remainder of the payment year following the coverage year based on the difference between interim low-income cost-sharing subsidy payments and total low-income cost-sharing subsidy costs eligible for subsidy under ยง 423.782 submitted by the plan for the coverage year. CMS may recover payments made through a lump sum recovery or by adjusting monthly payments throughout the remainder of the coverage year if interim low-income cost-sharing subsidy payments exceed the amount payable under ยง 423.782 or if the Part D sponsor does not provide the data in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In the event adequate data is not provided for risk corridor costs, CMS assumes that the Part D plan's adjusted allowable risk corridor costs are 50 percent of the target amount.
