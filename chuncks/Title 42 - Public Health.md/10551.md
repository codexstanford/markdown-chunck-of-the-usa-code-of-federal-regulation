####### Corrections to depreciation.

(d)If the asset is disposed of before the expiration of its estimated useful life, the depreciation would be adjusted to the actual useful life. Likewise, a provider may not have fully depreciated other assets it is using and finds that it has incorrectly estimated the useful lives of those assets. In such cases, the provider may use the corrected useful lives in determining the amount of depreciation, provided such corrections have been approved by the contractor.
