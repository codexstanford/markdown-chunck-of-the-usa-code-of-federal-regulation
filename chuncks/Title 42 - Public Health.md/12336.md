####### Exception to application of MIPS payment adjustment factors to model-specific payments under section 1115A APMs.

(f)Beginning with the 2019 MIPS payment year, the payment adjustment factors specified under paragraph (e) of this section are not applicable to payments that meet all of the following conditions:

(1) Are made only to participants in a model tested under section 1115A of the Act;

(2) Would otherwise be subject to the requirement to apply the MIPS payment adjustment factors if the payment is made with respect to a MIPS eligible clinician participating in a section 1115A model; and

(3) Either have a specified payment amount or are paid according to a methodology for calculating a model-specific payment that is applied in a consistent manner to all model participants, such that application of the MIPS payment adjustment factors would potentially interfere with CMS's ability to effectively evaluate the impact of the APM.
