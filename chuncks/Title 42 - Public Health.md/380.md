#### PART 5 - DESIGNATION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONAL(S) SHORTAGE AREAS
##### Appendix A to Part 5 - Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages of Primary Medical Care Professional(s)
###### Criteria.

1.

Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having a shortage of primary medical care professional(s) if both the following criteria are met:

(a) The institution has at least 250 inmates.

(b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of FTE primary care physicians serving the institution is at least 1,000:1.

Here the number of internees is defined as follows:

(i) If the number of new inmates per year and the average length-of-stay are not specified, or if the information provided does not indicate that intake medical examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates.

(ii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as one year or more, and intake medical examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates + (0.3) x number of new inmates per year.

(iii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as less than one year, and intake examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates + (0.2) x (1 + ALOS/2) x number of new inmates per year where ALOS = average length-of-stay (in fraction of year). (The number of FTE primary care physicians is computed as in part I, section B, paragraph 3 above.)

2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.

Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups based on the number of inmates and/or the ratio (R) of internees to primary care physicians, as follows:

Group 1-Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no physicians.

Group 2-Other institutions with no physicians and institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 2,000:1.

Group 3-Institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 1,000:1 but less than 2,000:1.
