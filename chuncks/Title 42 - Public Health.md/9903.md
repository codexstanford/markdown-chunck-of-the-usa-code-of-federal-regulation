###### § 413.40 Ceiling on the rate of increase in hospital inpatient costs.
####### Cost reporting periods subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling,Base period.

(b)-(1)Each hospital's target amount is based on its allowable net inpatient operating costs per case from the cost reporting period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the first cost reporting period subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling established under this section. If the immediately preceding cost reporting period is a short reporting period (fewer than 12 months), the first period of at least 12 months subsequent to that short period is the base period.

(i) The target amount established under this provision remains applicable to a hospital or excluded hospital unit, as described in §§ 412.25 through 412.30 of this chapter, despite intervening cost reporting periods during which the hospital or excluded hospital unit is not subject to the ceiling as a result of other provisions of the law or regulations, or nonparticipation in the Medicare program, unless the hospital or excluded hospital unit qualifies as a new hospital or excluded part hospital unit under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

(ii) The base period for a newly established excluded unit is the first cost reporting period of at least 12 months following the unit's certification to participate in the Medicare program.

(iii) When the operational structure of a hospital or unit changes (that is, a freestanding hospital becomes an excluded unit or an excluded unit becomes a freestanding hospital, or an entity of a multicampus hospital becomes a newly created hospital or unit or a hospital or unit becomes a part of a multicampus hospital), the base period for the hospital or unit that changed its operational structure is the first cost reporting period of at least 12 months effective with the revised Medicare certification classification.
