###### § 413.70 Payment for services of a CAH.
####### 2,For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2010.

()If a CAH had elected the method specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in its most recent cost reporting period beginning prior to October 1, 2010, that election remains in effect for all of that period and for all subsequent cost reporting periods, unless the CAH submits a termination request to the contractor or MAC servicing the CAH at least 30 days before the start of the next cost reporting period. However, for cost reporting periods beginning in October 2010 and November 2010, if a CAH wishes to terminate its previous election, the CAH must submit a termination request to the contractor or MAC servicing the CAH prior to December 1, 2010. If a CAH had no election in effect in its most recent preceding cost reporting period and chooses to elect the method specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section on or after October 1, 2010, the election must be made in writing and delivered to the contractor or MAC servicing the CAH at least 30 days before the start of the first cost reporting period for which the election is made. Once the election is made, it remains in effect for all of that period and for all subsequent cost reporting periods unless the CAH submits a termination request to the contractor or MAC servicing the CAH at least 30 days before the start of the next cost reporting period.

(B) An election of the payment method specified under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section applies to all services furnished to outpatients by a physician or other practitioner who has reassigned his or her rights to bill for those services to the CAH in accordance with subpart F of part 424 of this chapter. If a physician or other practitioner does not reassign his or her billing rights to the CAH in accordance with subpart F of part 424 of this chapter, payment for the physician's or practitioner's services furnished to CAH outpatients will be made on a fee schedule or other applicable basis as specified in subpart B of part 414 of this subchapter.

(C) In the case of a CAH that made an election under this section before November 1, 2003, for a cost reporting period beginning before December 1, 2003, the rules in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section are applicable to cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2001.

(D) An election made under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is effective as provided for under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) or paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section and does not apply to an election that was terminated prior to the start of the cost reporting period for which it would otherwise apply.

(ii) If the CAH elects payment under this method, payment to the CAH for each outpatient visit will be the sum of the following:

(A) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2004, for facility services not including any services for which payment may be made under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, 101 percent of the reasonable costs of the services as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

(B) For professional services that are furnished by a physician or other practitioner who has reassigned his or her rights to bill for those services to the CAH in accordance with part 424, subpart F of this chapter, and that would otherwise be payable to the physician or other practitioner if the rights to bill for them had not been reassigned, 115 percent of the amounts that otherwise would be paid for the service if the CAH had not elected payment under this method. Effective for primary care services furnished by primary care practitioners (as defined in § 414.80(a)) and major surgical procedures furnished by general surgeons in health professional shortage areas (as defined in § 414.2) furnished on or after January 1, 2011 and before January 1, 2016, incentive payments specified under § 414.80 and § 414.67(b), respectively, of this title must not be included in determining payment made under this paragraph.

(iii) Payment to a CAH, other than for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, is subject to the Part B deductible and coinsurance amounts, as determined under §§ 410.152(k), 410.160, and 410.161 of this chapter.
