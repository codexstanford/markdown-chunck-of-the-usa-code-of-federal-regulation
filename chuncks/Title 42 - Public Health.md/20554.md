####### Requirements for MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs responsible for coordinating benefits for dually eligible individuals.

(t)In a State that enters into a Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) with Medicare for Medicaid, an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP contract that includes responsibility for coordination of benefits for individuals dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare must specify the methodology by which the State ensures that the appropriate MCO, PIHP, or PAHP receives all applicable crossover claims for which the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is responsible. If the State elects to use a methodology other than requiring the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to enter into a COBA with Medicare, that methodology must ensure that the submitting provider is promptly informed on the State's remittance advice that the State has not denied payment and that the claim has been sent to the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for payment consideration.
