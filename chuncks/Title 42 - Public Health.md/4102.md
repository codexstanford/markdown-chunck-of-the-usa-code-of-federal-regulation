###### ยง 110.46 Amending a Request Package.
####### Requests in which the benefits are sought for the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient.

(c)If an injured countermeasure recipient submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but subsequently dies before all due benefits are paid by the Program, the executor or administrator of his or her estate may amend his or her Request Package at any time in order for the estate to be considered for benefits. This opportunity to amend applies also if the Request Form was timely filed by a survivor. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's Request Package. However, the executor or administrator of the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's estate filing an amendment to a previously filed Request Package may only be eligible to receive benefits on behalf of the estate if the previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing deadline. All documentation that has already been submitted with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient will be considered part of that person's Request Package, and the executor or administrator of the estate is not required to resubmit such documentation.
