(c)(1) "Statewide operation" does not mean, for example, that every source of service must furnish the service State-wide. The requirement does not preclude the agency from contracting with a comprehensive health care organization (such as an HMO or a rural health clinic) that serves a specific area of the State, to furnish services to Medicaid beneficiaries who live in that area and chose to receive services from that HMO or rural health clinic. beneficiaries who live in other parts of the State may receive their services from other sources.

(2) Other allowable exceptions and waivers are set forth in §§ 431.54 and 431.55.
