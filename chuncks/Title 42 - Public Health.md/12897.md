####### Examples of acceptable employer contributions.

(3)The following are methods that are considered nondiscriminatory:

(i) The employer contribution to the HMO is the same, per employee, as the contribution to non-HMO alternatives.

(ii) The employer contribution reflects the composition of the HMO's enrollment in terms of enrollee attributes that can reasonably be used to predict utilization, experience, costs, or risk. For each enrollee in a given class established on the basis of those attributes, the employer contributes an equal amount, regardless of the health benefits plan chosen by the employee.

(iii) The employer contribution is a fixed percentage of the premium for each of the alternatives offered.

(iv) The employer contribution is determined under a mutually acceptable arrangement negotiated by the HMO and the employer. In negotiating the arrangement, the employer may not insist on terms that would cause the HMO to violate any of the requirements of this part.
