(1) Applications for facility approval must include a comprehensive assessment by a qualified medical physicist within 12 months prior to application addressing the performance of X-ray generators, automatic exposure controls, and image capture systems. The assessment must comply with the following guidelines: AAPM Report No. 93, pages 1-68; AAPM Report No. 74, pages 6-11; and AAPM Report No. 14, pages 1-96 (incorporated by reference,ยง 37.10).

(2) Radiographic technique charts must be used that are developed specifically for the radiography system and detector combinations used, indicating exposure parameters by anatomic measurements. If automated exposure control devices are used, calibration for chest imaging must be documented using the actual voltages and image capture systems.
