####### General rule.

(b)All individuals must meet the following conditions:

(1) They are eligible to enroll for SMI on the basis of age or disability, but not on the basis of end-stage renal disease.

(2) When first eligible for SMI coverage (4th month of their initial enrollment period), they were covered under a GHP or LGHP on the basis of current employment status or, if not so covered, they enrolled in SMI during their initial enrollment period; and

(3) For all months thereafter, they maintained coverage under either SMI or a GHP or LGHP. (Generally, if an individual fails to enroll in SMI during any available SEP, he or she is not entitled to any additional SEPs. However, if an individual fails to enroll during a SEP because coverage under the same or a different GHP or LGHP was restored before the end of that particular SEP, that failure to enroll does not preclude additional SEPs.)
