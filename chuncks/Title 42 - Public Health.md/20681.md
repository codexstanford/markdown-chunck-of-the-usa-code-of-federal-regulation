####### Cause for disenrollment.

(2)The following are cause for disenrollment:

(i) The enrollee moves out of the MCO's, PIHP's, PAHP's, PCCM's, or PCCM entity's service area.

(ii) The plan does not, because of moral or religious objections, cover the service the enrollee seeks.

(iii) The enrollee needs related services (for example, a cesarean section and a tubal ligation) to be performed at the same time; not all related services are available within the provider network; and the enrollee's primary care provider or another provider determines that receiving the services separately would subject the enrollee to unnecessary risk.

(iv) For enrollees that use MLTSS, the enrollee would have to change their residential, institutional, or employment supports provider based on that provider's change in status from an in-network to an out-of-network provider with the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP and, as a result, would experience a disruption in their residence or employment.

(v) Other reasons, including poor quality of care, lack of access to services covered under the contract, or lack of access to providers experienced in dealing with the enrollee's care needs.
