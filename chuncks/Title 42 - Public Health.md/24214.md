####### Calculation of the unadjusted national average prospective payment amount for the 60-day episode.

(d)For episodes beginning on or before December 31, 2019, CMS calculates the unadjusted national 60-day episode payment in the following manner:

(1) By computing the mean national cost per visit.

(2) By computing the national mean utilization for each discipline.

(3) By multiplying the mean national cost per visit by the national mean utilization summed in the aggregate for the six disciplines.

(4) By adding to the amount derived in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, amounts for nonroutine medical supplies, an OASIS adjustment for estimated ongoing reporting costs, an OASIS adjustment for the one time implementation costs associated with assessment scheduling form changes and amounts for Part B therapies that could have been unbundled to Part B prior to October 1, 2000. The resulting amount is the unadjusted national 60-day episode rate.
