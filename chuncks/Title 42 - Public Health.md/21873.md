####### Example.

(vi)After adjusting for sales excluded from AMP, the total lagged price concessions over the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales for NDC 12345-6789 subject to the AMP reporting requirement equal $200,000, and the total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement for the same period equals $600,000. The lagged price concessions percentage for this period equals 200,000/600,000 = 0.33333. The total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement for the month being reported equals $50,000 for 10,000 units sold. The manufacturer's AMP calculation for this NDC for this month is: $50,000-(0.33333 x $50,000) = $33,334 (net total sales amount); $33,334/10,000 = $3.33340 (AMP).
