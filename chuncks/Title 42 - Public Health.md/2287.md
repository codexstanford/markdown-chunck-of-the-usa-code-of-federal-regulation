###### ยง 57.3202 How will allowable increases be determined?

(a) The Secretary is responsible for increases in tuition and other educational costs only if the same increase is charged to all students in the same category (for example, the same class year or place of residence) and without regard to whether the student is receiving support under the scholarship programs. A student participating in the scholarship programs may not be denied eligibility because of this participation for any discounts or rebates in tuition or other educational costs given to all other students in the same category at the institution.
