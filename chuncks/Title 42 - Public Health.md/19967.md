####### § 435.121 Individuals in States using more restrictive requirements for Medicaid than the SSI requirements.
######## Basic eligibility group requirements.

(a)(1) If the agency does not provide Medicaid under § 435.120 to aged, blind, and disabled individuals who are SSI beneficiaries, the agency must provide Medicaid to aged, blind, and disabled individuals who meet eligibility requirements that are specified in this section.

(2) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the agency may elect to apply more restrictive eligibility requirements to the aged, blind, and disabled that are more restrictive than those of the SSI program. The more restrictive requirements may be no more restrictive than those requirements contained in the State's Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. If any of the State's 1972 Medicaid plan requirements were more liberal than of the SSI program, the State must use the SSI requirement instead of the more liberal requirements, except to the extent the State elects to use more liberal criteria under § 435.601.

(3) The agency must not apply a more restrictive requirement under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if:

(i) The requirement conflicts with the requirements of section 1924 of the Act, which governs the eligibility and post-eligibility treatment of income and resources of institutionalized individuals with community spouses;

(ii) The requirement conflicts with a more liberal requirement which the agency has elected to use under § 435.601; or

(iii) The more restrictive requirement conflicts with a more liberal requirement the State has elected to use under § 435.234(c) in determining eligibility for State supplementary payments.
