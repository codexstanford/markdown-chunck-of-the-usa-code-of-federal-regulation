###### ยง 411.404 Criteria for determining that a beneficiary knew that services were excluded from coverage as custodial care or as not reasonable and necessary.
####### Written notice.

(b)(1) Written notice is given to the beneficiary, or to someone acting on his or her behalf, that the services were not covered because they did not meet Medicare coverage guidelines.

(2) A notice concerning similar or reasonably comparable services furnished on a previous occasion also meets this criterion.

(3) After a beneficiary is notified that there is no Medicare payment for a service that is not covered by Medicare, he or she is presumed to know that there is no Medicare payment for any form of subsequent treatment for the non-covered condition.
