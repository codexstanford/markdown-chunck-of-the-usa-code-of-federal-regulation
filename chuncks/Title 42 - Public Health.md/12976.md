###### ยง 417.413 Qualifying condition: Operating experience and enrollment.
####### Standard: Open enrollment.

(e)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an HMO or CMP must enroll Medicare beneficiaries on a first-come, first-served basis to the limit of its capacity and provide annual open enrollment periods of at least 30 days duration for Medicare beneficiaries.

(2) CMS may waive the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if compliance would prevent compliance with the limitation on enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid beneficiaries (paragraph (d) of this section) or result in an enrollment substantially nonrepresentative of the population of the HMO's or CMP's geographic area. The enrollment would be "substantially nonrepresentative" if the proportion of a subgroup to the total enrollment exceeded, by 10 percent or more, its proportion of the population in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area, as shown by census data or other data acceptable to CMS. For purposes of this paragraph, a subgroup means a class of Medicare enrollees as defined in ยง 417.582.
