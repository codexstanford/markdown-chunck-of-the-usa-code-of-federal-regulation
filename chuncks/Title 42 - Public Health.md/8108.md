####### Medicare continues to be primary after an aged or disabled beneficiary becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD.,Applicability of the rule.

(4)(i)Medicare remains the primary payer when an individual becomes eligible for Medicare based on ESRD if all of the following conditions are met:

(A) The individual is already entitled on the basis of age or disability when he or she becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD.

(B) The MSP prohibition against "taking into account" age-based or disability-based entitlement does not apply because plan coverage was not "by virtue of current employment status" or the employer had fewer than 20 employees (in the case of the aged) or fewer than 100 employees (in the case of the disabled).

(C) The plan is paying secondary to Medicare because the plan had justifiably taken into account the age-based or disability-based entitlement.
