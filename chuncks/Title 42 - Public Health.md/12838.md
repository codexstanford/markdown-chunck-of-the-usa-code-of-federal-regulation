####### Collection of an application fee.

(c)In accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 9701, Fees and charges for Government services and things of value, CMS determines the amount of the application fee that must be submitted with each type of application.

(1) The fee is reasonably related to the Federal government's cost of qualifying an entity and may vary based on the type of application.

(2) Each type of application has one set fee rather than a charge based on the specific cost of each determination. (For example, each Federally qualified HMO applicant seeking Federal qualification of one of its regional components as an HMO is charged the same amount, unless the amount of the fee has been changed under paragraph (f) of this section.)
