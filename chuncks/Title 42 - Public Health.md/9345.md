####### ยง 412.336 Transition period payment methodologies.
######## Special rule for revised hospital-specific rate.

(b)If a hospital with a hospital-specific rate below the Federal rate requests that its hospital-specific rate be redetermined, the redetermined hospital-specific rate is compared to the Federal rate that is applicable to the new base period (after taking into account the estimated effect of the payment adjustments and outlier payments). If the redetermined hospital-specific rate is higher than the Federal rate, the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless methodology effective with the beginning of the new base period and continuing throughout the remainder of the transition.
