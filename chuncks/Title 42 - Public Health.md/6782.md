####### Special rule: Additional SEPs.

(d)(1) Generally, if an individual fails to enroll during any available SEP, he or she is not entitled to any additional SEPs.

(2) However, if an individual fails to enroll during a SEP, because coverage under the same or a different GHP or LGHP was restored before the end of that particular SEP, that failure to enroll does not preclude additional SEPs.
