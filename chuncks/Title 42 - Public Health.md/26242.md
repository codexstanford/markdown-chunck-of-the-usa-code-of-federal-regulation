####### Application.

(a)(1) CMS may require continuous or intermittent monitoring of a plan of correction by the State survey agency to ensure that the laboratory makes the improvements necessary to bring it into compliance with the condition level requirements. (The State monitor does not have management authority, that is, cannot hire or fire staff, obligate funds, or otherwise dictate how the laboratory operates. The monitor's responsibility is to oversee whether corrections are made.)

(2) The laboratory must pay the costs of onsite monitoring by the State survey agency.

(i) The costs are computed by multiplying the number of hours of onsite monitoring in the laboratory by the hourly rate negotiated by CMS and the State.

(ii) The hourly rate includes salary, fringe benefits, travel, and other direct and indirect costs approved by CMS.
