(A) If the individual files a request within 30 days after the date of CMS's notice that buy-in coverage has ended, the individual's entitlement ends on the last day of the last month for which the State paid the premium.

(B) If the individual files the request more than 30 days but not more than 6 months after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends on the last day of the month in which the request is filed.

(C) If the individual files the request later than the 6th month after buy-in coverage ends, entitlement ends at the end of the month after the month in which request is filed.
