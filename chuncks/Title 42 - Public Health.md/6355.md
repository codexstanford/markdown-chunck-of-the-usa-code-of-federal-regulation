####### A reviewing entity.

(2)For purposes of this definition, a reviewing entity is deemed to include the Office of the Attorney Advisor. The determination as to the date of receipt by the reviewing entity to which the document or other material was submitted (as permitted under paragraph (d) of this section) is final and binding as to all parties to the appeal. The date of receipt of documents by a reviewing entity is presumed to be, as applicable, one of the following dates:

(i) Of delivery where the document or material is transmitted by a nationally-recognized next-day courier (such as the United States Postal Service's Express Mail, Federal Express, UPS, DHL, etc.).

(ii) Stamped "Received" by the reviewing entity on the document or other submitted material (where a nationally-recognized next-day courier is not employed). This presumption, which is otherwise conclusive, may be overcome if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the document or other material was actually received on a different date.
