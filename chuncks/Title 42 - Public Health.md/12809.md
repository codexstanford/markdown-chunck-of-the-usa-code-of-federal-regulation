####### Grievance procedures.

(g)Each HMO must have and use meaningful procedures for hearing and resolving grievances between the HMO's enrollees and the HMO, including the HMO staff and medical groups and IPAs that furnish services. These procedures must ensure that:

(1) Grievances and complaints are transmitted in a timely manner to appropriate HMO decisionmaking levels that have authority to take corrective action; and

(2) Appropriate action is taken promptly, including a full investigation if necessary and notification of concerned parties as to the results of the HMO's investigation.
