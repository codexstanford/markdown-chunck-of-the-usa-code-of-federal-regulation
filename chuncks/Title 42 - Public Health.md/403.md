### Subchapter A - General Provisions
#### PART 5 - DESIGNATION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONAL(S) SHORTAGE AREAS
##### Appendix B to Part 5 - Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages of Dental Professional(s)
###### Criteria

1.

Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having a shortage of dental professional(s) if both the following criteria are met:

(a) The institution has at least 250 inmates.

(b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of FTE dentists serving the institution is at least 1,500:1.

Here the number of internees is defined as follows:

(i) If the number of new inmates per year and the average length-of-stay are not specified, or if the information provided does not indicate that intake dental examinations are routinely performed by dentists upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates.

(ii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as one year or more, and intake dental examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates + number of new inmates per year.

(iii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as less than one year, and intake dental examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then-Number of internees = average number of inmates +x (1 + 2 x ALOS) x number of new inmates per year where ALOS = average length-of-stay (in fraction of year).

2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.

Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups based on the number of inmates and/or the ratio (R) of internees to dentists, as follows:

Group 1-Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no dentists.

Group 2-Other institutions with no dentists and institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 3,000:1.

Group 3-Institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 1,500:1 but less than 3,000:1.
