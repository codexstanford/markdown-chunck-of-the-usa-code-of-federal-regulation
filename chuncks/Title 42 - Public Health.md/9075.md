######## Calculation of the Total Performance Score.

(b)The hospital's Total Performance Score for a program year is calculated as follows:

(1) CMS will calculate a domain score for a hospital when it reports the minimum number of measures in the domain.

(2) CMS will sum all points awarded for each measure in a domain to calculate an unweighted domain score.

(3) CMS will normalize each domain score to ensure that it is expressed as a percentage of points earned out of 100.

(4) CMS will weight the domain scores with the finalized domain weights for each fiscal year.

(5) The sum of the weighted domain scores is the hospital's Total Performance Score for the fiscal year.
