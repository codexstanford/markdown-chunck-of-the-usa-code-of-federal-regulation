(e)(1) CMS makes an adjustment to the standardized amount to ensure that-

(i) Changes to the DRG classifications and recalibrations of the DRG relative weights are made in a manner so that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected; and

(ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4) and (h)(4)(vii) of this section, the annual updates and adjustments to the wage index under paragraph (h) of this section are made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments are not affected; and

(2) CMS also makes an adjustment to the rates to ensure that aggregate payments after implementation of reclassifications under subpart L of this part are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made in the absence of these provisions.

(3) To the extent CMS determines that changes to the DRG classification and recalibrations of the DRG relative weights for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in coding or classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix, CMS may adjust the standardized amount for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding and classification changes.

(4) CMS makes an adjustment to the wage index to ensure that aggregate payments after implementation of the rural floor under section 4410 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) and, for discharges on or after October 1, 2004, and before October 1, 2018, the imputed floor under paragraph (h)(4) of this section are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made in the absence of such provisions as follows :
