####### Interim payments after initial reporting period.

(e)Interim rates of payment for services provided after the initial reporting period will be established on the basis of the cost report filed for the previous year covering Medicare services. The current rate will be determined-whether on a per diem or percentage of charges basis-using the previous year's costs of covered services and making any appropriate adjustments required to bring, as closely as possible, the current year's rate of interim payment into agreement with current year's costs. This interim rate of payment may be adjusted by the contractor during an accounting period if the provider submits appropriate evidence that its actual costs are or will be significantly higher than the computed rate. Likewise, the contractor may adjust the interim rate of payment if it has evidence that actual costs may fall significantly below the computed rate.
