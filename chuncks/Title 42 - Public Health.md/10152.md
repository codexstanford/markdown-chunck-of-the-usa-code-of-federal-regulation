###### § 413.79 Direct GME payments: Determination of the weighted number of FTE residents.
####### Weighted FTE counts.

(d)Subject to the provisions of § 413.81, for purposes of determining direct GME payment-

(1) For the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the hospital's weighted FTE count is equal to the average of the weighted FTE count for the payment year cost reporting period and the preceding cost reporting period.

(2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1998, and before October 1, 2001, the hospital's weighted FTE count is equal to the average of the weighted FTE count for the payment year cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods.

(3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001, the hospital's weighted FTE count for primary care and obstetrics and gynecology residents is equal to the average of the weighted primary care and obstetrics and gynecology counts for the payment year cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods, and the hospital's weighted FTE count for nonprimary care residents is equal to the average of the weighted nonprimary care FTE counts for the payment year cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001, the hospital's weighted FTE counts for the preceding two cost reporting periods are calculated in accordance with the payment formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

(4) The contractor may make appropriate modifications to apply the provisions of this paragraph (d) based on the equivalent of 12-month cost reporting periods.

(5) (i) For new programs started prior to October 1, 2012, if a hospital qualifies for an adjustment to the limit established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for new medical residency programs created under paragraph (e) of this section, the count of the residents participating in new medical residency training programs above the number included in the hospital's FTE count for the cost reporting period ending during calendar year 1996 is added after applying the averaging rules in this paragraph (d), for a period of years. Residents participating in new medical residency training programs are included in the hospital's FTE count before applying the averaging rules after the period of years has expired. For purposes of this paragraph (d), for each new program started, the period of years equals the minimum accredited length for each new program. The period of years begins when the first resident begins training in each new program.

(ii) For new programs started on or after October 1, 2012, for hospitals for which the FTE cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e), FTE residents participating in new medical residency training programs are excluded from the hospital's FTE count before applying the averaging rules during the cost reporting periods prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started, for hospitals for which the FTE may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(1), and prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the each individual new program started, for hospitals for which the FTE cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(3). Beginning with the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started for hospitals for which the FTE cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(1), and beginning with the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the each individual new program started for hospitals for which the FTE cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(3), FTE residents participating in new medical residency training programs are included in the hospital's FTE count before applying the averaging rules.

(6)(i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section, FTE residents who are displaced by the closure of either another hospital or another hospital's program are added to the FTE count after applying the averaging rules in this paragraph (d), for the receiving hospital for the duration of the time that the displaced residents are training at the receiving hospital.

(ii) If a hospital receives a permanent increase in its FTE resident cap under paragraph (o)(1) of this section due to redistribution of slots from a closed hospital, the displaced FTE residents that the hospital receives are added to the FTE count after applying the averaging rules only in the first cost reporting period in which the receiving hospital trains the displaced FTE residents. In subsequent cost reporting periods, the displaced FTE residents are included in the receiving hospital's rolling average calculation.

(7) (i) Subject to the provisions under paragraph (k) of this section, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2000 and before cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2022, FTE residents in a rural track program at an urban hospital are included in the urban hospital's rolling average calculation described in this paragraph (d).

(ii) Subject to the provisions under paragraph (k) of this section, effective for rural track programs started in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2022, FTE residents in a rural track program at an urban hospital or rural hospital are excluded from rolling average calculation described in this paragraph (d) during the cost reporting periods prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of each rural track.
