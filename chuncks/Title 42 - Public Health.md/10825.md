For the first cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1998, payment is based on 75 percent of the facility-specific rate and 25 percent of the Federal rate. For the subsequent cost reporting period, the rate is comprised of 50 percent of the facility-specific rate and 50 percent of the Federal rate. In the final cost reporting period of the transition, the rate is comprised of 25 percent of the facility-specific rate and 75 percent of the Federal rate. For all subsequent cost reporting periods, payment is based entirely on the Federal rate.
