###### ยง 417.106 Quality assurance program; Availability, accessibility, and continuity of basic and supplemental health services.
####### Exception.

(2)If the HMO's service area is located wholly within a nonmetropolitan area, the HMO may make available outside its service area any basic health service that is not a primary care or emergency care service, if the number of providers of that basic health service who will provide the service to the HMO's enrollees is insufficient to meet the demand. As used in this paragraph, primary care includes general practice, family practice, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and general obstetrics and gynecology. An HMO that provides the services covered by these fields through at least a general or family practitioner, or a pediatrician and a general internist, is considered to be providing primary care.

(3) The services must be available and accessible with reasonable promptness to each of the HMO's enrollees as ensured through-

(i) Staffing patterns within generally accepted norms for meeting the projected enrollment needs; and

(ii) Geographic location, hours of operation, and arrangements for after-hours services. (Medically necessary emergency services must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.)
