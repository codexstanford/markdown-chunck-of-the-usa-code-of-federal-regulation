####### Withdrawal of request.

(c)At any time before notice of the decision, dismissal, or remand is mailed, if the enrollee asks to withdraw the request, an ALJ or attorney adjudicator may dismiss the request for hearing or request for review of an IRE dismissal. This request for withdrawal may be submitted in writing, or a request to withdraw a request for hearing may be made orally at a hearing before the ALJ. The request for withdrawal must include a clear statement that the enrollee is withdrawing the request for hearing or review of the IRE dismissal and does not intend to further proceed with the appeal. If an attorney or other legal professional on behalf of an enrollee files the request for withdrawal, the ALJ or attorney adjudicator may presume that the representative has advised the enrollee of the consequences of the withdrawal and dismissal.
