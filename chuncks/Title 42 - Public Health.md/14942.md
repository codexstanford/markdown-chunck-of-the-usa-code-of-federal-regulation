####### Subordinated debt

means an obligation that is owed by an organization, that the creditor of the obligation, by law, agreement, or otherwise, has a lower repayment rank in the hierarchy of creditors than another creditor. The creditor would be entitled to repayment only after all higher ranking creditors' claims have been satisfied. A debt is fully subordinated if it has a lower repayment rank than all other classes of creditors.
