####### Services.

(c)Medicare Part B covers nurse practitioners' services in all settings in both rural and urban areas, only if the services would be covered if furnished by a physician and the nurse practitioner-

(1) Is legally authorized to perform them in the State in which they are performed;

(2) Is not performing services that are otherwise excluded from coverage because of one of the statutory exclusions; and

(3) Performs them while working in collaboration with a physician.

(i) Collaboration is a process in which a nurse practitioner works with one or more physicians to deliver health care services within the scope of the practitioner's expertise, with medical direction and appropriate supervision as provided for in jointly developed guidelines or other mechanisms as provided by the law of the State in which the services are performed.

(ii) In the absence of State law governing collaboration, collaboration is a process in which a nurse practitioner has a relationship with one or more physicians to deliver health care services. Such collaboration is to be evidenced by nurse practitioners documenting the nurse practitioners' scope of practice and indicating the relationships that they have with physicians to deal with issues outside their scope of practice. Nurse practitioners must document this collaborative process with physicians.

(iii) The collaborating physician does not need to be present with the nurse practitioner when the services are furnished or to make an independent evaluation of each patient who is seen by the nurse practitioner.
