(2)The contractor makes the final determination on the SNF's exception request and notifies the SNF of its determination within 90 days from the date that the contractor receives the request from the SNF. If the contractor determines that the SNF did not provide adequate documentation from which a proper determination can be made, the contractor notifies the SNF that the request is denied. The contractor also notifies the SNF that it has 45 days from the date on the contractor's denial letter to submit a new exception request with the complete documentation and that otherwise, the denial is the final determination. The time required by the contractor to review the request is considered good cause for the granting of an extension of the time limit for requesting an contractor hearing or a Board hearing as specified in §§ 405.1813 and 405.1836 of this chapter, respectively.
