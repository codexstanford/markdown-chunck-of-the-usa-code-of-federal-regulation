####### Effect of reporting collections and submitting reduced expenditure claims.

(b)(1) The State is not required to refund the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period if the State has already reported a collection or submitted an expenditure claim reduced by a discrete amount to recover the overpayment prior to the end of the 1-year period following discovery.

(2) The State is not required to report on the Form CMS-64 any collections made on overpayment amounts for which the Federal share has been refunded previously.

(3) If a State has refunded the Federal share of an overpayment as required under this subpart and the State subsequently makes recovery by reducing future provider payments by a discrete amount, the State need not reflect that reduction in its claim for Federal financial participation.
