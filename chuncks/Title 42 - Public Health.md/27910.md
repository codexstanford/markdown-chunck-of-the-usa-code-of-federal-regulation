(3)(i) The methodology for accruing, calculating and verifying internal cost savings must be transparent, measurable, and verifiable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book).

(ii) The methodology used to calculate internal cost savings must reflect the actual, internal cost savings achieved by the participant hospital through the documented implementation of CJR activities identified by the participant hospital and must exclude-

(A) Any savings realized by any individual or entity that is not the participant hospital; and

(B) "Paper" savings from accounting conventions or past investment in fixed costs.

(4) The total amount of a gainsharing payment for a performance year paid to a CJR collaborator must not exceed the following:

(i) For episodes beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and ending on or before September 30, 2021, in the case of a CJR collaborator who is a physician or non-physician practitioner, 50 percent of the Medicare-approved amounts under the PFS for items and services furnished by that physician or non-physician practitioner to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries during CJR model episodes that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment being made.

(ii) For episodes beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and ending on or before September 30, 2021, in the case of a CJR collaborator that is a PGP or NPPGP, 50 percent of the Medicare-approved amounts under the PFS for items and services billed by that PGP or NPPGP and furnished to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries by the PGP members or NPPGP members respectively during CJR model episodes that occurred during the same performance year for which the participant hospital accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment being made.

(5) The amount of any gainsharing payments must be determined in accordance with a methodology that is substantially based on quality of care and the provision of CJR activities. The methodology may take into account the amount of such CJR activities provided by a CJR collaborator relative to other CJR collaborators.

(6) For a performance year, the aggregate amount of all gainsharing payments that are derived from a reconciliation payment the CJR participant hospital receives from CMS must not exceed the amount of that reconciliation payment.

(7) No entity or individual, whether a party to a sharing arrangement or not, may condition the opportunity to make or receive gainsharing payments or to make or receive alignment payments directly or indirectly on the volume or value of past or anticipated referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, any CJR collaborator, any collaboration agent, any downstream collaboration agent, or any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital, CJR collaborator, collaboration agent, or downstream collaboration agent.

(8) A participant hospital must not make a gainsharing payment to a CJR collaborator if CMS has notified the participant hospital that such collaborator is subject to any action for noncompliance with this part or the fraud and abuse laws, or for the provision of substandard care to CJR beneficiaries or other integrity problems.

(9) The sharing arrangement must require the participant hospital to recoup any gainsharing payment that contained funds derived from a CMS overpayment on a reconciliation report or was based on the submission of false or fraudulent data.

(10) Alignment payments from a CJR collaborator to a participant hospital may be made at any interval that is agreed upon by both parties, and must not be-

(i) Issued, distributed, or paid prior to the calculation by CMS of a repayment amount reflected in a reconciliation report;

(ii) Loans, advance payments, or payments for referrals or other business; or

(iii) Assessed by a participant hospital if it does not owe a repayment amount.

(11) The participant hospital must not receive any amounts under a sharing arrangement from a CJR collaborator that are not alignment payments.

(12) For a performance year, the aggregate amount of all alignment payments received by the participant hospital must not exceed 50 percent of the participant hospital's repayment amount.

(13) The aggregate amount of all alignment payments from a CJR collaborator to the participant hospital may not be greater than-

(i) With respect to a CJR collaborator other than an ACO, 25 percent of the participant hospital's repayment amount.

(ii) With respect to a CJR collaborator that is an ACO, 50 percent of the participant hospital's repayment amount.

(14) The amount of any alignment payments must be determined in accordance with a methodology that does not directly account for the volume or value of past or anticipated referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, any CJR collaborator, any collaboration agent, any downstream collaboration agent, or any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital, CJR collaborator, collaboration agent, or downstream collaboration agent.

(15) All gainsharing payments and any alignment payments must be administered by the participant hospital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book).

(16) All gainsharing payments and alignment payments must be made by check, electronic funds transfer, or another traceable cash transaction.
