###### ยง 110.32 Benefits for lost employment income.
####### e.g.,

(c) The Secretary does not require an individual to use paid leave (sick leave or vacation leave) for lost work days. However, if an individual uses paid leave for lost work days, the Secretary will not consider those days to be days of lost employment income unless the individual reimburses the employer for the paid leave taken and the employer restores the leave that was used. This puts the individual back in the same position as if he or she had not used paid leave for the lost work days.

(d) The Secretary may pay benefits for lost employment income to the estate of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient as long as such benefits were accrued during the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's lifetime as the result of a covered injury or its health complications, and were not paid in full by the Program before the deceased injured countermeasure recipient died. However, no such lost employment income may be paid after the receipt, by the survivor or survivors of a deceased injured countermeasure recipient, of death benefits under ยง 110.82.
