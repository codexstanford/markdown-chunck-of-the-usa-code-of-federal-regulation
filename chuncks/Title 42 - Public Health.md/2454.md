####### Requested deferment.

(a)Upon the request of any participant receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy, or dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy, the Secretary will defer the beginning date of the obligated service to allow the participant to complete an approved graduate training program. The period of this deferment may not exceed (1) three years for any participant receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy or dentistry, or (2) one year for any participant receiving a degree from a school of veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy.
