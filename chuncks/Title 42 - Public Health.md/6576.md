######## Treatment of beneficiaries.

(e)(1) The FQHC must agree to accept Medicare beneficiaries for care and treatment.

(2) The FQHC may not impose any limitations with respect to care and treatment of Medicare beneficiaries that it does not also impose upon all other persons seeking care and treatment from the FQHC. Failure to comply with this requirement is a cause for termination of the FQHC's agreement with CMS in accordance with ยง 405.2436(d).

(3) If the FQHC does not furnish treatment for certain illnesses and conditions to patients who are not Medicare beneficiaries, it need not furnish such treatment to Medicare beneficiaries.
