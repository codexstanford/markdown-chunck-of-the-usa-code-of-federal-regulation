####### Determination of an increase in the otherwise applicable resident cap under section 5503 of Public Law 111-148.

(n)(1) For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2011, a hospital may receive an increase in its otherwise applicable FTE resident cap (as determined by CMS) of not more than 75 additional FTEs if the hospital meets the requirements and qualifying criteria of section 1886(h)(8) of the Act and implementing instructions issued by CMS and if the hospital submits an application to CMS within the timeframe specified by CMS.

(2) A hospital that receives an increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap under paragraph (n)(1) of this section must ensure, during the 5-year period beginning on July 1, 2011 and ending on June 30, 2016, that-

(i) The number of FTE primary care residents, as defined in ยง 413.75(b), excluding any additional positions under this paragraph, is not less than the average number of FTE primary care residents (as so determined) during the three most recent cost reporting periods ending prior to March 23, 2010 (and submitted to the Medicare contractor by March 23, 2010); and not less than 75 percent of the positions attributable to such increase are in a primary care or general surgery residency programs.

(ii) If a hospital receives an increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, and does not use all of that increase in its final (12-month or partial) cost report of the 5-year period beginning July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2016, the Medicare contractor will remove the applicable unused slots, and the hospital's increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap received under paragraph (n)(1) of this section will be reduced for portions of cost reporting periods on or after July 1, 2016. The number of applicable unused slots is equal to the difference between the increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap and the applicable slots used. In determining the applicable slots used, the following amounts are added, as relevant:

(A) If a hospital uses the increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap under paragraph (n)(1) of this section to expand an existing program(s), the used slots are equal to the lesser of the number of slots used for an expansion(s) in the fourth 12-month cost report or the final cost report.

(B) If a hospital uses the increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap under paragraph (n)(1) of this section to start a new program(s), the used slots are equal to the number of slots used for a new program(s) in the final cost report.

(C) The portion, if any, of the increase in the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap under paragraph (n)(1) of this section used for cap relief, subject to the requirements in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section.

(iii) CMS may determine whether a hospital has met the requirements under paragraphs (n)(2)(i) and (n)(2)(ii) of this section during the 5-year period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2016, in such manner and at such time as CMS determines appropriate, including at the end of such 5-year period.

(iv) In a case where the Medicare contractor determines that a hospital did not meet the requirements under paragraphs (n)(2)(i), (n)(2)(ii), and (n)(2)(iii) of this section in a cost reporting period within the 5-year time period, the Medicare contractor will reduce the otherwise applicable FTE resident cap of the hospital by the amount by which such limit was increased under paragraph (n)(1) of this section from the earliest cost reporting period that is reopenable in which it would be determined that the hospital did not meet the requirements.
