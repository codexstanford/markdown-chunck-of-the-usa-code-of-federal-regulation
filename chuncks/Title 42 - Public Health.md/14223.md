####### calculation of the actuarially equivalent copayment differential.

(i) CMSFor purposes of this section, the actuarially equivalent copayment differential is as follows:

(A) For cost sharing at the mandatory and lower MOOP limits, the difference between, first, the copayment limit set for a plan benefit package service category based on the MOOP type for 2022 and second, the copayment value for the same service category that is actuarially equivalent to the coinsurance limits in paragraphs (f)(6)(iii) and (j)(1) of this section that apply in 2026 based on the MOOP type, using the Medicare FFS data projections that are updated each year to reflect the costs of the contract year for which the copayment limit will apply.

(B) For cost sharing at the intermediate MOOP limit, the difference between, first, the copayment limit set for a plan benefit package service category based on the mandatory MOOP type for 2022 and second, the copayment value for the same service category that is actuarially equivalent to the coinsurance limits in paragraphs (f)(6)(iii) and (j)(1) of this section that apply in 2026 for the intermediate MOOP type, using the Medicare FFS data projections that are updated each year to reflect the costs of the contract year for which the copayment limit will apply.
