####### Secondary outcome measure

means an outcome measure that is of lesser importance than a primary outcome measure, but is part of a pre-specified analysis plan for evaluating the effects of the intervention or interventions under investigation in a clinical trial and is not specified as an exploratory or other measure. A clinical trial may have more than one secondary outcome measure. For purposes of this part, "secondary outcome" has the same meaning as secondary outcome measure.
