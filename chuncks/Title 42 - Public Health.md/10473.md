####### 5

() For assets subject to the optional depreciation allowance as described in ยง 413.139, the acquisition cost to the owner of record is the historical cost established for those assets when the provider changed to actual depreciation as described in ยง 413.139(e). If the provider did not change to actual depreciation, as described in ยง 413.139(e), for optional allowance assets, the acquisition cost to the owner of record is based on the provider's recorded historical cost of the asset when acquired. If the provider has no historical cost records for optional allowance assets, the acquisition cost to the owner of record is established by appraisal.
