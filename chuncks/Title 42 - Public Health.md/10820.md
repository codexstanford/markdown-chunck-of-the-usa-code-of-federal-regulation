(1) CMS will provide quarterly confidential feedback reports to SNFs on their performance on each measure specified for the fiscal year. Beginning with the baseline period and performance period quality measure quarterly reports issued on or after October 1, 2021, which contain the baseline period and performance period measure rates, respectively, SNFs will have 30 days following the date CMS provides each of these reports to review and submit corrections to the measure rates contained in that report. The administrative claims data used to calculate measure rates are not subject to review and correction under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. All correction requests must be accompanied by appropriate evidence showing the basis for the correction to each of the applicable measure rates.

(2) Beginning not later than 60 days prior to each fiscal year, CMS will provide SNF performance score reports to SNFs on their performance under the SNF VBP Program for a fiscal year. SNFs will have the opportunity to review and submit corrections to their SNF performance scores and ranking contained in these reports for 30 days following the date that CMS provides the reports. Any such correction requests must be accompanied by appropriate evidence showing the basis for the correction.

(3) CMS will publicly report the information described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section on the Nursing Home Compare website or a successor website.

(i) If CMS determines that a SNF has fewer than 25 eligible stays during the baseline period for a fiscal year but has 25 or more eligible stays during the performance period for that fiscal year, CMS will not publicly report the SNF's baseline period SNF readmission measure rate and improvement score for that fiscal year;

(ii) If CMS determines that a SNF is a low-volume SNF with respect to a fiscal year and assigns a performance score to the SNF under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, CMS will not publicly report the SNF's performance period SNF readmission measure rate, achievement score or improvement score for the fiscal year; and

(iii) If CMS determines that a SNF has zero eligible cases during the performance period with respect to a fiscal year, CMS will not publicly report any information for that SNF for that fiscal year.

(4) Beginning with the information publicly reported on or after October 1, 2022, the following exceptions apply:

(i) If a SNF does not have the minimum number of cases during the baseline period that applies to a measure for a fiscal year, CMS will not publicly report the SNF's baseline period measure rate for that particular measure, although CMS will publicly report the SNF's performance period measure rate and achievement score if the SNF had the minimum number of cases for the measure during the performance period of the same program year;

(ii) If a SNF does not have the minimum number of cases during the performance period that applies to a measure for a fiscal year, CMS will not publicly report any information with respect to the SNF's performance on that measure for the fiscal year;

(iii) If a SNF does not have the minimum number of measures during the performance period for a fiscal year, CMS will not publicly report any data for that SNF for the fiscal year.
