## Chapter IV - Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services
### Subchapter C - Medical Assistance Programs
#### PART 441 - SERVICES: REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC SERVICES
##### Subpart G - Home and Community-Based Services: Waiver Requirements
###### ยง 441.304 Duration, extension, and amendment of a waiver.

(a) The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to provide home and community-based services approved under this subpart is established by CMS prospectively on or after the date of approval and after consultation with the State agency. The initial approved waiver continues for a 3-year period from the effective date. If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended for additional periods unless-

(1) CMS's review of the prior waiver period shows that the assurances required by ยง 441.302 were not met; and

(2) CMS is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation provided by the State in regard to the extension period.

(b) CMS will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request or a request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to the existing group of beneficiaries covered under the waiver (as defined under ยง 441.301(b)(6)), CMS will consider it to be two requests: One as an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended for additional 5-year periods.
