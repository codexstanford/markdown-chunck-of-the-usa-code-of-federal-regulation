###### ยง 405.1885 Reopening a contractor determination or reviewing entity decision.
####### Request for reopening of a determination not based on fraud or similar fault.

(2)(i) A reopening made upon request is timely only if the request to reopen is received by CMS, the contractor, or reviewing entity, as appropriate, no later than 3 years after the date of the determination or decision that is the subject of the requested reopening. The date of receipt by CMS, the contractor, or the reviewing entity of the request to reopen is determined by applying the date of receipt presumption criteria for reviewing entities defined in ยง 405.1801(a), unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that CMS, the contractor, or the reviewing entity received the request on an earlier date.

(ii) A request to reopen does not toll the time in which to appeal an otherwise appealable determination or decision.

(iii) A request to reopen that is received within the 3-year period described in this paragraph is timely, notwithstanding that the notice of reopening required under ยง 405.1887 of this subpart is issued after such 3-year period.

(iv) The 3-year period described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section applies to, and is calculated separately for, each specific finding on a matter at issue (as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section, but not to such findings when made as part of a determination of reasonable cost under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act.
