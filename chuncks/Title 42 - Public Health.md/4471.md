####### Basic determination.

(c)(1) Payment for hospital services that the Medicare program would pay under a prospective payment system (PPS) will be based on that PPS. For example, payment for inpatient hospital services shall be made per discharge based on the applicable PPS used by the Medicare program to pay for similar hospital services under 42 CFR part 412. Payment for outpatient hospital services shall be made based on a PPS used in the Medicare program to pay for similar hospital services under 42 CFR part 419. Payment for skilled nursing facility (SNF) services shall be based on a PPS used in the Medicare program to pay for similar SNF services under 42 CFR part 413.

(2) For Medicare participating hospitals that furnish inpatient services but are exempt from PPS and receive reimbursement based on reasonable costs (for example, critical access hospitals (CAHs), children's hospitals, cancer hospitals, and certain other hospitals reimbursed by Medicare under special arrangements), including provider subunits exempt from PPS, payment shall be made per discharge based on the reasonable cost methods established under 42 CFR part 413, except that the interim payment rate under 42 CFR part 413, subpart E shall constitute payment in full for authorized charges.
