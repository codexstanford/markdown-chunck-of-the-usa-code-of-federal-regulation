###### ยง 405.504 Determining prevailing charges.
####### Variation in range of prevailing charges.

(b)The range of prevailing charges in a locality may be different for physicians or other persons who engage in a specialty practice or service than for others. Existing differentials in the level of charges between different kinds of practice or service could, in some localities, lead to the development of more than one range of prevailing charges for application by the carrier in its determinations of reasonable charges. Carrier decisions in this respect should be responsive to the existing patterns of charges by physicians and other persons who render covered services, and should establish differentials in the levels of charges between different kinds of practice or service only where in accord with such patterns.
