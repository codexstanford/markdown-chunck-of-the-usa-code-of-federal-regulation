####### ยง 435.541 Determinations of disability.
######## Determinations made by SSA.

(a)The following rules and those under paragraph (b) of this section apply where an individual has applied for Medicaid on the basis of disability.

(1) If the agency has an agreement with the Social Security Administration (SSA) under section 1634 of the Act, the agency may not make a determination of disability when the only application is filed with SSA.

(2) The agency may not make an independent determination of disability if SSA has made a disability determination within the time limits set forth in ยง 435.912 on the same issues presented in the Medicaid application. A determination of eligibility for SSI payments based on disability that is made by SSA automatically confers Medicaid eligibility, as provided for under ยง 435.909.
