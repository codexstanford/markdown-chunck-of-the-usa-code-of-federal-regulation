####### Incentive.

(1)As an incentive for funding, investment income on funded depreciation is not treated as a reduction of allowable interest expense provided such investment income is deposited in, and becomes part of, the funded depreciation account at the time of receipt by the provider. Investment income earned on deposits before the 6-month period elapses are not offset unless the deposits are withdrawn for an improper purpose during this period. If a provider transfers assets of the funded depreciation account to a related organization (for example, pooling of several chain organization providers' funded depreciation accounts at the chain home office for investment purposes), these assets shall be treated as the provider's funds and are subject to all the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
