####### Reconsiderations and appeals of Hospital OQR Program decisions.

(g)(1) A hospital may request reconsideration of a decision by CMS that the hospital has not met the requirements of the Hospital OQR Program in paragraph (b) of this section for a particular calendar year. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a hospital must submit a reconsideration request to CMS via the QualityNet website, no later than March 17, or if March 17 falls on a nonwork day, on the first day after March 17 which is not a nonwork day as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, of the affected payment year as determined using the date the request was mailed or submitted to CMS.

(2) A reconsideration request must contain the following information:

(i) The hospital's CMS Certification Number (CCN);

(ii) The name of the hospital;

(iii) The CMS-identified reason for not meeting the requirements of the affected payment year's Hospital OQR Program as provided in any CMS notification to the hospital;

(iv) The hospital's basis for requesting reconsideration. The hospital must identify its specific reason(s) for believing it should not be subject to the reduced annual payment update;

(v) The hospital-designated personnel contact information, including name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address (must include physical mailing address, not just a post office box);

(vi) The hospital-designated personnel's signature;

(vii) A copy of all materials that the hospital submitted to comply with the requirements of the affected Hospital OQR Program payment determination year; and

(viii) If the hospital is requesting reconsideration on the basis that CMS determined it did not meet the affected payment determination year's validation requirement set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the hospital must provide a written justification for each appealed data element classified during the validation process as a mismatch. Only data elements that affect a hospital's validation score are eligible to be reconsidered.

(3) A hospital that is dissatisfied with a decision made by CMS on its reconsideration request may file an appeal with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board under part 405, subpart R, of this chapter.
