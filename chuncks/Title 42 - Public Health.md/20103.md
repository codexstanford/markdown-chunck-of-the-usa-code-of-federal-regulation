(c)The agency must make a determination of disability in accordance with the requirements of this section if any of the following circumstances exist:

(1) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary and has not applied to SSA for SSI cash benefits, whether or not a State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA; or an individual applies for Medicaid and has applied to SSA for SSI benefits and is found ineligible for SSI for a reason other than disability.

(2) The individual applies both to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State agency has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and SSA has not made an SSI disability determination within 90 days from the date of the individual's application for Medicaid.

(3) The individual applies to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State does not have a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and either the State uses more restrictive criteria than SSI for determining Medicaid eligibility under its section 1902(f) option or, in the case of a State that uses SSI criteria, SSA has not made an SSI disability determination in time for the State to comply with the Medicaid time limit for making a prompt determination on an individual's application for Medicaid.

(4) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary, whether or not the State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and-

(i) Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making its determination; or

(ii) Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination and alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and has not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these allegations.
