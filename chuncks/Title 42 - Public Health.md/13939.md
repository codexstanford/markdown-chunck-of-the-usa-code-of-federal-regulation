####### Publication of criteria and standards.

(c)Before the beginning of each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October 1-September 30, CMS publishes the performance criteria and standards as a notice in theCMS may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. CMS interprets the statutory phrase "before the beginning of each evaluation period" as allowing publication of the criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as long as the evaluation period of the carriers for the new criteria and standards begins after the publication of the notice.
