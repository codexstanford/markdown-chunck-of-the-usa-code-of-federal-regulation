(2)If the total payments made to a RHC or FQHC for the reporting period exceed the total reimbursement due the RHC or FQHC for the period, the MAC arranges with the RHC or FQHC for repayment through a lump-sum refund, or, if that poses a hardship for the RHC or FQHC, through offset against subsequent payments or a combination of offset and refund. The repayment must be completed as quickly as possible, generally within 12 months from the date of the notice of program reimbursement. A longer repayment period may be agreed to by the MAC if the MAC is satisfied that unusual circumstances exist which warrant a longer period.
