###### ยง 417.104 Payment for basic health services.
####### Basic health services payment.

(a)Each HMO must provide or arrange for the provision of basic health services for a basic health services payment that:

(1) Is to be paid on a periodic basis without regard to the dates these services are provided;

(2) Is fixed without regard to the frequency, extent, or kind of basic health services actually furnished;

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, is fixed under a community rating system, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(4) May be supplemented by nominal copayments which may be required for the provision of specific basic health services. Each HMO may establish one or more copayment options calculated on the basis of a community rating system.

(i) An HMO may not impose copayment charges that exceed 50 percent of the total cost of providing any single service to its enrollees, nor in the aggregate more than 20 percent of the total cost of providing all basic health services.

(ii) To insure that copayments are not a barrier to the utilization of health services or enrollment in the HMO, an HMO may not impose copayment charges on any subscriber (or enrollees covered by the subscriber's contract with the HMO) in any calendar year, when the copayments made by the subscriber (or enrollees) in that calendar year total 200 percent of the total annual premium cost which that subscriber (or enrollees) would be required to pay if he (or they) were enrolled under an option with no copayments. This limitation applies only if the subscriber (or enrollees) demonstrates that copayments in that amount have been paid in that year.
