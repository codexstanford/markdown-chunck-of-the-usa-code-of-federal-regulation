######## Copyright or Mask Work Notice.

(s)A copyright or mask work notice may appear in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight of the drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright or mask work material and be limited to letters having a print size of .32 cm. to .64 cm. (toinches) high. The content of the notice must be limited to only those elements provided for by law. For example, "1983 John Doe" (17 U.S.C. 401) and "*M* John Doe" (17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current statutes, legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work, respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be permitted only if the authorization language set forth in ยง 1.71(e) is included at the beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.
