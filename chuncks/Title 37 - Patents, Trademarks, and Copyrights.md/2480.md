###### Computation of the copyright royalty fee: Partially distant stations.

(h)A cable system located partly within and partly without the local service area of a primary television transmitter ("partially distant station") computes the royalty fee specified in section 111(d)(1)(B) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the Copyright Act ("DSE fee") by excluding gross receipts from subscribers located within that station's local service area from total gross receipts. A cable system which carries two or more partially distant stations with local service areas that do not exactly coincide shall compute a separate DSE fee for each group of subscribers who are located outside of the local service areas of exactly the same complement of distant stations. Computation of the DSE fee for each subscriber group is to be based on:

(1) The total distant signal equivalents of that group's complement of distant stations, and

(2) The total gross receipts from that group of subscribers. The copyright royalty fee for that cable system is:

(i) The total of the subscriber group royalty fees thus computed, or

(ii) 1.013 of 1 percent of the system's gross receipts from all subscribers, whichever is larger.
