####### e.g.,,i.e.,

(ii) For Bundled Subscription Offerings where either one or more components of the Bundle are not products or services of the Service Provider (including Affiliates) or the Service Provider (including Affiliates) does not make the Bundle available to End Users directly, then the revenue from End Users deemed to be recognized by the Service Provider for the purpose of paragraph (1) of this definition shall be the revenue recognized by the Service Provider from the Bundle multiplied by a fraction where the numerator is the standalone retail price of the Subscription Offering component in the Bundle and the denominator is the sum of the standalone retail prices of each of the components of the Bundle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, where the Service Provider does not recognize revenue for one or more components of the Bundle, then the standalone price(s) of the component(s) for which revenue is not recognized shall not be included in the calculation of the denominator of the fraction described in this sub-paragraph (where a Bundle of three services, each with a standalone price of $20/month, sells for $50/month, and the Service Provider recognizes $30,000 of revenue from the provision of only two of those services, one of which is a Subscription Offering, then the fraction shall be $20 divided by $40,, resulting in Service Provider Revenue of $15,000).

(iii) For the calculations in paragraphs (5)(i) and (ii) of this definition, in the event that there is no standalone published price for a component of the Bundle, then the Service Provider shall use the average standalone published price for End Users for the most closely comparable product or service in the U.S. or, if more than one comparable exists, the average of standalone prices for comparables. If no reasonably comparable product or service exists in the U.S., then the Service Provider may use another good faith, reasonable measure of the market value of the component.
