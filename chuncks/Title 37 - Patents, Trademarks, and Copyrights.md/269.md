######## Scale.

(k)The scale to which a drawing is made must be large enough to show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced in size to two-thirds in reproduction. Indications such as "actual size" or "scale" on the drawings are not permitted since these lose their meaning with reproduction in a different format.
