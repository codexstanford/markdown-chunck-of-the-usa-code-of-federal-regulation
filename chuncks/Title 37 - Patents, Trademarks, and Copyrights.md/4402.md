(e)Commencing with the first semiannual accounting period of 2019 and for each semiannual accounting period thereafter, in the case of an affected cable system filing Form SA3 as referenced in 37 CFR 201.17(d)(2)(ii) (2014), the royalty rate shall be, in addition to the amounts specified in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, a surcharge of 0.025 percent of the affected cable system's gross receipts for the secondary transmission to subscribers of each live television broadcast of a sports event where the secondary transmission of that broadcast would have been subject to deletion under the FCC Sports Blackout Rule. For purposes of this paragraph:

(1) The term "cable system" shall have the same meaning as in 17 U.S.C. 111(f)(3);

(2) An "affected cable system"-

(i) Is a "community unit," as the comparable term is defined or interpreted in accordance with § 76.5(dd) of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, in effect as of November 23, 2014, 47 CFR 76.5(dd) (2014);

(ii) That is located in whole or in part within the 35-mile specified zone of a television broadcast station licensed to a community in which a sports event is taking place, provided that if there is no television broadcast station licensed to the community in which a sports event is taking place, the applicable specified zone shall be that of the television broadcast station licensed to the community with which the sports event or team is identified, or, if the event or local team is not identified with any particular community, the nearest community to which a television station is licensed; and

(iii) Whose royalty fee is specified by 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(1)(B);

(3) A "television broadcast" of a sports event must qualify as a "non-network television program" within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(3)(A);

(4) The term "specified zone" shall be defined as the comparable term is defined or interpreted in accordance with § 76.5(e) of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect as of November 23, 2014, 47 CFR 76.5(e) (2014);

(5) The term "gross receipts" shall have the same meaning as in 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(1)(B) and shall include all gross receipts of the affected cable system during the semiannual accounting period except those from the affected cable system's subscribers who reside in:

(i) The local service area of the primary transmitter, as defined in 17 U.S.C. 111(f)(4);

(ii) Any community where the cable system has fewer than 1000 subscribers;

(iii) Any community located wholly outside the specified zone referenced in paragraph (e)(4) of this section; and

(iv) Any community where the primary transmitter was lawfully carried prior to March 31, 1972;

(6) The term "FCC Sports Blackout Rule" refers to § 76.111 of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect as of November 23, 2014, 47 CFR 76.111 (2014);

(7) Subject to paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the surcharge will apply to the secondary transmission of a primary transmission of a live television broadcast of a sports event only where the holder of the broadcast rights to the sports event or its agent has provided the affected cable system-

(i) Advance written notice regarding the secondary transmission as required by § 76.111(b) and (c) of the FCC Sports Blackout Rule; and

(ii) Documentary evidence that the specific team on whose behalf the notice is given had invoked the protection afforded by the FCC Sports Blackout Rule during the period from January 1, 2012, through November 23, 2014;

(8) In the case of collegiate sports events, the number of events involving a specific team as to which an affected cable system must pay the surcharge will be no greater than the largest number of events as to which the FCC Sports Blackout Rule was invoked in a particular geographic area by that team during any one of the accounting periods occurring between January 1, 2012, and November 23, 2014;

(9) Nothing herein shall preclude any copyright owner of a live television broadcast, the secondary transmission of which would have been subject to deletion under the FCC Sports Blackout Rule, from receiving a share of royalties paid pursuant to this paragraph (e).
