####### e.g.,

(2) Where computation of the attributable royalties depends on an input that is unable to be finally determined at the time the cumulative statement of account is delivered to the mechanical licensing collective and where the reason the input cannot be finally determined is outside of the digital music provider's control (the amount of applicable public performance royalties and the amount of applicable consideration for sound recording copyright rights), a reasonable estimation of such input, determined in accordance with GAAP, may be used or provided by the digital music provider. Royalty payments based on such estimates shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section after being finally determined. A cumulative statement of account containing an estimate permitted by this paragraph (d)(2) should identify each input that has been estimated, and provide the reason(s) why such input(s) needed to be estimated and an explanation as to the basis for the estimate(s).

(3) All information and calculations provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall be made in good faith and on the basis of the best knowledge, information, and belief of the digital music provider at the time the cumulative statement of account is delivered to the mechanical licensing collective, and subject to any additional accounting and certification requirements under 17 U.S.C. 115 and this section.

(e) For each sound recording embodying a musical work required to be reported under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the digital music provider shall provide the information referenced in ยง 210.6(c)(3) that would have been provided to the copyright owner had the digital music provider been serving Monthly Statements of Account as a compulsory licensee in accordance with this subpart on the copyright owner from initial use of the work, plus the unique identifier assigned by the digital music provider to the sound recording and a unique identifier assigned by the digital music provider to each individual usage line.

(f) The information required by paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (k), and (o) of this section requires intelligible, legible, and unambiguous statements in the cumulative statements of account, without incorporation of facts or information contained in other documents or records.

(g) References to part 385 of this title, as used in paragraphs (c), (d), and (k) of this section, refer to the rates and terms of royalty payments, including any defined activities or offerings, as in effect as to each particular reported use based on when the use occurred.

(h) If requested by a digital music provider, the mechanical licensing collective shall deliver an invoice and/or a response file to the digital music provider within a reasonable period of time after the cumulative statement of account and related royalties are received. The response file shall contain such information as is common in the industry to be reported in response files, backup files, and any other similar such files provided to digital music providers by applicable third-party administrators.

(i)(1) To the extent practicable, each cumulative statement of account delivered to the mechanical licensing collective under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and each supplemental metadata report delivered to the mechanical licensing collective under paragraph (o) of this section, shall be delivered in a machine-readable format that is compatible with the information technology systems of the mechanical licensing collective as reasonably determined by the mechanical licensing collective and set forth on its website, taking into consideration relevant industry standards and the potential for different degrees of sophistication among digital music providers. The mechanical licensing collective must offer an option that is accessible to smaller digital music providers that may not be reasonably capable of complying with the requirements of a sophisticated reporting or data standard or format. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the mechanical licensing collective from adopting more than one reporting or data standard or format. A digital music provider may use an alternative reporting or data standard or format pursuant to an agreement with the mechanical licensing collective under paragraph (l) of this section, consent to which shall not be unreasonably withheld by the mechanical licensing collective.

(2) Royalty payments shall be delivered to the mechanical licensing collective in such manner and form as the mechanical licensing collective may reasonably determine and set forth on its website. A cumulative statement of account and its related royalty payment may be delivered together or separately, but if delivered separately, the payment must include information reasonably sufficient to allow the mechanical licensing collective to match the cumulative statement of account to the payment.

(j) Each cumulative statement of account delivered to the mechanical licensing collective under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be accompanied by:

(1) The name of the person who is signing and certifying the cumulative statement of account.

(2) A signature, which in the case of a digital music provider that is a corporation or partnership, shall be the signature of a duly authorized officer of the corporation or of a partner.

(3) The date of signature and certification.

(4) If the digital music provider is a corporation or partnership, the title or official position held in the partnership or corporation by the person who is signing and certifying the cumulative statement of account.

(5) One of the following statements:

(i) Statement one:

I certify that (1) I am duly authorized to sign this cumulative statement of account on behalf of the digital music provider, (2) I have examined this cumulative statement of account, and (3) all statements of fact contained herein are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and are made in good faith.

(ii) Statement two:

I certify that (1) I am duly authorized to sign this cumulative statement of account on behalf of the digital music provider, (2) I have prepared or supervised the preparation of the data used by the digital music provider and/or its agent to generate this cumulative statement of account, (3) such data is true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and was prepared in good faith, and (4) this cumulative statement of account was prepared by the digital music provider and/or its agent using processes and internal controls that were subject to an examination, during the past year, by a licensed certified public accountant in accordance with the attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the opinion of whom was that the processes and internal controls were suitably designed to generate monthly statements that accurately reflect, in all material respects, the digital music provider's usage of musical works, the statutory royalties applicable thereto, and any other data that is necessary for the proper calculation of the statutory royalties in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 115 and applicable regulations.

(6) A certification by a duly authorized officer of the digital music provider that the digital music provider has fulfilled the requirements of 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(10)(B)(i) and (ii) but has not been successful in locating or identifying the copyright owner.

(k)(1) A digital music provider may adjust its previously delivered cumulative statement of account, including related royalty payments, by delivering to the mechanical licensing collective a statement of adjustment.

(2) A statement of adjustment shall be clearly and prominently identified as a "Statement of Adjustment of a Cumulative Statement of Account."

(3) A statement of adjustment shall include a clear statement of the following information:

(i) The previously delivered cumulative statement of account, including related royalty payments, to which the adjustment applies.

(ii) The specific change(s) to the previously delivered cumulative statement of account, including a detailed description of any changes to any of the inputs upon which computation of the royalties payable by the digital music provider depends. Such description shall include the adjusted royalties payable and all information used to compute the adjusted royalties payable, in accordance with the requirements of this section and part 385 of this title, such that the mechanical licensing collective can provide a detailed and step-by-step accounting of the calculation of the adjustment under applicable provisions of this section and part 385 of this title, sufficient to allow each applicable copyright owner to assess the manner in which the digital music provider determined the adjustment and the accuracy of the adjustment. As appropriate, an adjustment may be calculated using estimates permitted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(iii) Where applicable, the particular sound recordings and uses to which the adjustment applies.

(iv) A description of the reason(s) for the adjustment.

(4) In the case of an underpayment of royalties, the digital music provider shall pay the difference to the mechanical licensing collective contemporaneously with delivery of the statement of adjustment or promptly after being notified by the mechanical licensing collective of the amount due. A statement of adjustment and its related royalty payment may be delivered together or separately, but if delivered separately, the payment must include information reasonably sufficient to allow the mechanical licensing collective to match the statement of adjustment to the payment.

(5) In the case of an overpayment of royalties, the mechanical licensing collective shall appropriately credit or offset the excess payment amount and apply it to the digital music provider's account, or upon request, issue a refund within a reasonable period of time.

(6)(i) A statement of adjustment must be delivered to the mechanical licensing collective no later than 6 months after the occurrence of any of the scenarios specified by paragraph (k)(6)(ii) of this section, where such an event necessitates an adjustment. Where more than one scenario applies to the same cumulative statement of account at different points in time, a separate 6-month period runs for each such triggering event. Where more than one scenario necessitates the same particular adjustment, the 6-month deadline to make the adjustment begins to run from the occurrence of the earliest triggering event.

(ii) A statement of adjustment may only be made:

(A) Except as otherwise provided for by paragraph (c)(5) of this section, where the digital music provider discovers, or is notified of by the mechanical licensing collective or a copyright owner, licensor, or author (or their respective representatives, including by an administrator or a collective management organization) of a relevant sound recording or musical work that is embodied in such a sound recording, an inaccuracy in the cumulative statement of account, or in the amounts of royalties owed, based on information that was not previously known to the digital music provider despite its good-faith efforts;

(B) When making an adjustment to a previously estimated input under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
