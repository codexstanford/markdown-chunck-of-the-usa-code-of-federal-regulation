() If the mechanical licensing collective receives a notice of dispute from an appropriate copyright owner in compliance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)() of this section, then at or around the point in time that the mechanical licensing collective would otherwise make a particular distribution to that copyright owner but for the digital music provider's reliance on the disputed agreement, the mechanical licensing collective shall deliver an invoice and/or response file to the digital music provider consistent with paragraph (h) of this section that includes the amount that would otherwise be distributed at that time (which shall include the interest that would have accrued on such amount had it been held by the mechanical licensing collective pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(3)(H)(ii) from the original date of transfer) and an explanation of how that amount was determined. Depending on the scope of the notice of dispute, this may include distributions based on matched usage and/or distributions of unclaimed accrued royalties under 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(3)(J). In the case of the latter, the relevant approximate date to deliver the invoice and/or response file to the digital music provider shall be the date on which the mechanical licensing collective provides the notice required under 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(3)(J)(iii)(II)(dd). Where a copyright owner delivers a notice of dispute after the relevant point in time has passed for a particular distribution, the mechanical licensing collective shall deliver the invoice and/or response file to the digital music provider promptly after receiving the notice of dispute. No later than 14 business days after receipt of the invoice and/or response file, the digital music provider must pay the invoiced amount.
