(d) If a reissue application and anreexamination proceeding on which an order pursuant to § 1.525 has been mailed are pending concurrently on a patent, a decision will usually be made to merge the two proceedings or to suspend one of the two proceedings. Where merger of a reissue application and anreexamination proceeding is ordered, the merged examination will be conducted in accordance with §§ 1.171 through 1.179, and the patent owner will be required to place and maintain the same claims in the reissue application and thereexamination proceeding during the pendency of the merged proceeding. The examiner's actions and responses by the patent owner in a merged proceeding will apply to both the reissue application and thereexamination proceeding and will be physically entered into both files. Anyreexamination proceeding merged with a reissue application shall be concluded by the grant of the reissued patent. For merger of a reissue application and anreexamination, see § 1.991.
