(C) Following an audit of a digital music provider that concludes after the cumulative statement of account is delivered and that has the result of affecting the computation of the royalties payable by the digital music provider (as applicable, an audit by a sound recording copyright owner concerning the amount of applicable consideration paid for sound recording copyright rights); or

(D) In response to a change in applicable rates or terms under part 385 of this title.

(E) To ensure consistency with any adjustments made in an Annual Statement of Account generated under ยง 210.7 for the most recent fiscal year.

(l)(1) Subject to the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 115, a digital music provider and the mechanical licensing collective may agree in writing to vary or supplement the procedures described in this section, including but not limited to pursuant to an agreement to administer a voluntary license, provided that any such change does not materially prejudice copyright owners owed royalties required to be transferred to the mechanical licensing collective for the digital music provider to be eligible for the limitation on liability described in 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(10). The procedures surrounding the certification requirements of paragraph (j) of this section may not be altered by agreement. This paragraph (l)(1) does not empower the mechanical licensing collective to agree to alter any substantive requirements described in this section, including but not limited to the required royalty payment and accounting information and sound recording and musical work information.

(2) The mechanical licensing collective shall maintain a current, free, and publicly accessible online list of all agreements made pursuant to paragraph (l)(1) of this section that includes the name of the digital music provider (and, if different, the trade or consumer-facing brand name(s) of the services(s), including any specific offering(s), through which the digital music provider engages, or has engaged at any time during the period identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in covered activities) and the start and end dates of the agreement. Any such agreement shall be considered a record that a copyright owner may access in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(3)(M)(ii). Where an agreement made pursuant to paragraph (l)(1) of this section is made pursuant to an agreement to administer a voluntary license or any other agreement, only those portions that vary or supplement the procedures described in this section and that pertain to the administration of a requesting copyright owner's musical works must be made available to that copyright owner.

(m) Each digital music provider shall, for a period of at least seven years from the date of delivery of a cumulative statement of account or statement of adjustment to the mechanical licensing collective, keep and retain in its possession all records and documents necessary and appropriate to support fully the information set forth in such statement (except that such records and documents that relate to an estimated input permitted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section must be kept and retained for a period of at least seven years from the date of delivery of the statement containing the final adjustment of such input).

(n) Errors in a cumulative statement of account or statement of adjustment that do not materially prejudice the rights of the copyright owner shall be deemed harmless, and shall not render that statement invalid.
