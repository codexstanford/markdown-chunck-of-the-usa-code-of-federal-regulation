##### ยง 355.6 Determinations.
###### Adoption of voluntary agreements.

(d)In lieu of reaching and publishing a determination, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall approve and adopt the amount and terms of an Administrative Assessment that has been negotiated and agreed to by the Mechanical Licensing Collective and the Digital Licensee Coordinator pursuant to ยง 355.4. Notwithstanding the negotiation of an agreed Administrative Assessment, however, the Copyright Royalty Judges may, for good cause shown, reject an agreement. If the Copyright Royalty Judges reject a negotiated agreed Administrative Assessment, they shall proceed with adjudication in accordance with the schedule in place in the proceeding. Rejection by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a negotiated agreed Administrative Assessment shall not prejudice the parties' ability to continue to negotiate and submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges an alternate agreed Administrative Assessment or resubmit an amended prior negotiated agreement that addresses the Judges' reasons for initial rejection at any time, including during a hearing or after a hearing at any time before the Copyright Royalty Judges issue a determination.
