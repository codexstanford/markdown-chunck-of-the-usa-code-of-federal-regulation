(c) Issues other than those indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be resolved in a reexamination proceeding.

(d) Any statement of the patent owner and any accompanying information submitted pursuant to ยง 1.501(a)(2) which is of record in the patent being reexamined (which includes any reexamination files for the patent) may be used after a reexamination proceeding has been ordered to determine the proper meaning of a patent claim when applying patents or printed publications.
