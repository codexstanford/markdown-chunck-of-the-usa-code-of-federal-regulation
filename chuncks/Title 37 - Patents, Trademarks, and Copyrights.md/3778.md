###### Maximum number of proceedings.

(a)The number of Copyright Claims Board proceedings that may be filed by a claimant and the number of proceedings that may be filed by legal counsel or law firms on behalf of claimants in any 12-month period shall be limited in accordance with this section. A proceeding shall count toward the numerical limitation as soon as it is filed, regardless of how the proceeding is resolved, whether it is found to be noncompliant under ยง 224.1 or unsuitable under ยง 224.2 of this subchapter, voluntarily dismissed, or fails to become active due to a respondent's opt-out. Neither amendments to a claim, nor counterclaims filed in response to a claim shall count as additional claims in determining whether the limit has been reached. The following limitations shall apply:

(1) A claimant, including a corporate claimant's parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, shall file no more than 30 proceedings in any 12-month period.

(2) A sole practitioner or a legal counsel associated with a law firm shall file no more than 40 CCB proceedings on behalf of claimants in any 12-month period.

(3) A law firm shall file no more than 80 CCB proceedings on behalf of claimants in any 12-month period.
