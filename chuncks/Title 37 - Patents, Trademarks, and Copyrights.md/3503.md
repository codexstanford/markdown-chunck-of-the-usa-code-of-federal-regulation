###### Amendments.

(f)A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall have a duty to maintain current information in the directory. A corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association may amend a designation of a service agent by following directions on the Board's website. Such amendment shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in 37 CFR 201.3. The requirements found in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply to the service agent designation amendment. If current information is not timely maintained and, as a result, the identification or address of the service agent in the directory is no longer accurate, the Board may, in its discretion and subject to any reasonable conditions that the Board may decide to impose, determine whether service upon that agent or at that address was effective.
