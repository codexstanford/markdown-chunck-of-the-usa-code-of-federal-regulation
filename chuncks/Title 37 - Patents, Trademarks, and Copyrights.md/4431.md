###### Unique Sound Recordings Count

means, for each Licensee, the number of unique sound recordings used and reported per month by such Licensee in Section 115 covered activities, such as would be reflected in the information required to be reported under 17 U.S.C. 115(d), calculated as a monthly average over the respective calculation period, except that a sound recording of a musical work that is in the public domain and designated as such in a monthly report of use shall not count towards the Licensee's Unique Sound Recordings Count. For example, a Licensee's Unique Sound Recordings Count for a Quarterly Allocation calculation period will be calculated by adding together the counts of unique sound recordings reported by such Licensee to the MLC during each month of that quarter and dividing that sum by three. A Licensee's Unique Sound Recordings Count for an Annual Calculation Period will be calculated by adding together the counts of unique sound recordings reported by such Licensee to the MLC during each month of that twelve-month period and dividing that sum by twelve. In the case of a Licensee that was engaged in covered activities only for part of a Quarterly Allocation calculation period or Annual Calculation Period, the monthly average shall be calculated using only the calendar months that the Licensee was engaged in covered activities. In the case of a Licensee that was not engaged in covered activities during any part of a Quarterly Allocation calculation period or Annual Calculation Period, the monthly average shall be zero. Within each month's usage reports from a particular Licensee, a sound recording reported multiple times with the same metadata would be counted as a single sound recording, and a sound recording reported multiple times each with different metadata would be counted multiple times, once for each reporting with new or different metadata.
