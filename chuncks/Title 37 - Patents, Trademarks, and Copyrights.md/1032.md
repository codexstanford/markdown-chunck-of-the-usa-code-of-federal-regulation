####### When to file a statement of use.

(a)(1) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, a statement of use, required under section 1(d) of the Act, must be filed within six months after issuance of a notice of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act, or within an extension of time granted under ยง 2.89. A statement of use filed prior to issuance of a notice of allowance is premature and will not be reviewed.

(2)(i) For a trademark, service mark, collective trademark, collective service mark, and certification mark, a statement of use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce on or in connection with all the goods or services specified in the notice of allowance for which the applicant will seek registration in that application. For a collective membership mark, a statement of use may be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce to indicate membership in the collective membership organization specified in the notice of allowance for which the applicant will seek registration in that application.

(ii) A statement of use may be accompanied by a request in accordance with ยง 2.87 to divide out from the application the goods, services, or classes not yet in use in commerce.
