###### Failure to join a necessary party.

(b)At any time, any party who believes in good faith that a necessary party has not been joined, and therefore the case is unsuitable for Board proceedings, may file a request according to the procedures set forth in §§ 220.5(a)(2) and 224.2(c) of this subchapter. Any party opposing the request may file a response according to the procedures set forth in §§ 220.5(a)(2) and 224.2(c). If the Board determines that a necessary party has not been joined, it shall dismiss the proceeding without prejudice as unsuitable for CCB proceedings pursuant to § 224.2.
