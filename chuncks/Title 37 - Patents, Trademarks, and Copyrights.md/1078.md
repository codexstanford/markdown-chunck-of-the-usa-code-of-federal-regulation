####### Time for filing a request for reconsideration or petition to the Director.

(2)(i) A request for reconsideration must be filed prior to the expiration of time provided for an appeal in § 2.142(a)(2). Filing a request for reconsideration does not stay or extend the time for filing an appeal or a petition under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) Prior to the expiration of time for filing an appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board under § 2.142(a)(2), a registrant may file a petition to the Director under § 2.146 for relief from any outstanding requirement under §§ 2.11, 2.23, and 2.189 made final. If the petition is denied, the registrant will have 3 months from the date of issuance of the final action that contained the final requirement, or 30 days from the date of the decision on the petition, whichever date is later, to comply with the requirement. A requirement that is the subject of a petition decided by the Director may not subsequently be the subject of an appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
