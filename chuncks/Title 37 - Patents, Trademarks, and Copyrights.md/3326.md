###### § 210.30 Temporary exception to certain reporting requirements about certain permanent download licenses.

(a) Where a requirement of § 210.24(b)(8), § 210.25(b)(6), § 210.27(c)(5), or § 210.28(c)(5) has not been satisfied with respect to an individual download license or voluntary pass-through license before April 5, 2021, in connection with a submission to the mechanical licensing collective before such date, a submitter may take additional time to comply with such reporting obligations, as amended, by no later than May 19, 2021. Taking such additional time shall not render an otherwise compliant notice of license, notice of nonblanket activity, or report of usage invalid, or provide a basis for the mechanical licensing collective to reject an otherwise compliant notice of license, serve a notice of default on an otherwise compliant blanket licensee, terminate an otherwise compliant blanket license, or engage in legal enforcement efforts against an otherwise compliant significant nonblanket licensee. Any deadline otherwise applicable to any such action by the mechanical licensing collective shall be tolled with respect to a submitter permitted to take additional time to comply with these reporting obligations until May 19, 2021.
