######## ter,

(e) If any of the requirements of §§ 1.831 through 1.834 are not satisfied at the time of filing an international application under the PCT, where the application is to be searched by the United States International Searching Authority or examined by the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority, the applicant may be sent a notice necessitating compliance with the requirements within a prescribed time period. Under PCT Rule 13the applicant can provide, in response to such a requirement or otherwise, a sequence listing that is a "Sequence Listing XML" in accordance with § 1.831(a). The "Sequence Listing XML" must be accompanied by a statement that the information recorded does not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed. In response to such a requirement, the late furnishing fee set forth in § 1.445(a)(5) is also required. If the applicant fails to timely provide the required "Sequence Listing XML," the United States International Searching Authority shall search only to the extent that a meaningful search can be performed without the "Sequence Listing XML," and the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority shall examine only to the extent that a meaningful examination can be performed without the "Sequence Listing XML."
