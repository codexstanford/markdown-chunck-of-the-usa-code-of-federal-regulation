####### Reasonable investigation of nonuse.

(d)A petitioner must make a bona fide attempt to determine if the registered mark was not in use in commerce or never in use in commerce on or in connection with the goods and/or services specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section by conducting a reasonable investigation.

(1) A reasonable investigation is an appropriately comprehensive search, which may vary depending on the circumstances but is calculated to return information about the underlying inquiry from reasonably accessible sources where evidence concerning use of the mark during the relevant time period on or in connection with the relevant goods and/or services would normally be found.

(2) Sources for a reasonable investigation may include, but are not limited to:

(i) State and Federal trademark records;

(ii) internet websites and other media likely to or believed to be owned or controlled by the registrant;

(iii) internet websites, other online media, and publications where the relevant goods and/or services likely would be advertised or offered for sale;

(iv) Print sources and web pages likely to contain reviews or discussion of the relevant goods and/or services;

(v) Records of filings made with or of actions taken by any State or Federal business registration or regulatory agency;

(vi) The registrant's marketplace activities, including, for example, any attempts to contact the registrant or purchase the relevant goods and/or services;

(vii) Records of litigation or administrative proceedings reasonably likely to contain evidence bearing on the registrant's use or nonuse of the registered mark; and

(viii) Any other reasonably accessible source with information establishing nonuse of the mark as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(3) A petitioner need not check all possible appropriate sources for its investigation to be considered reasonable.
