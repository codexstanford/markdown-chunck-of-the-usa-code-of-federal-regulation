In the case of a formerly listed region removed due to an outbreak, the region may be returned to the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in ยง 92.4 of this subchapter. APHIS will remove a region from the list of those it has declared free of classical scrapie upon determining classical scrapie exists there based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease in sheep or goats from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable, or upon determining that the region's animal health infrastructure, regulations, or policy no longer qualifies the region for such status.
