(1) If the herd is identified as the source of captive cervids having lesions of tuberculosis andhas been confirmed by bacterial isolation from the slaughter animal, all captive cervids in the herd that respond to the SCT must be classified as reactors. All captive cervids in the herd that respond to the DPP&#xAE; test must be classified as reactors. If none respond to the SCT test or have non-negative test results to the DPP&#xAE; test, the herd may be released from quarantine and will return to the herd classification status in effect before the herd was quarantined, unless APHIS determines that additional testing is appropriate to ensure the herd's freedom from tuberculosis.
