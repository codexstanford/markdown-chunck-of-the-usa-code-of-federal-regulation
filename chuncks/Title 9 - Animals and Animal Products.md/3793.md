(4) Each of 20 vaccinated mice per group shall be challenged intraperitoneally 7 to 10 days after the second vaccination with a 0.25 ml dose containing 1,000-100,000 mouse LDas determined by titration of a suitable culture ofAll survivors in each group of mice shall be recorded 14 days postchallenge.

(5) Test for valid assay: At least two dilutions of the Standard shall protect more than 0 percent and two dilutions shall protect less than 100 percent of the mice injected. The lowest dilution of the Standard shall protect more than 50 percent of the mice. The highest dilution of the Standard shall protect less than 50 percent of the mice.

(6) The relative potency (RP) of the Unknown is determined by comparing the 50 percent endpoint dilution (highest bacterin dilution protecting 50 percent of the mice) of the Unknown with that of the Standard by the following formula:

(7) If the RP of the Unknown is less than 0.30, the serial being tested is unsatisfactory.
