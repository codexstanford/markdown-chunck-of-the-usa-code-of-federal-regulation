##### ยง 85.1 Definitions.
###### Qualified pseudorabies negative herd.

(a) Qualified pseudorabies negative herd status is attained by subjecting all swine over 6 months of age to an official pseudorabies serologic test and finding all swine so tested negative. The herd must not have been a known infected herd within the past 30 days. A minimum of 90 percent of the swine in the herd must have been on the premises and a part of the herd for at least 90 days prior to the qualifying official pseudorabies serologic test or have entered directly from another qualified pseudorabies negative herd.

(b)(1) If on a qualifying official pseudorabies serologic test or any subsequent official pseudorabies test, any swine so tested are positive, qualified pseudorabies negative herd status is attained or regained by: Removing all positive swine and cleaning and disinfecting the herd premises in accordance with ยง 85.13; subjecting all swine in the herd, except swine nursing from their mothers, to an official pseudorabies serologic test 30 days or more after removal of the positive swine and finding all swine so tested negative; and, after an interval of 30 to 60 days after the first such negative official pseudorabies serologic herd test, subjecting all swine in the herd over 6 months of age to another official pseudorabies serologic test and finding all swine so tested negative; or

(2) If on any qualifying official pseudorabies serologic test or any subsequent official pseudorabies serologic test, any swine so tested are positive, but no swine are positive at titers greater than 1:8, qualified pseudorabies negative herd status is attained or regained by: Subjecting all titered swine and all other swine required to be tested by an epidemiologist, approved by the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in Charge, to an official pseudorabies serologic test and finding all such swine negative.

(c) Qualified pseudorabies negative herd status is maintained by subjecting all swine over 6 months of age in the herd to an official pseudorabies serologic test at least once each year (this must be accomplished by testing 25 percent of swine over 6 months of age every 80-105 days and finding all swine so tested negative, or by testing 10 percent of the swine over 6 months of age each month and finding all swine so tested negative; no swine shall be tested twice in 1 year to comply with the 25 percent requirement or twice in 10 months to comply with the 10 percent requirement). All swine intended to be added to a qualified pseudorabies negative herd shall be isolated until the swine have been found negative to two official pseudorabies serologic tests, one conducted 30 days or more after the swine have been placed in isolation, the second test being conducted 30 days or more after the first test; except (1) swine intended to be added to a qualified pseudorabies negative herd directly from another qualified pseudorabies negative herd may be added without isolation or testing; (2) swine intended to be added to a qualified pseudorabies negative herd from another qualified pseudorabies negative herd, but with interim contact with swine other than those from a single qualified pseudorabies negative herd, shall be isolated until the swine have been found negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test, conducted 30 days or more after the swine have been placed in isolation; (3) swine returned to the herd after contact with swine other than those from a single qualified pseudorabies negative herd shall be isolated until the swine have been found negative to an official pseudorabies serologic test conducted 30 days or more after the swine have been placed in isolation.
