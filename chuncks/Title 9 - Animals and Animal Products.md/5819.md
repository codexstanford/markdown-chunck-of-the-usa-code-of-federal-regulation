###### § 317.362 Nutrient content claims for fat, fatty acids, and cholesterol content.
####### Fat content claims.

(b)(1) The terms "fat free," "free of fat," "no fat," "zero fat," "without fat," "nonfat," "trivial source of fat," "negligible source of fat," or "dietarily insignificant source of fat" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, provided that:

(i) The product contains less than 0.5 gram (g) of fat per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of fat per labeled serving size;

(ii) The product contains no added ingredient that is a fat or is generally understood by consumers to contain fat unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: "Adds a trivial amount of fat," "adds a negligible amount of fat," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of fat"; and

(iii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(2) The terms "low fat," "low in fat," "contains a small amount of fat," "low source of fat," or "little fat" may be used on the label and in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i)(A) The product has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 g or greater than 2 tablespoons (tbsp) and contains 3 g or less of fat per reference amount customarily consumed; or

(B) The product has a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tbsp or less and contains 3 g or less of fat per reference amount customarily consumed and per 50 g (for dehydrated products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 317.309(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per-50-g criterion refers to the "as prepared" form).

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(3) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains 3 g or less of total fat per 100 g of product and not more than 30 percent of calories from fat; and

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower the fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(4) The terms "reduced fat," "reduced in fat," "fat reduced," "less fat," "lower fat," or "lower in fat" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less fat per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the fat differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced fat-50 percent less fat than our regular 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of fat in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "fat content has been reduced from 8 g to 4 g per serving").

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low fat."

(5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less fat per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the fat differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced fat 'product', 33 percent less fat per 3 oz than our regular 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of fat in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent such claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "fat content has been reduced from 8 g per 3 oz to 5 g per 3 oz").

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low fat."

(6) The term "______ percent fat free" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, provided that:

(i) The product meets the criteria for "low fat" in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section;

(ii) The percent declared and the words "fat free" are in uniform type size; and

(iii) A "100 percent fat free" claim may be made only on products that meet the criteria for "fat free" in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that contain less than 0.5 g of fat per 100 g, and that contain no added fat.

(iv) A synonym for "______ percent fat free" is "______ percent lean."
