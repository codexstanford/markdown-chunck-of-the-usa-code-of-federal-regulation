###### § 317.360 Nutrient content claims for calorie content.
####### Sugar content claims.

(c)(1) Terms such as "sugar free," "free of sugar," "no sugar," "zero sugar," "without sugar," "sugarless," "trivial source of sugar," "negligible source of sugar," or "dietarily insignificant source of sugar" may reasonably be expected to be regarded by consumers as terms that represent that the product contains no sugars or sweeteners, e.g., "sugar free," or "no sugar," as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:

(i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;

(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: "Adds a trivial amount of sugar," "adds a negligible amount of sugar," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;" and

(iii)(A) It is labeled "low calorie" or "reduced calorie" or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or

(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement "not a reduced calorie product," "not a low calorie product," or "not for weight control."

(2) The terms "no added sugar," "without added sugar," or "no sugar added" may be used only if:

(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;

(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;

(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;

(iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and

(v) The product bears a statement that the product is not "low calorie" or "calorie reduced" (unless the product meets the requirements for a "low" or "reduced calorie" product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.

(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.

(4) The terms "reduced sugar," "reduced in sugar," "sugar reduced," "less sugar," "lower sugar," or "lower in sugar" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product"); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving").

(5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced sugar 'product'-25% less sugar than our regular 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz").
