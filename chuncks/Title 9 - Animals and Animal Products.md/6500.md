####### Facilities for ante mortem inspection.

(b)A suspect pen is required for adequate ratite inspection.

(c) Facilities for the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS). The following requirements for lines operating under SIS are in addition to the normal requirements to obtain a grant of inspection. The requirements for SIS in § 381.76(b) also apply.

(1) The following provisions shall apply to every inspection station:

(i) The conveyor line shall be level for the entire length of the inspection station. The vertical distance from the bottom of the shackles to the top of the adjustable platform (paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section) in its lowest position shall not be less than 60 inches.

(ii) Floor space shall consist of 4 feet along the conveyor line for the inspector, and 4 feet for the establishment helper. A total of at least 8 feet along the conveyor line shall be supplied for one inspection station and 16 feet for two-inspection stations.

(iii) Selectors or "kickouts" shall be installed in establishments with two inspection stations on a line so each inspector will receive birds on 12-inch centers with no intervening birds to impede inspection. The selector must move the bird to the edge of the trough for the inspector and establishment helper. The selectors must be smooth, steady, and consistent in moving the birds parallel and through the inspection station. Birds shall be selected and released smoothly to avoid swinging when entering the inspection station.

(iv) Each inspector's station shall have a platform that is slip-resistant and can be safely accessed by the inspector. The platform shall be designed so that it can be easily and rapidly adjusted for a minimum of 14 inches vertically while standing on the platform. The platform shall be a minimum length of 4 feet and have a minimum width of 2 feet; the platform shall be designed with a 42-inch high rail on the back side and with-inch foot bumpers on both sides and front to allow safe working conditions. The platform must have a safe lift mechanism and be large enough for the inspector to sit on a stool and to change stations during breaks or station rotation.

(v) Conveyor line stop/start switches shall be located within easy reach of each inspector.

(vi) A trough or other facilities shall extend beneath the conveyor at all places where processing operations are conducted from the point where the carcass is opened to the point where the trimming has been performed. The trough must be of sufficient width to preclude trimmings, drippage, and debris from accumulating on the floor or platforms. The clearance between the suspended carcasses and the trough must be sufficient to preclude contamination of carcasses by splash.

(vii) A minimum of 200-footcandles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index value of 85 where the birds are inspected to facilitate inspection.

(viii) Online handrinsing facilities with a continuous flow of water must be provided for and within easy reach of each inspector and each establishment helper. The hand-contact element must be rinsed automatically with a sufficient volume of water to remove all fat, tissue, debris, and other extraneous material from the hand contact element after each use. Both hot and cold running water shall be available at each inspection station on the eviscerating line and shall be delivered through a suitable mixing device controlled by the inspector. Alternatively, water for hand washing shall be delivered to such inspection stations at a minimum temperature of 65 degrees F.

(ix) Hangback racks shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of the establishment helpers.

(x) Each inspection station shall be provided with receptacles for condemned carcasses and parts. Such receptacles shall comply with the performance standards in § 416.3(c) of this chapter.

(2) The following provisions shall apply only to prechill and postchill reinspection stations:

(i) Floor space shall consist of a minimum of 3 feet along each conveyor line and after each chiller to allow carcasses to be removed for evaluation. The space shall be level and protected from all traffic and overhead obstructions.

(ii) The vertical distance from the bottom of the shackles to the floor shall not be less than 48 inches.

(iii) A table, at least 2 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and 3 feet high designed to be readily cleanable and drainable shall be provided for reinspecting the sampled birds.

(iv) A minimum of 200-footcandles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index of 85 on the table surface shall be provided.

(vii) Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of the person at the station.

(d) Facilities for the New Line Speed (NELS) inspection system. The following requirements for lines operating under the NELS inspection system are in addition to the normal requirements to obtain a grant of inspection and to the requirements for NELS in § 381.76 (b) and (c).

(iii) Selectors or "kickouts" shall be installed so the three inspection stations will receive birds on 18-inch centers with no intervening birds to impede inspection. The selector must move the bird to the end of the trough for the presenter, inspector, and establishment helper. The selectors must be smooth, steady, and consistent in moving the birds parallel and through the inspection station.

Guide bars shall not extend in front of the inspection station mirror to avoid obstructing the inspector's view.

(iv) Each inspector's station shall have an easily and rapidly adjustable platform, with a minimum of 14 inches of vertical adjustment, which covers the entire length of the station (4 feet) and has a minimum width of 2 feet.
