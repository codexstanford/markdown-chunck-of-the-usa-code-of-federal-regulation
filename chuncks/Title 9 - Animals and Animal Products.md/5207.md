###### Use.

(i)If a written hearing is held, a transcript or recording, of a deposition ordered and taken in accord with this section, may be made a part of the record as evidence by any party, by written motion filed with such party's evidence. If an oral hearing is held, except as otherwise provided in these rules, such a transcript or recording may be made a part of the record as evidence, on written motion filed by any party, or oral motion of any party made at the oral hearing, if no party objects after reasonable notice and opportunity to do so, or if the presiding officer finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and:

(1) That the witness is dead;

(2) That the witness is unable to attend or testify for any good reason including age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;

(3) That the party offering the transcript or recording has tried without success to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or

(4) That such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony orally before the presiding officer, to allow the transcript or recording to be used.
