###### Mercury-in-glass thermometers.

(i)A mercury-in-glass thermometer must have divisions that are readable to 1 &#xB0;F (or 0.5 &#xB0;C) and whose scale contains not more than 17 &#xB0;F/inch (or 4.0 &#xB0;C/cm) of graduated scale. Each mercury-in-glass thermometer must be tested for accuracy against a known accurate standard upon installation and at least once a year to ensure its accuracy. Records that specify the date, standard used, test method, and the person or testing authority performing the test must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees. A mercury-in-glass thermometer that has a divided mercury column or that cannot be adjusted to the standard must be repaired and tested for accuracy before further use, or replaced.
