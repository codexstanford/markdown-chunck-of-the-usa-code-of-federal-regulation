(3)Iberian hams were processed as follows (365-day minimum curing process):

(i) If the ham is received frozen, it was thawed in a chamber with relative humidity between 70 and 80 percent, with room temperature maintained at 5.5 &#xB0;C to 6.5 &#xB0;C (41.9 &#xB0;F to 43.7 &#xB0;F) for the first 24 hours, then at 9.5 &#xB0;C to 10.5 &#xB0;C (49.1 &#xB0;F to 50.9 &#xB0;F) until the internal temperature of the ham reached 3 &#xB0;C to 4 &#xB0;C (37.4 &#xB0;F to 39.2 &#xB0;F), at which point the blood vessels at the end of the femur were massaged to remove any remaining blood.

(ii) The ham was covered in salt and placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature from 0 &#xB0;C to 4 &#xB0;C (32 &#xB0;F to 39.2 &#xB0;F), with relative humidity between 75 and 95 percent, and kept in the chamber for a period no less than 0.65 days per kg and no more than 2 days per kg of the weight of the ham;

(iii) The ham was rinsed with water and/or brushed to remove any remaining surface salt.

(iv) The ham was placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 &#xB0;C to 6 &#xB0;C (32 &#xB0;F to 42.8 &#xB0;F), with relative humidity of 70 to 95 percent, for no less than 40 and no more than 60 days.

(v) The ham was placed for curing in a chamber with a temperature of 6 &#xB0;C to 16 &#xB0;C (42.8 &#xB0;F to 60.8 &#xB0;F) and relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent for a minimum of 90 days.

(vi) The temperature was raised to 16 &#xB0;C to 26 &#xB0;C (60.8 &#xB0;F to 78.8 &#xB0;F) and the relative humidity reduced to 55 to 85 percent, for a minimum of 90 days.
