##### ยง 79.2 Identification and records requirements for sheep and goats in interstate commerce.
###### Persons handling sheep and goats in commerce.

(3)Sets of unique individual identification serial numbers may be assigned to persons who handle sheep and goats, that did not originate in a breeding flock owned by them, if they apply to and are approved by the State Animal Health Official or the Veterinary Services, Field Operations, AVIC responsible for the State in which the person maintains his or her business location, whichever is responsible for issuing official identification devices or numbers in that State and for assigning flock identification numbers and premises identification numbers in that State in the National Scrapie Database. When requested by APHIS, persons who apply official identification to sheep or goats that did not originate in a breeding flock owned by them must provide, in a manner acceptable to APHIS, assignment data associating assigned serial sequences to the flock of origin and, when required, the flock of birth. One such method would be to enter the data into the National Scrapie Database. The request may be made directly to a person or persons or to a class of persons through amendment of the Scrapie Program Standards Volume 1: National Scrapie Eradication Program. The State Animal Health Official or the Administrator may limit the assignment of official identification devices or numbers to persons, or classes of persons, for use on animals that did not originate in a breeding flock owned by them to slaughter only devices or numbers.
