####### Newcastle disease.

Newcastle disease (ND) is defined as an infection of poultry caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which is an avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) that meets one of the following criteria for virulence:

(1) The virus has an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks (Gallusgallus) of 0.7 or greater; or

(2) Multiple basic amino acids have been demonstrated in the virus (either directly or by deduction) at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and phenylalanine at residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F1 protein. The term 'multiple basic amino acids' refers to at least three arginine or lysine residues between residues 113 and 116. Failure to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as described in the preceding sentences would require characterization of the isolated virus by an ICPI test.
