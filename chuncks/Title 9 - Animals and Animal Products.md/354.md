Nonhuman primates used in trained animal acts or in uncaged public exhibits must be under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is present. Trained nonhuman primates may be permitted physical contact with the public, as allowed under ยง 2.131, but only if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times during the contact.
