###### Livestock.

(b)When livestock is weighed for the purpose of purchase or sale, or when livestock is purchased on a carcass weight or carcass grade and weight basis, the live or hot carcass weights must be recorded using a scale equipped with a printing device, and such printed weights must be retained as part of the person or firm's business records to substantiate settlement on each transaction. In instances where the weight values are automatically recorded directly on the account of purchase, account of sale, or other basic transaction record, this record may serve in place of a scale ticket. Scale tickets or other basic transaction records issued under this section must show:

(1) The name and location of the agency performing the weighing service;

(2) The date of the weighing;

(3) The name of the buyer and seller or consignor, or a designation by which they may be readily identified;

(4) The number of head;

(5) Kind of livestock;

(6) Actual weight of each draft of livestock; and

(7) The name, initials, or identification number of the person who weighed the livestock, or if required by State law, the signature of the weigher, except for an automated weighing system where a weigher is not stationed at the scale.
