() The product contains 2 g or less of saturated fat per reference amount customarily consumed.

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches; or

(iii) If the product contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol only as a result of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation, the amount of cholesterol is reduced by 25 percent or more from the reference product it replaces as described in § 317.313(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as described in § 317.313(d) that has a significant (e.g., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share. As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the cholesterol has been reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "low cholesterol 'product', contains 85 percent less cholesterol than our regular 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "cholesterol lowered from 30 mg to 5 mg per serving").

(3) The terms defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains 20 mg or less of cholesterol per 100 g of product;

(ii) The product contains 2 g or less of saturated fat per 100 g of product; and

(iii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(4) The terms "reduced cholesterol," "reduced in cholesterol," "cholesterol reduced," "less cholesterol," "lower cholesterol," or "lower in cholesterol" may be used on the label or in labeling of products or products that substitute for those products as specified in § 317.313(d), excluding meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product has been specifically formulated, altered, or processed to reduce its cholesterol by 25 percent or more from the reference product it replaces as described in § 317.313(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as described in § 317.313(d) that has a significant (e.g., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share;

(ii) The product contains 2 g or less of saturated fat per reference amount customarily consumed; and

(iii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the cholesterol has been reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "25 percent less cholesterol than 'reference product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "cholesterol lowered from 55 mg to 30 mg per serving").

(iv) Claims described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low cholesterol."

(5) The terms defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i) The product has been specifically formulated, altered, or processed to reduce its cholesterol by 25 percent or more from the reference product it replaces as described in § 317.313(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as described in § 317.313(d) that has a significant (e.g., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share;

(ii) The product contains 2 g or less of saturated fat per 100 g of product; and

(iii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the cholesterol has been reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "25% less cholesterol than 'reference product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "cholesterol content has been reduced from 35 mg per 3 oz to 25 mg per 3 oz).

(iv) Claims described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low cholesterol."
