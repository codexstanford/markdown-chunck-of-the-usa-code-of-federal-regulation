When any chemical, preservative, cereal, spice, or other substance is intended for use in an official establishment, it shall be examined by a Program employee and if found to be unfit or otherwise unacceptable for the use intended, or if final decision regarding acceptance is deferred pending laboratory or other examination, the employee shall attach a "U.S. retained" tag to the substance or container thereof.
