#### PART 151 - RECOGNITION OF BREEDS AND BOOKS OF RECORD OF PUREBRED ANIMALS
##### Recognition of Breeds and Books of Record
###### ยง 151.9 Recognized breeds and books of record.

Breeds of animals and books of record listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) are hereby recognized. Recognition of such breeds and books of record will be continued, however, only if the books of record involved are kept by the custodians thereof in a form which is reasonably current and the book otherwise meets the requirements of this part, in the opinion of the Administrator. When a registry association which publishes a book of record that was recognized in printed form ceases to publish the book in such form and in lieu thereof publishes the book in microfilm form, the recognition of such book of record will be continued only if the book meets the requirements of this part. A copy of each printed volume and microfilm record of a book of record published after the book is recognized under this part shall be sent to APHIS immediately following such publication. All books of record sent to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, shall be submitted through the Veterinary Services, Operational Support, 4700 River Road, Unit 33, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.
