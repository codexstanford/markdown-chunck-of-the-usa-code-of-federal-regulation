###### Serrano hams.

(2)Serrano hams were processed as follows (190-day minimum curing process):

(i) If the ham is received frozen, it was thawed in a chamber with relative humidity between 70 and 80 percent, with room temperature maintained at 12 &#xB0;C to 13 &#xB0;C (53.6 &#xB0;F to 55.4 &#xB0;F) for the first 24 hours, then at 13 &#xB0;C to 14 &#xB0;C (55.4 &#xB0;F to 57.2 &#xB0;F) until the internal temperature of the ham reached 3 &#xB0;C to 4 &#xB0;C (37.4 &#xB0;F to 39.2 &#xB0;F), at which point the blood vessels at the end of the femur were massaged to remove any remaining blood.

(ii) The ham was covered in salt and placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature from 0 &#xB0;C to 4 &#xB0;C (32 &#xB0;F to 39.2 &#xB0;F), with relative humidity between 75 and 95 percent, for a period no less than 0.65 days per kg and no more than 2 days per kg of the weight of the ham.

(iii) The ham was rinsed with water and/or brushed to remove any remaining surface salt.

(iv) The ham was placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 &#xB0;C to 6 &#xB0;C (32 &#xB0;F to 42.8 &#xB0;F), with a relative humidity of 70 to 95 percent, for no less than 40 and no more than 60 days;

(v) The ham was placed for curing in a chamber with a relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent and a temperature gradually raised in 3 phases, as follows:

(A) A temperature of 6 &#xB0;C to 16 &#xB0;C (42.8 &#xB0;F to 60.8 &#xB0;F), maintained for a minimum of 45 days;

(B) A temperature of 16 &#xB0;C to 24 &#xB0;C (60.8 &#xB0;F to 75.2 &#xB0;F), maintained for a minimum of 35 days;

(C) A temperature of 24 &#xB0;C to 34 &#xB0;C (75.2 &#xB0;F to 93.2 &#xB0;F), maintained for a minimum of 30 days;
