######## Pool volume.

(3)A pool of water housing cetaceans which satisfies the MHD and which meets the minimum depth requirement, will have sufficient volume and surface area to hold up to two Group I cetaceans or up to four Group II cetaceans. If additional cetaceans are to be added to the pool, the volume as well as the surface area may have to be adjusted to allow for additional space necessary for such cetaceans. See Tables I, II, and IV for volumes and surface area requirements. The additional volume needed shall be based on the number and kind of cetaceans housed therein and shall be determined in the following manner.

(i) The minimum volume of water required for up to two Group I cetaceans is based upon the following formula:

(ii) The minimum volume of water required for up to four Group II cetaceans is based upon the following formula:

(iii) When a mixture of both Group I and Group II cetaceans are housed together, the MHD must be satisfied as stated in ยง 3.104(b)(1), and the minimum depth must be satisfied as stated in ยง 3.104(b)(2). Based on these figures, the resulting volume must then be calculated
