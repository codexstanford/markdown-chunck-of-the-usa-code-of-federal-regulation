(a) The carcasses of all hogs affected with hog cholera shall be condemned.

(b) Inconclusive but suspicious symptoms of hog cholera observed during the ante-mortem inspection of a U.S. suspect shall be duly considered in connection with post-mortem findings and when the carcass of such a suspect shows lesions in the kidneys and the lymph nodes which resemble lesions of hog cholera, they shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned.

(c) When lesions resembling those of hog cholera occur in kidneys and lymph nodes of carcasses of hogs which appeared normal on ante-mortem inspection, further inspection of such carcasses shall be made for corroborative lesions. If on such further inspection, characteristic lesions of hog cholera are found in some organ or tissue in addition to those in the kidneys or in the lymph nodes or in both, then all lesions shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned. Immediate notification shall be given by the inspector to the official in the Veterinary Services unit of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who has responsibility for control of swine diseases in the State where the swine are located.
