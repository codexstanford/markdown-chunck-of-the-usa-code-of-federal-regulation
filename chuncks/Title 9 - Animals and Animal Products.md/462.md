####### ยง 3.113 Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals.

No dealer, research facility, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale shall offer for transportation or transport, in commerce, any marine mammal in a primary enclosure that does not conform to the following requirements:

(a) Primary enclosures that are used to transport marine mammals other than cetaceans and sirenians must:

(1) Be constructed from materials of sufficient structural strength to contain the marine mammals;

(2) Be constructed from material that is durable, nontoxic, and cannot be chewed and/or swallowed;

(3) Be able to withstand the normal rigors of transportation;

(4) Have interiors that are free from any protrusions or hazardous openings that could be injurious to the marine mammals contained within;

(5) Be constructed so that no parts of the contained marine mammals are exposed to the outside of the enclosures in any way that may cause injury to the animals or to persons who are nearby or who handle the enclosures;

(6) Have openings that provide access into the enclosures and are secured with locking devices of a type that cannot be accidentally opened;

(7) Have such openings located in a manner that makes them easily accessible at all times for emergency removal and potential treatment of any live marine mammal contained within;

(8) Have air inlets at heights that will provide cross ventilation at all levels (particularly when the marine mammals are in a prone position), are located on all four sides of the enclosures, and cover not less than 20 percent of the total surface area of each side of the enclosures;

(9) Have projecting rims or other devices placed on any ends and sides of the enclosures that have ventilation openings so that there is a minimum air circulation space of 7.6 centimeters (3.0 inches) between the enclosures and any adjacent cargo or conveyance wall;

(10) Be constructed so as to provide sufficient air circulation space to maintain the temperature limits set forth in this subpart; and

(11) Be equipped with adequate handholds or other devices on the exterior of the enclosures to enable them to be lifted without unnecessary tilting and to ensure that the persons handling the enclosures will not come in contact with any marine mammal contained inside.

(b) Straps, slings, harnesses, or other devices used for body support or restraint, when transporting marine mammals such as cetaceans and sirenians must:

(1) Be designed so as not to prevent access to the marine mammals by attendants for the purpose of administering in-transit care;

(2) Be equipped with special padding to prevent trauma or injury at critical weight pressure points on the body of the marine mammals; and

(3) Be capable of keeping the animals from thrashing about and causing injury to themselves or their attendants, and yet be adequately designed so as not to cause injury to the animals.

(c) Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals must be large enough to assure that:

(1) In the case of pinnipeds, polar bears, and sea otters, each animal has sufficient space to turn about freely in a stance whereby all four feet or flippers are on the floor and the animal can sit in an upright position and lie in a natural position;
