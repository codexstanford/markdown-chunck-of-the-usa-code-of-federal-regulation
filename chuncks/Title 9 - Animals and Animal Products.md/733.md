####### Eligibility for indemnity.

(1)Owners of the following types of animals destroyed because of brucellosis are eligible to receive Federal indemnity for their animals:

(i) Cattle and bison identified as reactors as a result of a complete herd test and any sexually intact exposed female calves;

(ii) Cattle and bison in a herd that has been approved for depopulation; and

(iii) Brucellosis-exposed cattle and brucellosis-exposed bison that were previously sold or traded from any herd that was, subsequent to the sale or trade, found to be affected with brucellosis. Epidemiological information such as test results, herd history, and related evidence will be used to establish a probable date when the herd was first affected with brucellosis. Animals sold after that date will be considered to be exposed; those sold before that date will not.
