###### ยง 381.91 Contamination.

(a) Carcasses of poultry contaminated by volatile oils, paints, poisons, gases, scald vat water in the air sac system, or other substances which render the carcasses adulterated shall be condemned. Any organ or other part of a carcass which has been accidentally multilated in the course of processing shall be condemned, and if the whole carcass is affected, the whole carcass shall be condemned.

(b) Any carcass of poultry accidentally contaminated during slaughter with digestive tract contents need not be condemned if promptly reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and thereafter found not to be adulterated. Contaminated surfaces that are cut must be removed only by trimming. Contaminated inner surfaces that are not cut may be cleaned by trimming alone or may be re-processed as provided in subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
