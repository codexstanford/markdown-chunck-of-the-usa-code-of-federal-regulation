####### c,Provided,,Provided further,

() For purposes of this paragraph, operations conducted as a restaurant central kitchen facility shall be considered as being conducted at a restaurant if the restaurant central kitchen prepares poultry products that are ready to eat when they leave such facility (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to a receiving restaurant by its own employees, without intervening transfer or storage, maintained in a safe, unadulterated condition during transportation, and served in meals or as entrees only to customers at restaurants, or through vending machines, owned or operated by the same person that owns or operates such facility, and which otherwise meets the requirement of this paragraph:That the requirements of §§ 381.175 through 381.178 of this subchapter apply to such facility.That the exempted facility may be subject to inspection requirements under the Act for as long as the Administrator deems necessary if the Administrator determines that the sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the processing procedures or methods at the facility are such that any of its poultry products are rendered adulterated. When the Administrator has made such determination and subjected a restaurant central kitchen facility to such inspection requirements, the operator of such facility shall be afforded an opportunity to dispute the Administrator's determination in a hearing pursuant to rules of practice which will be adopted for this proceeding.

(v) A similar retail-type establishment is any establishment which is a combination retail store and restaurant; any delicatessen which meets the requirements for a retail store or restaurant as prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section; or other establishment as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

(vi) A consumer is any household consumer, hotel, or restaurant, or similar institution as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.

(3) Whenever any complaint is received by the Administrator from any person alleging that any retail establishment or restaurant claiming exemption under this paragraph (d) in any designated State or organized territory listed in § 381.221 that is also identified in § 381.224 as a jurisdiction that does not have or is not exercising adequate authority with respect to recordkeeping requirements, has been operated in violation of the conditions prescribed in this paragraph (d) for such exemption, and the Administrator, upon investigation of the complaint, has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred, he shall so notify the operator of the retail establishment or restaurant and afford him reasonable opportunity to present his views informally with respect to the matter. Thereafter, if the Administrator determines that such a violation has occurred, and that a requirement that the operator keep records concerning the operations of the retail establishment or restaurant would effectuate the purposes of the Act, the Administrator shall order the operator to maintain complete, accurate, and legible records of his total monthly purchases and of his total monthly sales of poultry and poultry products. Such records shall separately show total sales to household consumers and total sales to other consumers, and shall be maintained for the period prescribed in § 381.177. If the operator maintains copies of bills of lading, receiving and shipping invoices, warehouse receipts, or similar documents which give the information required herein, additional records are not required by this subparagraph.

(4) The adulteration and misbranding provisions of the Act and the regulations other than the requirement of the official inspection legend, apply to articles which are exempted from inspection under this paragraph (d).

(e)(1) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to poultry pizzas containing poultry product ingredients which were prepared, inspected, and passed in a cured or cooked form as ready-to-eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed) in compliance with the requirements of the Act and these regulations; and the poultry pizzas are to be served in public or private nonprofit institutions, provided that the poultry pizzas are ready to eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to the receiving institution by employees of the preparing firm, receiving institution, or a food service management company contracted to conduct food service at the public or private nonprofit institution, without intervening transfer or storage.
