### Subchapter A - Agency Organization and Terminology; Mandatory Meat and Poultry Products Inspection and Voluntary Inspection and Certification
#### PART 325 - TRANSPORTATION
##### § 325.11 Inedible articles: denaturing and other means of identification; exceptions.
###### Provided,

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisons of paragraph (i) of this paragraph (d)(3), the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains livestock-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., "Horsemeat for Pets" or "Beef Stew for Dogs":That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass, but shall not be less thaninches high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.

(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of livestock carcass-source material contrast with their background.

(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feeds manufactured from processed livestock byproducts (such as meat meal tankage, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and feed grade animal fat), or to processed dry animal food.

(e) Except for inedible rendered animal fats and lungs or lung lobes, inedible products (including condemned products only if condemned for causes specified in § 314.11 of this subchapter) which were prepared at any official establishment, or at any State inspected establishment in any State not listed in § 331.2 of this subchapter, and which have the physical characteristics of a product fit for human food, may be transported from an official establishment or in commerce, without denaturing as required by this subchapter, if the following conditions are met:

(1) The shipper must have obtained a numbered permit for such activity from the appropriate Regional Director, as identified in § 301.2 of this subchapter. Such permit may be obtained upon written application to the appropriate Regional Director and his determination that the proposed transportation would be authorized under this paragraph (e). The application shall state the name and address of the applicant, a description of the type of his business operations, and the purpose of making such application.

(2) Such inedible products may be transported under this paragraph (e) only if consigned to a manufacturer in the United States of articles other than for human food and if the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing articles not for human food. Such products may not be transported in commerce to any consignee other than the one to which they were originally shipped unless prior notice of the diversion is given to the appropriate Regional Director and a record identifying the new consignee is maintained by the shipper as required by § 320.1 of this subchapter.

(3) When transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e), the outside container of such inedible products shall be marked conspicuously with the words "Inedible-Not Intended for Human Food" in letters not less than 2 inches high, in the case of containers, such as cartons, drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks used to transport such products not in other containers.

(4) Such inedible products shall be transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e) only in railroad cars, trucks, or containers which bear unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned to the permit holder and an individual seal serial number assigned by the shipper; and the product so transported shall be accompanied by an invoice or bill of lading specifying the permit holder's identification number. The consignee in the United States must retain a record of the identification and serial numbers shown on the seals in his records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.

(5) Any diversion, or effort to divert, undenatured, inedible product contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (e) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of inedible products under this paragraph (e), at the discretion of the Administrator.
