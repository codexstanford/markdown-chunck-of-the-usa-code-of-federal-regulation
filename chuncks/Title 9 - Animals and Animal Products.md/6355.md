###### Procedure.

(2)An application or request for service may be rejected, or benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to or withdrawn by the Secretary, as provided by this paragraph, after notice and opportunity for hearing before a proper official of the Department. The Administrator may reject an application or request for service or deny or withdraw service under this paragraph without hearing, pending final determination of the matter, when he determines that the public interest so requires. The operator or applicant of such plant shall be notified of the Administrator's decision to reject the application or request for service or to deny or withdraw such service, and the reasons therefor, in writing, in the manner prescribed in ยง 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally. The Administrator's decision to reject an application or request for service or to deny or withdraw the benefits of service under the Act shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator or applicant of such plant. If such notification is oral, the Administrator shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the operator or applicant of such plant in the manner prescribed in ยง 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).
