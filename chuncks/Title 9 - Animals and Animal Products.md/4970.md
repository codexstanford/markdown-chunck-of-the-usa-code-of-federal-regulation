## Chapter I - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture
### Subchapter J - Accreditation of Veterinarians and Suspension or Revocation of Such Accreditation
#### PART 161 - REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR ACCREDITED VETERINARIANS AND SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF SUCH ACCREDITATION
##### ยง 161.6 Suspension or revocation of veterinary accreditation and reaccreditation; criminal and civil penalties.
###### et seq.

(a) The Administrator is authorized to suspend for a given period of time, or to revoke, the accreditation of a veterinarian when he or she determines that the accredited veterinarian has not complied with the "Standards for Accredited Veterinarian Duties" as set forth in ยง 161.4 of this part or with any of the other regulations in this subchapter, or is otherwise found to be unfit to be accredited. Veterinarians who perform duties that only accredited veterinarians are authorized to perform while their accredited status is suspended or revoked will be subject to such criminal and civil penalties as are provided by the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8301) or other applicable Federal statutes or regulations. Performing accredited duties while accreditation status is suspended or revoked will be considered grounds for the Administrator to suspend accreditation, revoke accreditation, or deny application for reaccreditation, as circumstances warrant. A veterinarian whose accreditation has been suspended or revoked or whose application for reaccreditation has been denied may request a hearing under ยง 162.13 to challenge the Administrator's decision.
