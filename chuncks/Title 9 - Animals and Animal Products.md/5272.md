### PART 203 - STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY UNDER THE PACKERS AND STOCKYARDS ACT
#### ยง 203.4 Statement with respect to the disposition of records by packers, live poultry dealers, stockyard owners, market agencies and dealers.
##### Records to be kept.

(a)Section 401 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 221) provides, in part, that every packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, and dealer shall keep such accounts, records, and memoranda as fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business, including the true ownership of such business by stockholding or otherwise. In order to properly administer the P&S Act, it is necessary that records be retained for such periods of time as may be required to permit the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD) a reasonable opportunity to examine such records. Section 401 of the Act does not, however, provide for the destruction or disposal of records. Therefore, the Department has formulated this policy statement to provide guidance as to the periods of time after which records may be disposed of or destroyed.
