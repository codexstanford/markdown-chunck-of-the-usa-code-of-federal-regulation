####### DPP&#xAE; test.

(2)(i) The DPP&#xAE; test is a primary test that may be used in individual captive elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, fallow deer, and reindeer, and in herds of these species that are of unknown tuberculous status. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, each captive cervid that has non-negative test results to this initial DPP&#xAE; test will be classified as a suspect and retested with the DPP&#xAE; test. A captive cervid that has non-negative test results to the DPP&#xAE; test must not be retested using the SCT or CCT test.

(ii) The DPP&#xAE; test is a primary test that may be used in affected herds of captive elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, fallow deer, and reindeer, and in herds of these species that have received captive cervids from an affected herd. In such herds, each captive cervid that has non-negative test results to the DPP&#xAE; test will be classified as a reactor, unless APHIS determines that the captive cervid should be classified as a suspect because of possible exposure to a tuberculous animal.
