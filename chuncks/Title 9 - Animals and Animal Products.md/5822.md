###### § 317.362 Nutrient content claims for fat, fatty acids, and cholesterol content.
####### Cholesterol content claims.

(d)(1) The terms "cholesterol free," "free of cholesterol," "zero cholesterol," "without cholesterol," "no cholesterol," "trivial source of cholesterol," "negligible source of cholesterol," or "dietarily insignificant source of cholesterol" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, provided that:

(i) The product contains less than 2 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), less than 2 mg of cholesterol per labeled serving size;

(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is generally understood by consumers to contain cholesterol, unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: "Adds a trivial amount of cholesterol," "adds a negligible amount of cholesterol," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of cholesterol";

(iii) The product contains 2 g or less of saturated fat per reference amount customarily consumed or, in the case of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), 2 g or less of saturated fat per labeled serving size; and

(iv) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower cholesterol content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which it attaches; or

(v) If the product meets these conditions only as a result of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation, the amount of cholesterol is reduced by 25 percent or more from the reference product it replaces as described in § 317.313(j)(1) and for which it substitutes as described in § 317.313(d) that has a significant (e.g., 5 percent or more of a national or regional market) market share. As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the cholesterol was reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "cholesterol free 'product', contains 100 percent less cholesterol than 'reference product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of cholesterol in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "contains no cholesterol compared with 30 mg in one serving of 'reference product' ").

(2) The terms "low in cholesterol," "low cholesterol," "contains a small amount of cholesterol," "low source of cholesterol," or "little cholesterol" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:

(i)(A) If the product has a reference amount customarily consumed greater than 30 g or greater than 2 tbsp:
