###### Pseudorabies controlled vaccinated herd.

(a) Pseudorabies controlled vaccinated herd status is attained by subjecting all swine over 6 months of age to an official pseudorabies serologic test and finding all swine so tested negative. The herd must not have been a known infected herd within the past 30 days. Any swine in the herd over 6 months of age may be vaccinated for pseudorabies within 15 days after being subjected to an official pseudorabies serologic test and found negative.

(b) If on the qualifying official pseudorabies serologic test or any subsequent official pseudorabies test, any swine so tested are positive, pseudorabies controlled vaccinated herd status is attained or regained by: removing all positive swine; cleaning and disinfecting the herd premises in accordance with ยง 85.13; subjecting all swine in the herd, except swine nursing from their mothers, to an official pseudorabies serologic test 30 days or more after removal of the positive swine and finding all swine so tested negative; and, after an interval of 30 to 60 days after the first such negative official pseudorabies serologic herd test, subjecting all swine in the herd over 6 months of age to another official pseudorabies serologic test and finding all swine so tested negative.

(c)(1) Pseudorabies controlled vaccinated herd status is maintained by: subjecting 25 percent of all the offspring to an official pseudorabies serologic test when they are between 16 and 20 weeks of age and finding all swine so tested negative, or by leaving 10 percent of the swine over 6 months of age in the herd unvaccinated and subjecting all such unvaccinated swine to an official pseudorabies serologic test every 80-105 days and finding all swine so tested negative.
