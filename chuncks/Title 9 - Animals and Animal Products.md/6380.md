####### Free from protruding pinfeathers.

"Free from protruding pinfeathers" means that the carcass is free from protruding pinfeathers which are visible to an inspector during an examination of the carcass at normal operating speeds. However, a carcass may be considered as being free from protruding pinfeathers if it has a generally clean appearance (especially on the breast), and if not more than an occasional protruding pinfeather is in evidence during a more careful examination of the carcass.
