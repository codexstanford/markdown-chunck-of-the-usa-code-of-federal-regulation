####### U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored.

(a)The program in this paragraph (a) is intended to be the basis from which the egg/meat-type game bird and egg/meat-type waterfowl industry may conduct a program to monitor for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza in egg/meat-type game birds and egg/meat-type waterfowl through routine surveillance of each participating slaughter plant or, in the case of egg-producing flocks, the regular surveillance of these flocks. A slaughter plant or flock will qualify for the classification in this paragraph (a) when the Official State Agency determines that it has met one of the following requirements:

(1) It is a meat-type game bird slaughter plant or meat-type waterfowl slaughter plant where a minimum of 11 birds per shift are tested negative for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza, as provided in ยง 146.13(b), at slaughter;

(2) It is a meat-type game bird slaughter plant or meat-type waterfowl slaughter plant that only accepts egg/meat-type game birds or egg/meat-type waterfowl from flocks where a minimum of 11 birds per flock have been tested negative for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza, as provided in ยง 146.13(b), no more than 21 days prior to slaughter;

(3) It is a meat-type game bird slaughter plant or meat-type waterfowl slaughter plant that has an ongoing active and passive surveillance program for H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza that is approved by the Official State Agency and the Service.

(4) It is an egg-type game bird or egg-type waterfowl flock that produces eggs for human consumption where a minimum of 11 birds per flock have been tested negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza as provided in ยง 146.13(b) within 30 days of disposal or within a 12 month period.

(5) It is an egg-type game bird or egg-type waterfowl flock that has an on-going active and passive surveillance program for H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza that is approved by the Official State Agency and the Service.
