###### Market agency selling livestock on commission.

(a)To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the dollar value of livestock sold during the preceding business year, or the substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency did business, by the actual number of days on which livestock was sold. The divisor (the number of days on which livestock was sold) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $50,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $50,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $50,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage for a market agency selling on commission be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.
