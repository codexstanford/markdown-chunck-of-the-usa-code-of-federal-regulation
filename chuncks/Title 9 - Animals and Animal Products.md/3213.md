(c) Any additional certifications or testing requirements established by APHIS, based on genetic susceptibility of the embryo or embryo parents, and/or on scrapie testing of the embryo donor, will be listed in the APHIS import permit. Such certifications or required test results must also be recorded on the health certificate accompanying the embryo(s).

(d) Sheep and goat embryos or oocytes may only be imported for transfer to recipient females in the United States if the flock or herd where the recipients reside is listed in the National Scrapie Database; except APHIS may permit importation of sheep and goat embryos or oocytes to an APHIS-approved storage facility where they may be kept until later transferred to recipient females in a flock or herd in the United States listed in the APHIS National Scrapie Database, and under such conditions as the Administrator deems necessary to trace the movement of the imported embryos or oocytes. Imported sheep or goat embryos or oocytes not otherwise restricted by the conditions of an import permit may be transferred from a listed flock or herd to any other listed flock or herd, or from an embryo storage facility to a listed flock or herd, with written notification to the responsible APHIS Veterinary Services Service Center.

(e) The importer, the owner of a recipient flock or herd where delivery of the embryos or oocytes is made, or the owner of an APHIS-approved embryo or oocyte storage facility must maintain records of the disposition (including destruction) of imported or stored embryos or oocytes for 5 years after the embryo or oocyte is transferred or destroyed. These records must be made available during normal business hours to APHIS representatives on request for review and copying.

(f) For in vitro-derived and manipulated sheep or goat embryos and oocytes, APHIS will make a case-by-case determination or establish conditions in an import permit that includes any additional mitigations deemed necessary to prevent the introduction of disease as provided in ยง 98.10.

(g) The owner of all sheep or goats resulting from embryos or oocytes imported under this section shall:

(1) Identify them at birth with a permanent official identification number consistent with the provisions of ยง 79.2 of this chapter; such identification may not be removed except at slaughter and must be replaced if lost;

(2) Maintain a record linking the official identification number to the imported embryo or oocyte including a record of the replacement of lost tags;

(3) Maintain records of any sale or disposition of such animals, including the date of sale or disposition, the name and address of the buyer, and the animal's official identification number; and

(4) Keep the required records for a period of 5 years after the sale or death of the animal. APHIS may view and copy these records during normal business hours.
