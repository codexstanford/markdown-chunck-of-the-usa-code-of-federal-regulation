##### Where and how do I file a waiver request?

(h)The waiver request must be submitted in writing and include a statement that the packer does not procure swine using marketing agreements. The packer must send the waiver request to the PSD Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa. If the waiver request is approved, PSD will inform the packer in writing that it has been granted a waiver for 12 months following the date of receipt of the waiver request unless the status of the packer changes during that year. The packer will be notified to submit the information required in this part if it begins using marketing agreements during the waiver period or if PSD determines that the packer utilizes marketing agreements.
