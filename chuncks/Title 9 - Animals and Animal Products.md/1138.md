This space shall be limited on each side by the 6-foot fence required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The remaining space around such yards shall be limited as in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(3) If such pens, alleys, chutes, and platforms are isolated from other pens, alleys, chutes, or platforms, there shall be built and maintained outside thereof on all sides to which cattle of the vicinity might otherwise approach a cattle-proof fence not less than 5 feet high and not less than 15 feet from the 6-foot fence required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
