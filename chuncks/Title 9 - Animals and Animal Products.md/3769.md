(4) Each of 20 injected mice from each group shall be challenged subcutaneously 14 to 21 days after being injected. A dose containing at least 100 mouse LDof a suitable culture ofshall be used. All survivors in each group of mice shall be recorded 10 days postchallenge.

(5) Test for valid assay: At least two dilutions of the Standard shall protect more than 0 percent and two dilutions shall protect less than 100 percent of the mice injected. The lowest dilution of the Standard shall protect more than 50 percent of the mice. The highest dilution of the Standard shall protect less than 50 percent of the mice.

(6) The relative potency (RP) of the Unknown is determined by comparing the 50 percent endpoint dilution (highest bacterin dilution protecting 50 percent of the mice) of the Unknown with that of the standard by the following formula:

(7) If the RP of the Unknown is less than 0.6, the serial being tested is unsatisfactory.
