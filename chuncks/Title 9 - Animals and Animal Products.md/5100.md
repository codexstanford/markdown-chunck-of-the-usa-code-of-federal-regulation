##### ยง 201.73-1 Instructions for weighing livestock.
###### Scale tickets.

(d)(1) Scale tickets used to record the weight values of livestock in purchase or sales transactions shall be used, at any given scale, in the order of their consecutive serial numbers unless otherwise marked to show the order of their use. All tickets shall show the date of the weighing and the name or initials of the weigher performing the weighing service.

(2) No scale tickets shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of because they are soiled, damaged, incorrectly executed, or voided. They shall be preserved and filed to comprise a complete serial number sequence.

(3) No scale ticket shall be used to record the weight of a livestock draft for "catch-weight," inventory, transportation charge or other nonsale purposes unless the ticket is clearly marked to show why the weight was determined.

(4) When weight values are recorded by means of automatic recording equipment directly on the accounts of sale or other basic records, such record may serve in lieu of a scale ticket.
