###### Incubation temperature.

(ii)The incubation temperature must be maintained at 95+/-5 &#xB0;F (35+/-2.8 &#xB0;C). If the incubation temperature falls below 90 &#xB0;F (or 32 &#xB0;C) or exceeds 100 &#xB0;F (or 38 &#xB0;C) but does not reach 103 &#xB0;F (or 39.5 &#xB0;C), the incubation temperature must be adjusted within the required range and the incubation time extended for the time the sample containers were held at the deviant temperature. If the incubation temperature is at or above 103 &#xB0;F (or 39.5 &#xB0;C) for more than 2 hours, the incubation test(s) must be terminated, the temperature lowered to within the required range, and new sample containers incubated for the required time.
