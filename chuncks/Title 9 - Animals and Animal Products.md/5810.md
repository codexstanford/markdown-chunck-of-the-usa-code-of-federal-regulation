###### § 317.354 Nutrient content claims for "good source," "high," and "more."
####### "More" claims.

(e)(1) A relative claim using the terms "more" and "added" may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in a product, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l), and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m) provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than 'reference product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "fiber content of 'reference product' is 1 g per serving; 'this product' contains 4 g per serving").

(2) A relative claim using the terms "more" and "added" may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l), and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m) provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 ounces (oz) than does 'reference product' "), and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the meal-type product or a main-dish product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "fiber content of 'reference product' is 2 g per 3 oz; 'this product' contains 5 g per 3 oz").
