(1) Official eartags, when used on any swine;

(2) United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved backtag, when used on swine moving to slaughter;

(3) Official swine tattoos, when used on swine moving to slaughter, when the use of the official swine tattoo has been requested by a user or the State animal health official, and the Administrator authorizes its use in writing based on a determination that the tattoo will be retained and visible on the carcass of the swine after slaughter, so as to provide identification of the swine;

(4) Tattoos of at least 4-characters when used on swine moving to slaughter, except sows and boars as provided in ยง 78.33 of this chapter;

(4) They are not mixed with swine from any other premises, between the time they are born and the time they arrive at the slaughtering establishment; and
