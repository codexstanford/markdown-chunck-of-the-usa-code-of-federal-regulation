(1) A genetically susceptible animal; or

(2) A sheep or sheep embryo of genotype AV QR that the Administrator determines is epidemiologically linked to a scrapie-positive RR or QR sheep, to a flock that the Administrator has determined may be affected by valine-associated scrapie (based on an evaluation of the genotypes of the scrapie-positive animals linked to the flock), or to a scrapie type to which AV QR sheep are susceptible; or

(3) A sheep or sheep embryo of genotype AA QR that the Administrator determines is epidemiologically linked to a scrapie-positive RR or AA QR sheep or to a scrapie type to which AA QR sheep are susceptible; or

(4) A sheep or sheep embryo of genotype RR that the Administrator determines is epidemiologically linked to a scrapie-positive RR sheep or to a scrapie type to which RR sheep are susceptible.
