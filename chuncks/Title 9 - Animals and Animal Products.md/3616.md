####### Identity test.

(c)Methods of identification of Master Seed Bacteria to the genus and species level by laboratory tests shall be sufficient to distinguish the bacteria from other similar bacteria according to criteria described in the most recent edition of "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology" or the American Society for Microbiology "Manual of Clinical Microbiology". If Master Seed Bacteria are referred to by serotype, serovar, subtype, pilus type, strain or other taxonomic subdivision below the species level, adequate testing must be used to identify the bacteria to that level. Tests which may be used to identify Master Seed Bacteria include, but are not limited to:

(1) Cultural characteristics,

(2) Staining reaction,

(3) Biochemical reactivity,

(4) Fluorescent antibody tests,

(5) Serologic tests,

(6) Toxin typing,

(7) Somatic or flagellar antigen characterization, and

(8) Restriction endonuclease analysis.
