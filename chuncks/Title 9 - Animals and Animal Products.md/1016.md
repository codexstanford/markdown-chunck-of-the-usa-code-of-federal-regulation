###### Requirements for compliance agreements.

(c)The compliance agreement is a comprehensive document that describes the depopulation, disposal, and cleaning and disinfection plans for poultry that were infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI, or a premises that contained such poultry. The compliance agreement must set out cost estimates that include labor, materials, supplies, equipment, personal protective equipment, and any additional information deemed necessary by APHIS. A compliance agreement is comparable to a statement of work and must indicate what tasks will be completed, who will be responsible for each task, and how much the work is expected to cost. A compliance agreement may also be referred to as a detailed financial plan. Once work associated with the compliance agreement is completed, receipts and documentation detailing the activities specified in the agreement should be forwarded to APHIS for review, approval, and final payment. This documentation should be submitted to APHIS no later than 30 days after the quarantine release of the affected or exposed premises.
