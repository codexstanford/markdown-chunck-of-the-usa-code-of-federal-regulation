## Chapter I - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture
### Subchapter C - Interstate Transportation of Animals (Including Poultry) and Animal Products
#### PART 71 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
##### ยง 71.20 Approval of livestock facilities.
###### Denial and withdrawal of approval.

(b)The Administrator may deny or withdraw the approval of a livestock facility to receive livestock moved interstate under this subchapter upon a determination that the livestock facility is not or has not been maintained and operated in accordance with the agreement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

(1) In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the denial and may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving notification of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the livestock facility was wrongfully denied approval to receive livestock moved interstate under this subchapter. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

(2) In the case of withdrawal, before such action is taken, the operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The operator of the facility may appeal the proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the reasons for the proposed withdrawal are incorrect or do not support the withdrawal of the approval of the livestock facility to receive livestock moved interstate under this subchapter. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. However, withdrawal shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to protect the public health, interest, or safety. Such withdrawal shall be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator of the facility. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation shall be given as promptly as circumstances allow. This withdrawal shall continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding, and any judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.

(3) Approval for a livestock facility to handle livestock under this subchapter will be automatically withdrawn by the Administrator when:

(i) The operator of the facility notifies the Administrator, in writing, that the facility no longer handles livestock moved interstate under this subchapter; or

(ii) The person who signed the agreement executed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section is no longer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the facility.
