####### DPP&#xAE; test.

(2)The DPP&#xAE; test may be used as a supplemental test in order to retest captive cervids that have been classified as suspects based on an initial DPP&#xAE; test. In such instances, the supplemental DPP&#xAE; test must evaluate a new serum sample drawn from the cervid no sooner than 30 days after the initial DPP&#xAE; test. A captive cervid that has non-negative test results on two successive DPP&#xAE; tests will be classified as a reactor, unless APHIS determines that another disease classification is warranted.
