###### Group/lot identification number (GIN).

The identification number used to uniquely identify a unit of animals that is managed together as one group. The format of the GIN may be either as defined in ยง 86.1 of this chapter, or the flock identification number followed by a six-digit representation of the date on which the group or lot of animals was assembled (MM/DD/YY). If more than one group is created on the same date a sequential number will be added to the end of the GIN. A group lot comprised of animals from a single flock of origin may be subdivided after leaving the premises on which the group lot was formed by adding an S followed by a sequential number to the end of the GIN to create a GIN for each sub group. If a flock identification number is used, the flock identification number, date, and sequential number(s) will be separated by hyphens.
