(1)Official identification numbers for use on animals not in slaughter channels may only be assigned either directly to the owner of a breeding flock for application to animals that originated in a breeding flock owned by them or, in the case of official serial numbers or serial number devices, to APHIS or State representatives or accredited veterinarians or other responsible individuals as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section APHIS or State representatives may apply official identification to animals or issue official identification to owners of breeding flocks for application to animals in those flocks. APHIS and State personnel who apply or issue official identification must provide to APHIS, in a manner acceptable to APHIS, assignment data associating the serial numbers applied to animals or issued to owners, to the flock of origin and, when required, the flock of birth. Accredited veterinarians who apply official serial numbers or devices when requested by APHIS a must provide to APHIS, in a manner acceptable to APHIS, assignment data associating the serial sequences applied to animals to the flock of origin and, when required, the flock of birth. One such method would be to enter the data into the National Scrapie Database. Such requests may be made directly to a person or persons or to accredited veterinarians as a group through amendment of the Scrapie Program Standards Volume 1: National Scrapie Eradication Program.
