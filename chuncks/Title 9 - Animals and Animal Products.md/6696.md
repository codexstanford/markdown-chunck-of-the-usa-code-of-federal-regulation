####### Provided,

(C) When any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, the owner may transport the product in commerce to a retail entity for relabeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate, or to other end users, such as hotels, restaurants or similar institutions; or, relabel the product in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate if the product is already at a retail entity. A hotel, restaurant or similar institution is not required to relabel product misbranded under this subpart;That the product is prepared in meals or as entrees only for sale or service directly to individual consumers at such institutions, and that the mark of inspection is removed or obliterated. Oral permission shall be obtained from the Area Officer-in-Charge of the Compliance Program for the area in which the product is located prior to such transportation or relabeling. The Area Officer-in-Charge shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product, and shall furnish a copy of the authorization record upon request. Before being offered for sale at a retail entity, such product shall be relabeled.

(v) Ready-to-cook chicken may bear the claim "air chilled" or "air chilling" on its label only if the product was chilled under a process that meets the definition of air chilling in ยง 381.66(e).

(c) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:

(1) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.

(2) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date will be a phrase explaining the meaning of such date in terms of "packing" date, "sell by" date, or "use before" date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., "For Maximum Freshness" or "For Best Quality."

(d) When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate are used together in a dry binding matrix in ground or formed poultry products, as permitted in ยง 424.21(c) of subchapter E, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name a statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate.

(e) When transglutaminase enzyme is used to bind pieces of poultry to form a cut of poultry, or to reform a piece of poultry from a multiple cuts of poultry, there shall appear on the label, as part of the product name, a statement that indicates that the product has been "formed" or "reformed," in addition to other preparation steps, e.g., "Formed Turkey Thigh Roast" or "Reformed and Shaped Chicken Breast."

(f) A country of origin statement on the label of any poultry product "covered commodity" as defined in 7 CFR part 65, subpart A, that is to be sold by a "retailer," as defined in 7 CFR 65.240, must comply with the requirements in 7 CFR 65.300 and 65.400.
