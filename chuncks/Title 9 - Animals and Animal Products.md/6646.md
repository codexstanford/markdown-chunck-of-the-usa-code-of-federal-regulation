(2)Contaminated inner surfaces that are not cut may be cleaned at an approved reprocessing station away from the main processing line by any method that will remove the contamination, such as vacuuming, washing, and trimming, singly or in combination. All visible specks of contamination must be removed, and if the inner surfaces are reprocessed other than solely by trimming, all surfaces of the carcass must be treated with chlorinated water containing 20 ppm to 50 ppm available chlorine or another approved antimicrobial substance in accordance with the parameters approved by the Administrator. Establishments must incorporate procedures for the use of any offline reprocessing into their HACCP plans, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite programs.
