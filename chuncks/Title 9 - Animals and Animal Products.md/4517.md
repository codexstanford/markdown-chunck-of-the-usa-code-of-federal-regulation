(l)This program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatchery industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of avian influenza in multiplier breeding chickens through routine surveillance of each participating breeding flock. A flock and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it will qualify for this classification when the Official State Agency determines that they have met the following requirements:

(1) It is a multiplier breeding flock in which a minimum of 30 birds have been tested negative for antibodies to avian influenza using an approved test as described in ยง 145.14 when more than 4 months of age. To retain this classification:

(i) A sample of at least 15 birds must be tested negative at intervals of 90 days; or

(ii) A sample of fewer than 15 birds may be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens are equally represented and a total of 15 birds is tested within each 90-day period; or

(iii) The flock is tested as provided in ยง 145.14(d) at intervals of 30 days or less and found to be negative, and a total of 15 samples are collected and tested within each 90-day period; and

(2) During each 90-day period, all multiplier spent fowl, up to a maximum of 30, must be tested and found negative for avian influenza within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.
