A serological assay to determine the presence of antibodies to bovine tuberculosis () in elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, fallow deer, and reindeer, in which a blood sample taken from a captive cervid and a buffer solution are placed on a strip. The diluted sample then migrates to another strip, which contains an antibody-detecting reagent. This latter strip indicates if antibodies are present in the sample.
