####### trans,trans

(i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of saturated fat and less than 0.5 gfatty acids per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of saturated fat and less than 0.5 gfatty acids per labeled serving size;

(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is generally understood by consumers to contain saturated fat unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: "Adds a trivial amount of saturated fat," "adds a negligible amount of saturated fat," or "adds a dietarily insignificant amount of saturated fat;" and

(iii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower saturated fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(2) The terms "low in saturated fat," "low saturated fat," "contains a small amount of saturated fat," "low source of saturated fat," or "a little saturated fat" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains 1 g or less of saturated fat per reference amount customarily consumed and not more than 15 percent of calories from saturated fat; and

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower saturated fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(3) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains 1 g or less of saturated fat per 100 g and less than 10 percent calories from saturated fat; and

(ii) If the product meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to lower saturated fat content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all products of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches.

(4) The terms "reduced saturated fat," "reduced in saturated fat," "saturated fat reduced," "less saturated fat," "lower saturated fat," or "lower in saturated fat" may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less saturated fat per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the saturated fat differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced saturated fat 'product', contains 50 percent less saturated fat than the national average for 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of saturated fat in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "saturated fat reduced from 3 g to 1.5 g per serving").

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low saturated fat."

(5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less saturated fat per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and

(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:

(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the saturated fat differs between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., "reduced saturated fat 'product', 50 percent less saturated fat than our regular 'product' "); and

(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of saturated fat in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., "saturated fat content has been reduced from 2.5 g per 3 oz to 1.5 g per 3 oz").

(iii) Claims described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the definition for "low saturated fat."
