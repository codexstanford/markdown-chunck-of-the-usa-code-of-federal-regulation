##### ยง 205.204 Filing "notice" of EFS.

(a) If an EFS is filed somewhere other than with the system operator, and if notice of it is filed with the system operator, such notice could be electronic filing, telephoned information, or any other form of notice which gives the system operator the information needed for the master list. Such notice need not be signed. Note that the Section does not contain any requirement for such notice except the one in subsection (c)(4)(B) that an EFS must be filed somewhere pursuant to State law as discussed above.

(b) Countermeasures against falsifications, errors or omissions in such notices or in the handling of them by the system operator, such as requirements that the notices be on paper and signed, with copies date-stamped and returned to the persons filing them, however advisable they might be from other standpoints, are discretionary with the State and not required by the Section.
