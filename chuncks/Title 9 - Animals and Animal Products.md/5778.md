(7)(i) No ingredient shall be designated on the label as a spice, flavoring, or coloring unless it is a spice, flavoring, or coloring, as the case may be. An ingredient that is both a spice and a coloring, or both a flavoring and a coloring, shall be designated as "spice and coloring", or "flavoring and coloring", as the case may be, unless such ingredient is designated by its common or usual name.

(ii) Any ingredient not designated in ยง 317.2(f)(1)(i) of this part whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock and poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.

(8) As used on labels of product, the term "gelatin" shall mean (i) the jelly prepared in official establishments by cooking pork skins, tendons, or connective tissue from inspected and passed product, and (ii) dry commercial gelatin or the jelly resulting from its use.

(i) If distributed from the official establishment in consumer size containers may be in any shape;

(ii) If distributed in a container of a size larger than that sold intact at retail the product shall be prepared in rectangular form, or as in paragraph (b)(9)(iii) of this section;

(10) The term "baked" shall apply only to product which has been cooked by the direct action of dry heat and for a sufficient time to permit the product to assume the characteristics of a baked article, such as the formation of a brown crust on the surface, rendering out of surface fat, and the caramelization of the sugar if applied. Baked loaves shall be heated to a temperature of at least 160 &#xB0;F. and baked pork cuts shall be heated to an internal temperature of at least 170 &#xB0;F.

(11) When products such as loaves are browned by dipping in hot edible oil or by a flame, the label shall state such fact, e.g., by the words "Browned in Hot Cottonseed Oil" or "Browned by a Flame," as the case may be, appearing as part of the product name.

(12) The term "meat" and the names of particular kinds of meat, such as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork, shall not be used in such manner as to be false or misleading.

(13) The word "ham," without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine. Ham shanks as such or ham shank meat as such or the trimmings accruing in the trimming and shaping of hams shall not be labeled "ham" or "ham meat" without qualification.

Extracts prepared from any parts of the carcass other than fresh meat may be properly labeled as extracts with the true name of the parts from which prepared. In the case of extract in fluid form, the word "fluid" shall also appear on the label, as, for example, "fluid extract of beef."

(16) [Reserved]

(17) When any product is enclosed in a container along with a packing substance such as brine, vinegar, or agar jelly, a declaration of the packing substance shall be printed prominently on the label as part of the name of the product, as for example, "frankfurts packed in brine," "lamb tongue packed in vinegar," or "beef tongue packed in agar jelly," as the case may be. The packing substance shall not be used in such a manner as will result in the container being so filled as to be misleading.

(18) "Leaf lard" is lard prepared from fresh leaf fat.

(19) When lard or hardened lard is mixed with rendered pork fat or hardened rendered pork fat, the mixture shall be designated as "rendered pork fat" or "hardened rendered pork fat," as the case may be.

If more than 20 percent is added, the product name shall refer to the particular animal fat or fats used, such as, "Lard and Beef Fat." The designation "vegetable fat" is applicable to vegetable oil, vegetable stearin, or a combination of such oil and stearin, whereas the designations "vegetable oil" and "vegetable stearin" shall be applicable only to the oil and the stearin respectively, when used in meat food products.

(22) Cooked, cured, or pickled pigs feet, pigs knuckles, and similar products, shall be labeled to show that the bones remain in the product, if such is the case. The designation "semi-boneless" shall not be used if less than 50 percent of the total weight of bones has been removed.

(23) When monoglycerides, diglycerides, and/or polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are added to rendered animal fat or a combination of such fat and vegetable fat, there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of the product a statement such as "With Monoglycerides and Diglycerides Added," or "With Diglycerides and Monoglycerides," or "With Polyglycerol Esters of Fatty Acids" as the case may be.

Any other approved substance which may be used in the solution shall also be included in the statement.

When approved inorganic chlorides as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter are used on steaks or other raw meat cuts there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement, "Tenderized with (names of approved inorganic chloride(s))" to indicate the use of such inorganic chlorides. Any other approved substance which may be in the solution shall also be included in the statement.

(26) When dimethylpolysiloxan is added as an antifoaming agent to rendered fats, its presence shall be declared on the label contiguous to the name of the product. Such declaration shall read "Dimethylpolysiloxan Added."

(32) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph:

(i) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.

(ii) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date there must be a phrase explaining the meaning of the date, in terms of "packing" date, "sell by" date, or "use before" date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., "For Maximum Freshness" or "For Best Quality."
