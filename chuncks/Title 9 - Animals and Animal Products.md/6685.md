The above-specified statements may be added to approved shipping container labels upon approval by the inspector in charge.

(b) When a poultry product and a nonpoultry product are separately wrapped and are placed in a single immediate container bearing the same name of both products, the net weight on such immediate container may be the total net weight of the products, or such immediate container may show the net weights of the poultry product and the nonpoultry product separately. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, the label on consumer size retail packages of stuffed poultry and other stuffed poultry products must show the total net weight of the poultry product, and in close proximity thereto, a statement specifying the minimum weight of the poultry in the product.

An unused tare weight, as defined in section 381.121b of this subchapter, may be printed adjacent to the statement of net quantity of contents when the product is packaged totally with impervious packaging material and is packed with a usable medium.
