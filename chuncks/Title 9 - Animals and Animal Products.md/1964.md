###### Group/lot identification number (GIN).

The identification number used to uniquely identify a "unit of animals" of the same species that is managed together as one group throughout the preharvest production chain. When a GIN is used, it is recorded on documents accompanying the animals moving interstate; it is not necessary to have the GIN attached to each animal.
