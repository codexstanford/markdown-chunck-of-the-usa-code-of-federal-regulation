####### Reactor cattle and bison.

(a)Cattle or bison that have been classified as reactor cattle or bison may be moved interstate only if they are moved directly to slaughter at a recognized slaughtering establishment and only in accordance with the following conditions:

(1) Reactor cattle and bison must be individually identified by attaching to the left ear an approved metal eartag bearing a serial number and the inscription "U.S. Reactor," or a similar State reactor tag, and must be:

(i) Branded with the letter "T," at least 5 by 5 centimeters (2 by 2 inches) in size, high on the left hip near the tailhead; or

(ii) Permanently identified with the letters "TB" tattooed legibly in the left ear and sprayed with yellow paint on the left ear and either accompanied directly to slaughter by an APHIS or State representative or moved directly to slaughter in vehicles closed with official seals. Such official seals must be applied and removed by an APHIS representative, State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an individual authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative.

(2) The reactor cattle or bison must be accompanied by a permit; and

(3) The reactor cattle or bison may not be moved interstate in a means of conveyance containing any animals susceptible to tuberculosis unless all of the animals are being moved directly to slaughter; and

(4) Any person who moves reactor cattle or bison interstate under this paragraph must plainly write or stamp upon the face of the VS Form 1-27 the words "Tuberculin Reactor" and the following statement: "This conveyance must be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 9 CFR 77.17(a)(5)."; and

(5) Each means of conveyance in which reactor cattle or bison have been transported interstate under this paragraph must be cleaned and disinfected by the carrier, in accordance with the provisions of §§ 71.6, 71.7, and 71.10 of this subchapter, under the supervision of an APHIS representative or State representative or an accredited veterinarian or other person designated by the Administrator. If, at the point where the cattle or bison are unloaded, such supervision or proper cleaning and disinfecting facilities are not available, and permission is obtained from an APHIS representative or State representative, the empty means of conveyance may be moved to a location where such supervision and facilities are available for cleaning and disinfecting. Permission will be granted if such movement does not present a risk of disseminating tuberculosis.
