####### Provided,

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., "Chicken for Pets" or "Turkey Dinner for Cats":That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass, but shall not be less thaninch high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.

(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of poultry carcass-source material contrast with their background.

(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feed manufactured from processed poultry byproducts (such as poultry byproduct meal, hydrolyzed poultry feathers, and hydrolyzed poultry byproducts aggregate), or to processed dry animal food.
