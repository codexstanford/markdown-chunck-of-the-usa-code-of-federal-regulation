#### Subpart S - Conflicts of Interest
##### ยง 1000.463 What types of personal conflicts of interest involving tribal officers, employees or subcontractors would have to be regulated by a Tribe/Consortium?

The Tribe/Consortium would need a tribally-approved mechanism to ensure that no officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) of the Tribe/Consortium reviews a trust transaction in which that person has a financial or employment interest that conflicts with that of the trust beneficiary, whether the tribe/consortium or an allottee. Interests arising from membership in, or employment by, a Tribe/Consortium or rights to share in a tribal claim need not be regulated.
