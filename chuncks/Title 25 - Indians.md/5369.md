##### Indian product,In general.

(d)-(1)The term "Indian product" means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the term "made by an Indian" means that an Indian has provided the artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the Indian art or craft object to be an "Indian product."
