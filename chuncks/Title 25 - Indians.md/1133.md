###### Personal leave.

(1)A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.

(i) The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.
