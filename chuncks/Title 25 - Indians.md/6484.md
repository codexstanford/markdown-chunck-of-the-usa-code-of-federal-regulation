An investigation completion letter does not constitute a finding that no violation of IGRA, NIGC regulations, or a tribe's approved gaming ordinance or resolution occurred. Further, an investigation completion letter does not preclude the reopening of an investigation or the initiation of an enforcement action by the Chair.
