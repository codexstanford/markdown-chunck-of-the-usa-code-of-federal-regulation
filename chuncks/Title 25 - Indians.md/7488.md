###### ยง 1000.141 Is there a predetermined cap or limit on indirect cost rates or a fixed formula for calculating indirect cost rates?

No, indirect cost rates vary from Tribe to Tribe. The Secretary should refer to the appropriate negotiated indirect cost rates for individual Tribes, that apply government-wide. Although this cost rate is not capped, the amount of funds available for inclusion is capped at the level available under the relevant appropriation.
