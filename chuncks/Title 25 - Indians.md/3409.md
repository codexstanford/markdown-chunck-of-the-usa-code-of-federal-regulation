###### ยง 166.607 Is insurance required for a permit?

When we determine it to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners, we will require a permittee to provide insurance. If insurance is required, it must:

(a) Be provided in an amount sufficient to:

(1) Protect any improvements on the permit premises;

(2) Cover losses such as personal injury or death; and

(3) Protect the interest of the Indian landowner.

(b) Identify the tribe, individual Indian landowners, and United States as insured parties.
