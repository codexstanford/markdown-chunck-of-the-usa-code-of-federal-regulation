###### Determination and offer of fair market value.

(b)Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall establish an amount which it believes is fair market value for improvements. This amount shall be based on a current appraisal at the time negotations commence for the Relocation Contract between the NHIRC and the relocatee. The appraisal will be adjusted according to the Boeckh Building Cost Modifier for time or any physical changes in the improvements. If any changes are necessary the appraisal will be corrected to reflect a current dollar value. The amount of the current appraisal will be offered as just compensation for the improvements acquired, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A copy of the initial appraisal will be sent to the owner as soon as possible after the appraisal program is completed.
