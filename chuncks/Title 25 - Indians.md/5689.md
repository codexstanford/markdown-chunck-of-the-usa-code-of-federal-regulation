###### Call bets

means a wager made without cash or chips, reserved for a known customer and includes marked bets (which are supplemental bets made during a hand of play). For the purpose of settling a call bet, a hand of play in craps is defined as a natural winner (e.g., seven or eleven on the come-out roll), a natural loser (e.g., a two, three or twelve on the come-out roll), a seven-out, or the player making his point, whichever comes first.
