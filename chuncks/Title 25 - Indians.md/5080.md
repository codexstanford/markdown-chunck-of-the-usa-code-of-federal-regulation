2.The application of these principles is based on the fundamental premises that:

a. Grantees are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of grant programs through the application of sound management practices.

b. The grantee assumes the responsibility for seeing that Bureau assisted program funds have been expended and accounted for consistent with underlying agreements and program objectives.

c. Each grantee organization, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and management techniques may be necessary to assure proper and efficient administration.
