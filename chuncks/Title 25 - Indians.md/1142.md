(d)(1) Employees on a part-time work schedule in excess of 20 hours per week may receive a maximum of 102 hours of school vacation time; 20 hours of personal/emergency leave; and 63 hours of sick leave accrued at three hours per pay period for the first 21 pay periods of their contracts. Personal/emergency leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.

When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.

(3) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be taken only during the school year. No compensation for or carryover of unused leave is authorized.
