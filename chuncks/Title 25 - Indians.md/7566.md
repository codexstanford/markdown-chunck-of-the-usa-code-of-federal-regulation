The following general guidance is not intended as a definitive description of coverage, which is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the courts on a case-by-case basis.

(b) What claims may not be pursued under FTCA?

(1) Claims against subcontractors arising out of the performance of subcontracts with a Self-Governance Tribe/Consortium;

(2) Claims for on-the-job injuries which are covered by workmen's compensation;

(3) Claims for breach of contract rather than tort claims; or

(4) Claims resulting from activities performed by an employee which are outside the scope of employment.

(c) What remedies are expressly excluded by FTCA and therefore are barred?

(1) Punitive damages, unless otherwise authorized by 28 U.S.C. 2674; and

(2) Other remedies not permitted under applicable state law.
