###### Payment standards.

(c)(1) All payments received on outstanding credit instruments shall be recorded in ink or other permanent form of recordation in the gaming operation's records.

(2) When partial payments are made on credit instruments, they shall be evidenced by a multi-part receipt (or another equivalent document) that contains:

(i) The same preprinted number on all copies;

(ii) Customer's name;

(iii) Date of payment;

(iv) Dollar amount of payment (or remaining balance if a new marker is issued), and nature of settlement (cash, chips, etc.);

(v) Signature of employee receiving payment; and

(vi) Number of credit instrument on which partial payment is being made.

(3) Unless account balances are routinely confirmed on a random basis by the accounting or internal audit departments, or statements are mailed by a person independent of the credit transactions and collections thereon, and the department receiving payments cannot access cash, then the following standards shall apply:

(i) The routing procedures for payments by mail require that they be received by a department independent of credit instrument custody and collection;

(ii) Such receipts by mail shall be documented on a listing indicating the customer's name, amount of payment, nature of payment (if other than a check), and date payment received; and

(iii) The total amount of the listing of mail receipts shall be reconciled with the total mail receipts recorded on the appropriate accountability form by the accounting department on a random basis (for at least three (3) days per month).
