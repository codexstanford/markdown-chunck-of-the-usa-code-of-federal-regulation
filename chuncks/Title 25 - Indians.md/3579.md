####### ยง 169.101 How do I obtain a right-of-way across tribal or individually owned Indian land or BIA land?

(a) To obtain a right-of-way across tribal or individually owned Indian land or BIA land, you must submit a complete application to the BIA office with jurisdiction over the land covered by the right-of-way.

(b) If you must obtain access to Indian land to prepare information required by the application (e.g., to survey), you must obtain the consent of the Indian landowners, but our approval to access is not required. Upon written request, we will provide you with the names, addresses, and percentage of ownership of individual Indian landowners, to allow you to obtain the landowners' consent to survey.

(c) If the BIA will be granting the right-of-way across Indian land under ยง 169.107(b), then the BIA may grant permission to access the land.
