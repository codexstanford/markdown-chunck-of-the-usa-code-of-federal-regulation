###### Payment of penalty.

(i)(1) The person assessed a civil penalty shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a U.S. District Court, as provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.

(2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal Land Manager may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the penalty in a U.S. District Court for any district in which the person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts business. Where the Federal Land Manager is not represented by the Attorney General, a civil action may be initiated directly by the Federal Land Manager.
