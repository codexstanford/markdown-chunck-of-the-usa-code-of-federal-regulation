The Secretary will, to the extent practicable, and subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure full geographic coverage and the full participation of all federally recognized Tribes and school districts, regardless of whether the school districts or Tribal organizations had entered into a contract under the Johnson-O'Malley Act before fiscal year 1995.
