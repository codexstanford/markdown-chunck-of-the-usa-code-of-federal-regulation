###### ยง 1000.106 Once a Tribe/Consortium establishes a base budget, are funding amounts renegotiated each year?

No, unless otherwise requested by the Tribe/Consortium, these amounts are not renegotiated each year. If a Tribe/Consortium renegotiates funding levels:

(a) It must negotiate all funding levels in the AFA using the process for determining residuals and funding amounts on the same basis as other Tribes; and

(b) It is eligible for funding amounts of new programs or available programs not previously included in the AFA on the same basis as other Tribes.
