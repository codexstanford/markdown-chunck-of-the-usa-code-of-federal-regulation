#### PART 543 - MINIMUM INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS FOR CLASS II GAMING
##### ยง 543.17 What are the minimum internal control standards for drop and count?
###### Card game count standards.

(f)(1) Access to stored, full card game drop boxes must be restricted to:

(i) Authorized members of the drop and count teams; and

(ii) In an emergency, authorized persons for the resolution of a problem.

(2) The card game count must be performed in a count room or other equivalently secure area with comparable controls.

(3) Access to the count room during the count must be restricted to members of the drop and count teams, with the exception of authorized observers, supervisors for resolution of problems, and authorized maintenance personnel.

(4) If counts from various revenue centers occur simultaneously in the count room, procedures must be in effect to prevent the commingling of funds from different revenue centers.

(5) Count equipment and systems must be tested, with the results documented, at minimum before the first count begins to ensure the accuracy of the equipment.

(6) The card game drop boxes must be individually emptied and counted so as to prevent the commingling of funds between boxes until the count of the box has been recorded.

(i) The count of each box must be recorded in ink or other permanent form of recordation.

(ii) For counts that do not utilize a currency counter, a second count must be performed by a member of the count team who did not perform the initial count. Separate counts of chips and tokens must always be performed by members of the count team.

(iii) Coupons or other promotional items not included in gross revenue must be recorded on a supplemental document by either the count team members or accounting personnel. All single-use coupons must be cancelled daily by an authorized agent to prevent improper recirculation.

(iv) If a currency counter interface is used:

(A) It must be restricted to prevent unauthorized access; and

(B) The currency drop figures must be transferred via direct communications line or computer storage media to the accounting department.

(7) If currency counters are utilized, a count team member must observe the loading and unloading of all currency at the currency counter, including rejected currency.

(8) Two counts of the currency rejected by the currency counter must be recorded per table, as well as in total. Posting rejected currency to a nonexistent table is prohibited.

(9) Card game drop boxes, when empty, must be shown to another member of the count team, to another agent observing the count, or to surveillance, provided that the count is monitored in its entirety by an agent independent of the count.

(10) Procedures must be implemented to ensure that any corrections to the count documentation are permanent and identifiable, and that the original, corrected information remains legible. Corrections must be verified by two count team agents.

(11) The count sheet must be reconciled to the total drop by a count team member who may not function as the sole recorder, and variances must be reconciled and documented.

(12) All count team agents must sign the count sheet attesting to their participation in the count.

(13) A final verification of the total drop proceeds, before transfer to cage/vault, must be performed by at least two agents, one of whom is a supervisory count team member, and one a count team agent.

(i) Final verification must include a comparison of currency counted totals against the currency counter/system report, if any counter/system is used.

(ii) Any unresolved variances must be documented, and the documentation must remain part of the final count record forwarded to accounting.

(iii) This verification does not require a complete recount of the drop proceeds, but does require a review sufficient to verify the total drop proceeds being transferred.

(iv) The two agents must sign the report attesting to the accuracy of the total drop proceeds verified.

(v) All drop proceeds and cash equivalents that were counted must be submitted to the cage or vault agent (who must be independent of the count team), or to an agent independent of the revenue generation source and the count process, for verification. The agent must certify, by signature, the amount of the drop proceeds delivered and received. Any unresolved variances must be reconciled, documented, and/or investigated by accounting/revenue audit.

(14) After verification by the agent receiving the funds, the drop proceeds must be transferred to the cage/vault.

(i) The count documentation and records must not be transferred to the cage/vault with the drop proceeds.

(ii) The cage/vault agent must have no knowledge or record of the drop proceeds total before it is verified.

(iii) All count records must be forwarded to accounting or secured and accessible only by accounting agents.

(iv) The cage/vault agent receiving the transferred drop proceeds must sign the count sheet attesting to the verification of the total received, and thereby assume accountability of the drop proceeds, ending the count.

(v) Any unresolved variances between total drop proceeds recorded on the count sheet and the cage/vault final verification during transfer must be documented and investigated.

(15) The count sheet, with all supporting documents, must be delivered to the accounting department by a count team member or an agent independent of the cage/vault. Alternatively, it may be secured so that it is only accessible to accounting agents.
