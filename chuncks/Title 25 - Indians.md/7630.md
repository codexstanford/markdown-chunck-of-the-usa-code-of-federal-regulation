##### ยง 1000.390 How can a Tribe/Consortium hire a Federal employee to help implement an AFA?

If a Tribe/Consortium chooses to hire a Federal employee, it can use one of the arrangements listed in this section:

(a) The Tribe can use its own Tribal personnel hiring procedures. Federal employees hired by the Tribe/Consortium are separated from Federal service.

(b) The Tribe can "direct hire" a Federal employee as a Tribal employee. The employee will be separated from Federal service and work for the Tribe/Consortium, but maintain a negotiated Federal benefit package that is paid for by the Tribe/Consortium out of AFA program funds; or

(c) The Tribe can negotiate an agreement under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, 25 U.S.C. 48, or other applicable Federal law. The employee will remain a Federal employee during the term of the agreement.
