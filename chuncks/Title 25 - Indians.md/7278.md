Yes. There are claims against self-determination contractors which are not covered by FTCA, claims which may not be pursued under FTCA, and remedies that are excluded by FTCA. General guidance is provided below as to these matters but is not intended as a definitive description of coverage, which is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the courts on a case-by-case basis.
