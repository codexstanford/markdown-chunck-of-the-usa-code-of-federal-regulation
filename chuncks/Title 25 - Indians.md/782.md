####### Computer adaptive assessments.

(d)(1) BIE retains the right to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments as the assessments described in this section, provided the computer adaptive assessments meet the requirements of this section, except that:

(i) The requirement that the same academic assessments must be used to measure the achievement of all BIE-funded school students and that the assessments must be administered to all BIE-funded school students may not be interpreted to require that all students taking the computer adaptive assessment be administered the same assessment items; and

(ii) Such assessment:

(A) Must measure, at a minimum, each student's academic proficiency based on the challenging academic standards for the student's grade level and growth toward such standards; and

(B) May measure the student's level of academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student's grade level, including for use as part of the accountability system.

(2) In developing and administering computer adaptive assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and English learners:

(i) The BIE will ensure that the computer adaptive assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities:

(A) Assess a student's academic achievement based on the challenging academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;

(B) Meet the requirements of this section and §§ 30.106 through 30.110, including § 30.108, except the assessments are not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and

(C) Assess the student's academic achievement to measure, in the subject being assessed, whether the student is performing at the student's grade level; and

(ii) The BIE may provide for the use of computer adaptive assessments that:

(A) Meet the requirements §§ 30.106 through 30.110 except the assessments are not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and

(B) Assess the student's English language proficiency, which may include growth towards such proficiency, in order to measure the student's acquisition of English.
