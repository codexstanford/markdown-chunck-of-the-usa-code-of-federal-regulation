###### ยง 1000.21 When does a Tribe/Consortium have a "material audit exception"?

A Tribe/Consortium has a material audit exception if any of the audits that it submitted under ยง 1000.17(c) identifies:

(a) A material weakness, that is a condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal control components does reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions;

(b) a single finding of known questioned costs subsequently disallowed by a contracting officer or awarding official that exceeds $10,000. If the audits submitted under ยง 1000.17(c) identify any of the conditions described in this section, the Tribe/Consortium must also submit copies of the contracting officer's findings and determinations.
