####### Requirements for academic assessments.

(b)The academic assessments must:

(1) Except with respect to alternate assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, be:

(i) The same academic assessments used to measure the achievement of all BIE-funded school students; and

(ii) Administered to all BIE-funded school students, including the following highly-mobile student populations:

(A) Students with status as a migratory child;

(B) Students with status as a homeless child or youth;

(C) Students with status as a child in foster care;

(D) Students with status as a student with a parent who is a member of the armed forces on active duty or serves on full-time National Guard duty;

(2) Be aligned with the BIE's challenging academic standards, and provide coherent and timely information about student attainment of such standards and whether the student is performing at the student's grade level;

(3) Be used for purposes for which such assessments are valid and reliable, consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical testing standards; objectively measure academic achievement, knowledge, and skills; and use tests that do not evaluate or assess personal or family beliefs and attitudes, or publicly disclose personally identifiable information, except that this provision does not preclude the use of:

(i) Constructed-response, short answer, or essay questions; or

(ii) Items that require a student to analyze a passage of text or to express opinions;

(4) Be of adequate technical quality for each purpose required under the Act and consistent with the requirements of this section, the evidence of which will be made public, including on the BIE website;

(5) Be administered:

(i) In the case of mathematics and reading or language arts:

(A) In each of grades three (3) through eight (8); and

(B) At least once in grades nine (9) through twelve (12);

(ii) In the case of science, not less than one time during:

(A) Grades three (3) through five (5);

(B) Grades six (6) through nine (9); and

(C) Grades ten (10) through twelve (12); and

(iii) In the case of any other subject chosen by the BIE, at the discretion of the BIE;

(6) Involve multiple up-to-date measures of student academic achievement, including measures that assess higher-order thinking skills, such as critical thinking, reasoning, analysis, complex problem solving, effective communication, and understanding of challenging content, which may:

(i) Include valid and reliable measures of student academic growth at all achievement levels to help ensure that the assessment results could be used to improve student instruction; and

(ii) Be partially delivered in the form of portfolios, projects, or extended performance tasks;

(7) At the BIE's discretion, be administered through:

(i) A single summative assessment; or

(ii) Multiple Bureau-wide interim assessments during the course of the academic year that result in a single summative score that provides valid, reliable, and transparent information on student achievement or growth;

(8) Produce individual student interpretive, descriptive, and diagnostic reports, consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, regarding achievement on such assessments that allow parents, teachers, principals, and other school leaders to understand and address the specific academic needs of students, and that are provided to parents, teachers, and school leaders, as soon as is practicable after the assessment is given, in an understandable and uniform format, and to the extent practicable, in a language that parents can understand;

(9) Enable results to be disaggregated:

(i) Within the Bureau and each BIE-funded school by:

(A) Each major racial and ethnic group;

(B) Economically disadvantaged students as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged;

(C) Children with disabilities as defined in section 602(3) of the IDEA compared to children without disabilities;

(D) English proficiency status;

(E) Gender;

(F) Migrant status;

(G) Status as a homeless child or youth as defined in section 725(2) of title VII, subtitle B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended;

(H) Status as a child in foster care; and

(I) Status as a student with a parent who is a member of the armed forces on active duty or serves on full-time National Guard duty.

(ii) Disaggregation is not required in the cases in which the number of students in a subgroup is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student;

(10) Enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported, consistent with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to BIE-funded schools, so that parents, teachers, principals, other school leaders, and administrators can interpret and address the specific academic needs of students as indicated by the students' achievement on assessment items; and

(11) Be designed and developed:

(i) To be valid and accessible for use by all students, including students with disabilities and English learners; and

(ii) To the extent practicable, using the principles of universal design for learning. For the purposes of this section, "universal design for learning" means a scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice that:

(A) Provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and

(B) Reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations, supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement expectations for all students, including students with disabilities and English learners.
