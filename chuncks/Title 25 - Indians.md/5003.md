(b) Reflect the amounts and sources of funds other than Bureau contract funds that may be included in the operation of the contract;

(c) Provide for the creation, maintenance, and safeguarding of records of lasting value, including those involving individual rights, such as permanent records and transcripts; and

(d) Provide for the orderly retirement of permanent records in accordance with Department Records Schedule (Bureau of Indian Affairs (075)), when there is no established system set up by the State, public school district, or Indian corporation.
