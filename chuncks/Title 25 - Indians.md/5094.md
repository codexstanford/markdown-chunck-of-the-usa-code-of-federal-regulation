###### Applicable credits.

3.a. Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce expense items allocable to grants as direct or indirect costs. Examples of such transactions are: purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, and scrap; income from personal or incidental services; and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges.

b. Applicable credits may also arise when Bureau funds are received or are available from sources other than the grant program involved to finance operations or capital items of the grantee. This includes costs arising from the use of depreciation of items donated or financed by the Bureau to fulfill matching requirements under another grant program. These types of credits should likewise be used to reduce related expenditures in determining the rates or amounts applicable to a given grant.
