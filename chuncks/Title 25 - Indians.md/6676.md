(b)A business qualifies for payment under this section if the Commission determines that-

(1) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage.

(2) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having another establishment, which is not being acquired by the Commission, and which is under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities. For purposes of this rule, no remaining business facility which had average annual gross receipts of less than $1,000 and average annual net earnings of less than $500, during the two taxable years prior to displacement, shall be considered "another establishment"; and

(3) The business had (i) average annual gross receipts of at least $1,000 during the two taxable years prior to displacement, or (ii) average annual net earnings of at least $500 as determined in accordance with ยง 700.173. However, the Commission may waive this test in any case in which it determines that its use would cause a substantial hardship.
