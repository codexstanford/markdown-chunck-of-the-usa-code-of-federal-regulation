#### Subpart S - Conflicts of Interest
##### ยง 1000.465 May a Tribe/Consortium negotiate AFA provisions on conflicts of interest to take the place of this subpart?

(1) Address the issues specific to the program and activities contracted; and

(2) Provide equivalent protection against conflicts of interest to these regulations.

(b) Agreed-upon AFA provisions shall be followed, rather than the related provisions of this subpart.
