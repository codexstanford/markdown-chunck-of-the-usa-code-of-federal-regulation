(b)Any modification of the terms and provisions of a loan agreement of a borrower from an organization conducting a relending program must be in writing, agreed to by the borrower, and must be approved by the body authorized to act on loans and modifications thereof as provided in an approved declaration of policy and plan of operation or other plan.
