####### Restricted lands

means real property, the title to which is held by an Indian but which cannot be alienated or encumbered without the Secretary's consent. For the purpose of probate proceedings, restricted lands are treated as if they were trust lands. Except as the law may provide otherwise, the term "restricted lands" as used in this part does not include the restricted lands of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma or the Osage Nation.
