(2) By mail to the facility officially designated for receipt of mail addressed to the official; the document is considered filed by mail on the date that it is postmarked.

(b) Bureau of Indian Affairs offices receiving a misdirected appeal document shall forward the document to the proper office promptly. If a person delivers an appeal document to the wrong office or mails an appeal document to an incorrect address, no extension of time should be allowed because of the time necessary for a Bureau office to redirect the document to the correct address.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an official deciding an appeal shall allow late filing of a misdirected document, including a notice of appeal, where the official finds that the misdirection is the fault of the government.
