####### ยง 162.341 How will BIA decide whether to approve a residential lease?

(a) We will approve a residential lease unless:

(1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the lease;

(2) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or

(3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

(b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the residential lease is in their best interest.

(c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a lease.
