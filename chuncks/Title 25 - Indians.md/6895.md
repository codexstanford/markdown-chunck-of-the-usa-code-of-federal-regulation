##### ยง 700.521 Outside work and interests.

Commission employees may engage in outside work or other activity which does not create a conflict between the employee's private interests and official duties nor prevent employees from devoting their talents and energies to the Commission. An employee's outside work shall not reflect discredit upon the Commission.

(a) Employees engaged in or considering outside employment shall inform their supervisor of the work, and supply such additional details as may be required to determine whether the employment is compatible with the full and proper discharge of the employee's official duties.

(b) Similarly, employees shall inform the supervisor and request approval of other types of outside activities which may present an actual or apparent conflict of interest between the employees' official duties and their private lives. The supervisor shall determine if the outside employment or activity is prohibited by these regulations, and so inform the employee. The Designated Agency Ethics Official is available to assist supervisors in making such determinations.
