####### ยง 115.813 Is there a limit to the amount of trust funds OTFM will disburse from a tribal trust account?

OTFM will only disburse the available balance of the trust funds in a tribal trust account in accordance with a use and distribution plan, if applicable, and will not overdraw a tribal trust account. If a tribe's trust funds are invested in securities that have not matured, OTFM will only sell the asset to make cash available to the tribe if:

(a) There are no restrictions against the sale, and

(b) A tribe provides OTFM with a tribal resolution stating that:

(1) The security must be sold;

(2) The tribe acknowledges that they may incur a penalty when the security is sold; and

(3) The tribe acknowledges that the security may lose value if it is sold prior to maturity.
