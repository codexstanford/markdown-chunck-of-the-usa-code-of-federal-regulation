###### ยง 1000.98 How does BIA determine a Tribe's/Consortium's share of funds to be included in an AFA?
####### Formula-driven.

(a)For formula-driven programs, a Tribe's/Consortium's amount is determined by first identifying the residual funds to be retained by BIA and second, by applying the distribution formula to the remaining eligible funding for each program involved.

(1) Distribution formulas must be reasonably related to the function or service performed by an office, and must be consistently applied to all Tribes within each regional and agency office.

(2) The process in paragraph (a) of this section for calculating a Tribe's funding under self-governance must be consistent with the process used for calculating funds available to non-self-governance Tribes.
