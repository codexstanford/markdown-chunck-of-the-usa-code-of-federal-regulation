####### ยง 162.531 How will BIA decide whether to approve a WEEL?

(a) We will approve a WEEL unless:

(1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the WEEL;

(2) The requirements applicable to WEELs have not been met; or

(3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

(b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the WEEL is in their best interest.

(c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a WEEL.
