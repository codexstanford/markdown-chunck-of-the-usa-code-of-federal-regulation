###### Records of concern to other departments and agencies.

(g)(1) If the release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.

(2) If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.
