##### ยง 247.14 Can I hook up a campsite to on-site or off-site utilities?

(a) You must share access to all on-site facilities.

(b) Because there are a limited number of faucets available, only short-term hose use is allowed to ensure that others have access to water.

(c) You may not tap into electrical lines or outlets, or have electrical power brought in from an outside source for campsite use.
