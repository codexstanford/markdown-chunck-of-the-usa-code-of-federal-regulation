###### ยง 166.305 When is grazing capacity determined?

Before we grant, modify, or approve a permit, in consultation with the Indian landowners, we will establish the total grazing capacity for each range unit based on the summation of each parcel's productivity. We will also establish the season(s) of use on Indian lands.
