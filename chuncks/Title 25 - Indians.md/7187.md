##### ยง 900.115 How do self-determination construction contracts relate to ordinary Federal procurement contracts?

(a) A self-determination construction contract is a government-to-government agreement that transfers control of the construction project, including administrative functions, to the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization to facilitate effective and meaningful participation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in planning, conducting, and administering the construction project, and so that the construction project is responsive to the true needs of the Indian community. The Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in ยง 900.131.

(b) Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional "procurement" contracts.
