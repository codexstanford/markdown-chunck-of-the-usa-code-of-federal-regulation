###### ยง 1000.137 What funds are included in an AFA?
####### Funding Limitations.

(c)The amount of funding must be subject to the availability and level of Congressional appropriations to the bureau for that program or activity. As the various bureaus use somewhat differing budgeting practices, determining the amount of funds available for inclusion in the AFA for a particular program or activity is likely to vary among bureaus or programs.

(1) The AFA may not exceed the amount of funding the bureau would have spent for direct operations and indirect support and management of that program in that year.

(2) The AFA must not include funding for programs still performed by the bureau.
