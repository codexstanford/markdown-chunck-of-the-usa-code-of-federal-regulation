####### ยง 170.403 What TTP funds can be used for transportation planning?

Funds as defined in 23 U.S.C. 202(c) are allocated to an Indian Tribal government to carry out transportation planning. Tribes may also identify transportation planning as a priority use for their TTP Tribal share formula funds. In both cases, the fund source and use must be clearly identified on a FHWA-approved TTPTIP.
