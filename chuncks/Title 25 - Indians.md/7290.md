##### ยง 900.217 Is filing a claim under the CDA our only option for resolving post-award contract disputes?

No. The Federal government attempts to resolve all contract disputes by agreement at the awarding official's level. These are alternatives to filing a claim under the CDA:

(a) Before issuing a decision on a claim, the awarding official should consider using informal discussions between the parties, assisted by individuals who have not substantially participated in the matter, to aid in resolving differences.
