##### ยง 700.241 Request for records.
###### Categorical requests.

(d)(1) A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if (i) it can be determined which particular records are covered by the request and (ii) the records can be searched for, collected and produced without unduly burdening or interfering with Commission operations because of the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of the files.

(2) If a categorical request is determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section not to reasonably describe the records requested, the response denying the request on that ground shall specify the reasons why and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with knowledgeable Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the production of the records.
