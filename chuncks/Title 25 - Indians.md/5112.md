###### Submission of indirect cost proposal and negotiation of indirect cost rates.

4.

a. A grantee should submit its indirect cost proposal to the Federal agency which provides the largest dollar volume of contracts and grants. However, once a Federal agency has handled an indirect cost proposal, that same Federal agency should continue to act upon the proposal even though the preponderance of financial interest may have shifted to another Federal agency, and grantee shall not resubmit its indirect cost proposal to a second Federal agency.

b. Where the grantee submits its proposal to the Department of Interior, the proposal should be sent by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the cognizant Regional Office of the Department's Office of Audit and Investigation. The Office of Audit and Investigation is responsible for the audit and review of the proposals and negotiation of the indirect cost rates.

c. Grant administrators officers will usually, but are not required to, accept indirect cost rates negotiated by other Federal agencies.

d. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will provide technical assistance in developing indirect cost proposals, if needed.
