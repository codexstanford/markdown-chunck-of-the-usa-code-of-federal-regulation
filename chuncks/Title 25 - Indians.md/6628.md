(c)The Commission will attempt to meet with the owner or his/her representative to discuss its offer to purchase his/her property including the basis for the determination of fair market value and explain acquisition policies and procedures, including payment of incidental expenses. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to present material which he/she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Commission shall consider the owner's presentation.

(d) If the condition of the property indicates the need for a new appraisal or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the latest appraisal of the property, the Commission shall have the appraisal updated or obtain a new appraisal. If a new appraisal is for a lesser value than the previous appraisal and said lesser value is due to damage done to the property during the time between the two appraisals, and such damage was not caused by the owner of the improvement, the owner shall be entitled to the higher appraisal value.

(e) [Reserved]
