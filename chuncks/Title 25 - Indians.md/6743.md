###### Waiver or reduction of fees.

(c)(1) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests for records may be waived or reduced, as appropriate, if the official making the records available determines that furnishing the records can be considered as primarily benefiting the public as opposed to the requester.

(2) Fees otherwise applicable for document research and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived and not charged if the request involves:

(i) Furnishing unauthenticated copies of any documents reproduced for gratuitous distribution;

(ii) Furnishing one copy of a personal document (e.g., a birth certificate) to a person who has been required to furnish it for retention by the Commission;

(iii) Furnishing one copy of the transcript of a hearing before a hearing officer in a grievance or similar proceeding to the employee for whom the hearing was held.

(3) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived or reduced if the cost of collecting the fee would exceed the amount of the fee or if the request involves:

(i) Furnishing records to press, radio and television representatives for dissemination through the media to the general public;

(ii) Furnishing records to donors with respect to their gifts;

(iii) Furnishing records to individuals or private non-profit organizations having an official voluntary or cooperative relationship with the Commission to assist the individual or organization in its work with the Commission;

(iv) Furnishing records to state, local and tribal governments and public international organizations when to do so without charge is an appropriate courtesy, or when the recipient is carrying on a function related to that of the Commission and to do so will help to accomplish the work of the Commission;

(v) Furnishing records when to do so saves costs and yields income equal to the direct cost of providing the records (e.g., where the Commission's fee for the service would be included in a billing against the Commission);

(vi) Furnishing records when to do so is in conformance with generally established business custom (e.g., furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Commission employees);

(vii) Furnishing one copy of a record in order to assist the requester to obtain financial benefits to which he is entitled (e.g., veterans or their dependents, employees with Government employee compensation claims or persons insured by the Government).
