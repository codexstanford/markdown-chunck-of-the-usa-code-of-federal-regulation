####### ยง 162.539 Must I obtain a WEEL before obtaining a WSR lease?

You may enter into a WSR lease without a WEEL. While you may enter into a lease as a direct result of energy resource information gathered from a WEEL activity, obtaining a WEEL is not a precondition to entering into a WSR lease.
