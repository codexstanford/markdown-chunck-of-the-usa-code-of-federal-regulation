###### Collection of information.

(c)(1) Information which may be used in making determination about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from that individual.

(2) In deciding whether collection of information from an individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the following factors, among others may be considered:

(i) Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can only be obtained from a third party;

(ii) Whether the cost of collecting the information from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from a third party;

(iii) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third parties if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the individual concerned;

(iv) Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would have to be verified by a third party; or

(v) Whether provisions can be made for verification, by the individual, of information collected from third parties.
