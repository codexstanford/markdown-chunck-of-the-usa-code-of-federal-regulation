##### ยง 1000.244 May the Secretary suspend construction activities under an AFA?

(a) The Secretary may require a Tribe/Consortium to suspend certain work under a construction portion of an AFA for up to 30 days only if:

(1) Site conditions adversely affect health and safety; or

(2) Work in progress or completed fails to substantially carry out the terms of the AFA without good cause.

(b) The Secretary may suspend only work directly related to the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section unless other reasons for suspension are specifically negotiated in the AFA.

(c) Unless the Secretary determines that a health and safety emergency requiring immediate action exists, before suspending work the Secretary must provide:

(1) A 5 working days written notice; and

(2) An opportunity for the Tribe/Consortium to correct the problem.

(d) The Tribe/Consortium must be compensated for reasonable costs due to any suspension of work that occurred through no fault of the Tribe/Consortium. Project funds will not be used for this purpose. However, if suspension occurs due to the action or inaction of the Tribe/Consortium, then project funds will be used to cover suspension related activities.
