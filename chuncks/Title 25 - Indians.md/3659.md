####### Financial constraint or Fiscal constraint,See

means that a plan (metropolitan transportation plan, TTIP, or STIP) includes financial information demonstrating that projects can be implemented using committed, available, or reasonably available revenue sources, with reasonable assurance that the federally supported transportation system is adequately operated and maintained. (23 U.S.C. 134 and 135.) Documentation must be developed that demonstrates that there is a balance between the expected revenue sources for the transportation investments and the estimated costs of the projects and programs described in the planning documents.

(1) For the TTIP and the STIP, financial constraint/fiscal constraint applies to each program year.

(2) Projects in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas can be included in the first two years of the TTIP and STIP only if funds are "available" or "committed." See 23 CFR 450.104.
