Trust evaluations are normally conducted annually. When the Department receives information of a threat of imminent jeopardy to a trust asset, natural resource, or the public health and safety, the Secretary, as trustee, may conduct a preliminary investigation. If the preliminary investigation shows that appropriate, sufficient data are present to indicate there may be imminent jeopardy, the Secretary's designated representative:

(a) Will notify the Tribe/Consortium in writing; and

(b) May conduct an on-site inspection upon 2 days' advance written notice to the Tribe/Consortium.
