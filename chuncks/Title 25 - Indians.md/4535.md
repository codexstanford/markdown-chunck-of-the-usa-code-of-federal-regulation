####### ยง 224.161 How may reassumption affect the Tribe's ability to enter into a new TERA or to modify another TERA to administer additional activities or to assume administration of activities that the Secretary previously reassumed?

Following reassumption, a Tribe may submit a request to enter into a new TERA or modify another TERA to administer additional activities, or assume administration of activities that the Secretary previously reassumed. In reviewing a subsequent Tribal request, however, the Secretary may consider the fact that activities were reassumed and any change in circumstances supporting the Tribe's request.
