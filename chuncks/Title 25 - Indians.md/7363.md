(b)It is the policy of the Tribal Self-Governance Act to permanently establish and implement self-governance:

(1) To enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;

(2) To permit each Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance;

(3) To coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;

(4) To ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indian individuals;

(5) To permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities; and

(6) To provide for an orderly transition through a planned and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.
