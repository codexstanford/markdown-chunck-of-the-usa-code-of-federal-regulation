####### i.e.

(ii) Following transition, for stations in the LBS and UBS, the signal strength at any point along the licensee's GSA boundary must not exceed 47 dBµV/m. This field strength is to be measured at 1.5 meters above the ground over the channel bandwidth (, each 5.5 MHz channel for licensees that hold a full channel block, and for the 5.5 MHz channel for licensees that hold individual channels).

(iii) Following transition, for stations in the MBS, the signal strength at any point along the licensee's GSA boundary must not exceed the greater of -73.0 + 10 log(X/6) dBW/m, where X is the bandwidth in megahertz of the channel, or for facilities that are substantially similar to the licensee's pre-transition facilities (including modifications that do not alter the fundamental nature or use of the transmissions), the signal strength at such point that resulted from the station's operations immediately prior to the transition, provided that such operations complied with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
