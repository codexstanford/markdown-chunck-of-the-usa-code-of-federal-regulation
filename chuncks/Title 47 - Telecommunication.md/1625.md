(B) The licensee is not a designated entity or entrepreneur subject to unjust enrichment requirements and/or transfer restrictions under applicable Commission rules (§§ 1.2110 and 1.2111, and §§ 24.709, 24.714, and 24.839 of this chapter);

(C) The spectrum leasing arrangement does not require a waiver of, or declaratory ruling pertaining to, any applicable Commission rules; and

(D) The application does not involve a transaction in the Enhanced Competition Incentive Program (see subpart EE of this part).

(ii) A lessee of spectrum used in a Contraband Interdiction System qualifies for these immediate processing procedures if the notification is sufficiently complete and contains all necessary information and certifications (including those relating to eligibility, basic qualifications, and foreign ownership) required for notifications processed under the general notification procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, and must not require a waiver of, or declaratory ruling pertaining to, any applicable Commission rules.

(iii) Provided that the notification establishes that the proposed spectrum manager leasing arrangement meets all of the requisite elements to qualify for these immediate processing procedures, ULS will reflect that the notification has been accepted. If a qualifying notification is filed electronically, the acceptance will be reflected in ULS on the next business day after filing of the notification; if filed manually, the acceptance will be reflected in ULS on the next business day after the necessary data from the manually filed notification is entered into ULS. Once the notification has been accepted, as reflected in ULS, the spectrum lessee may commence operations under the spectrum leasing arrangement, consistent with the term of the arrangement.
