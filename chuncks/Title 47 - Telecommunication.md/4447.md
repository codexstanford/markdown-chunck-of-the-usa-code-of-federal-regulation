####### Equivalent diameter.,a,b,a,b,l,w,l,w

When circular aperture reflector antennas are employed, the size of the antenna is generally expressed as the diameter of the antenna's main reflector. When non-reflector or non-circular-aperture antennas are employed, the equivalent diameter is the diameter of a hypothetical circular-aperture antenna with the same aperture area as the actual antenna. For example, an elliptical aperture antenna with major axisand minor axiswill have an equivalent diameter of [x]. A rectangular aperture antenna with lengthand widthwill have an equivalent diameter of [4(x)/ฯ].
