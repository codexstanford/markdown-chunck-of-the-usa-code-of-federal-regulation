####### 600 MHz service band:

(i)Fixed and personal/portable devices operating in the 600 MHz Service Band must comply with the following co-channel and adjacent channel separation distances outside the defined polygonal area encompassing the base stations or other radio facilities deployed by a part 27 600 MHz Service Band licensee that has commenced operations, as defined in ยง 27.4 of this chapter.

(1) Fixed white space devices may only operate above 4 W EIRP in less congested areas as defined in ยง 15.703.

(2) If a device operates between two defined power levels, it must comply with the separation distances for the higher power level.

(3) For the purpose of this rule, co-channel means any frequency overlap between a channel used by a white space device and a five megahertz spectrum block used by a part 27 600 MHz band licensee, and adjacent channel means a frequency separation of zero to four megahertz between the edge of a channel used by a white space device and the edge of a five megahertz spectrum block used by a part 27 600 MHz band licensee.

(4) On frequencies used by wireless uplink services:

(5) On frequencies used by wireless downlink services: 35 kilometers for co-channel operation, and 31 kilometers for adjacent channel operation.
