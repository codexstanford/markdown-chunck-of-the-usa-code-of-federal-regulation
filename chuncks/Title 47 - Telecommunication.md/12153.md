(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency of more than 9.0 kHz, but no more than 15 kHz: At least 35 dB;

(3) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency of more than 15 kHz: At least 43 + 10 log (P) dB, or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
