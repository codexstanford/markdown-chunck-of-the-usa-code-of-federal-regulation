####### Emission Mask C.

(c)For transmitters that are not equipped with an audio low-pass filter, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier output power (P) as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 5 kHz, but not more than 10 kHz: At least 83 log (f/5) dB;

(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 10 kHz, but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 29 log (f/11) dB or 50 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation;

(3) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.

(4) In the 1427-1432 MHz band, licensees are encouraged to take all reasonable steps to ensure that unwanted emissions power does not exceed the following levels in the 1400-1427 MHz band:

(i) For stations of point-to-point systems in the fixed service: -45 dBW/27 MHz.

(ii) For stations in the mobile service: -60 dBW/27 MHz.
