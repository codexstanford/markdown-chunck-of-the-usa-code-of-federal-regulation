(iii) The amount of any unjust enrichment payment will be determined by the Commission as part of its review of the application under the same rules that apply in the context of a license assignment or transfer of control (§ 1.2111 and § 24.714 of this chapter). If the spectrum leasing arrangement involves only part of the license area and/or part of the bandwidth covered by the license, the unjust enrichment obligation will be apportioned as though the license were being partitioned and/or disaggregated (§ 1.2111(c) and § 24.714(c) of this chapter). A licensee will receive no reduction in its unjust enrichment payment obligation for a spectrum leasing arrangement that ends prior to the end of the fifth year of the license term.
