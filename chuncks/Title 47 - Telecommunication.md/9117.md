####### Attenuation of the unwanted sideband.

(8)The attenuation of the unwanted sideband (lower sideband) and of intermodulation products in that part of the emission spectrum shall be at least 35 dB relative to the wanted sideband signal level. However, since there is in practice a large difference between signal amplitudes in adjacent channels, a greater attenuation is recommended.
