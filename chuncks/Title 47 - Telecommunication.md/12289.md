####### Use of automatic Morse code identification equipment.

(b)Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station identification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following conditions:

(1) The signal output of the automatic identification equipment shall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any other manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted to produce 40 percent +/-10 percent of the maximum permissible modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be performed when all other modulating signals are absent.

(2) The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20 and 25 words per minute.

(3) The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification signal shall be 1200 +/-800 Hz. A licensee may be required to change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the operations of another co-channel licensee.

(4) Should activation of automatic Morse code identification equipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee, the Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay automatic station identification until such co-channel communications are completed.
