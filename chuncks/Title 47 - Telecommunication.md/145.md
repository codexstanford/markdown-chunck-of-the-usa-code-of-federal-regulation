####### § 0.459 Requests that materials or information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public inspection.
######## Procedures applicable to filings in electronic proceedings.

(2)In proceedings to which the electronic filing requirements set forth in § 1.49(f) of this chapter apply, a party seeking confidential treatment of a portion of a filing must submit in electronic format either a redacted version of the document or an affidavit that it is impossible to submit a redacted document consistent with the filing requirements of this section. Where a party demonstrates that even the fact of a filing must remain confidential, and that this is consistent with the requirements of this section, this affidavit may be filed in paper format under seal.

(3) Comments and other materials may not be submitted by means of the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) with a request for confidential treatment under this section.

(4) The Commission may use abbreviated means for indicating that the submitter of a record seeks confidential treatment, such as a checkbox enabling the submitter to indicate that the record is confidential. However, upon receipt of a request for inspection of such records pursuant to § 0.461, the submitter will be notified of such request pursuant to § 0.461(d)(3) and will be requested to justify the confidential treatment of the record, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Except as provided in § 0.459(a)(3), each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection (see § 0.457) and of the facts upon which those records are based, including:

(1) Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment is sought;

(2) Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving rise to the submission;

(3) Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged;

(4) Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that is subject to competition;

(5) Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial competitive harm;

(6) Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent unauthorized disclosure;

(7) Identification of whether the information is available to the public and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information to third parties;

(8) Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that material should not be available for public disclosure; and

(9) Any other information that the party seeking confidential treatment believes may be useful in assessing whether its request for confidentiality should be granted.

(c) Casual requests (including simply stamping pages "confidential") which do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered.

(d)(1) If a response in opposition to a confidentiality request is filed, the party requesting confidentiality may file a reply within ten business days. All responses or replies filed under this paragraph must be served on all parties.

(2) Requests which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be acted upon by the appropriate custodian of records (see § 0.461(d)(1)), who is directed to grant the request if it demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. If the request for confidentiality is granted, the ruling will be placed in the public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection.

(3) The Commission may defer acting on requests that materials or information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public inspection until a request for inspection has been made pursuant to § 0.460 or § 0.461. The information will be accorded confidential treatment, as provided for in § 0.459(g) and § 0.461, until the Commission acts on the confidentiality request and all subsequent appeal and stay proceedings have been exhausted.
