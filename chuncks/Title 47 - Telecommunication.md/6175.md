###### ยง 52.23 Deployment of long-term database methods for number portability by LECs.

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all local exchange carriers (LECs) must provide number portability in compliance with the following performance criteria:

(1) Supports network services, features, and capabilities existing at the time number portability is implemented, including but not limited to emergency services, CLASS features, operator and directory assistance services, and intercept capabilities;

(2) Efficiently uses numbering resources;

(3) Does not require end users to change their telecommunications numbers;

(4) Does not result in unreasonable degradation in service quality or network reliability when implemented;

(5) Does not result in any degradation in service quality or network reliability when customers switch carriers;

(6) Does not result in a carrier having a proprietary interest;

(7) Is able to migrate to location and service portability; and

(8) Has no significant adverse impact outside the areas where number portability is deployed.

(b)(1) All LECs must provide a long-term database method for number portability in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), as defined in ยง 52.21(k), in switches for which another carrier has made a specific request for the provision of number portability, subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) Any procedure to identify and request switches for deployment of number portability must comply with the following criteria:

(i) Any wireline carrier that is certified (or has applied for certification) to provide local exchange service in a state, or any licensed CMRS provider, must be permitted to make a request for deployment of number portability in that state;

(ii) Carriers must submit requests for deployment at least nine months before the deployment deadline for the MSA;

(iii) A LEC must make available upon request to any interested parties a list of its switches for which number portability has been requested and a list of its switches for which number portability has not been requested; and

(iv) After the deadline for deployment of number portability in an MSA in the 100 largest MSAs, according to the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part, a LEC must deploy number portability in that MSA in additional switches upon request within the following time frames:

(A) For remote switches supported by a host switch equipped for portability ("Equipped Remote Switches"), within 30 days;

(B) For switches that require software but not hardware changes to provide portability ("Hardware Capable Switches"), within 60 days;

(C) For switches that require hardware changes to provide portability ("Capable Switches Requiring Hardware"), within 180 days; and

(D) For switches not capable of portability that must be replaced ("Non-Capable Switches"), within 180 days.

(c) Beginning January 1, 1999, all LECs must make a long-term database method for number portability available within six months after a specific request by another telecommunications carrier in areas in which that telecommunications carrier is operating or plans to operate.
