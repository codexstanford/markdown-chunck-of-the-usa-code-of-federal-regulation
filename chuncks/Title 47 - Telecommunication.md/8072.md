The notification provided by the IXC to the LEC must contain the customer account information necessary to properly execute the cancellation Order including but not limited to:

(1) The customer's billing telephone number or working telephone number associated with the lines or terminals that are affected;

(2) The date of the IXC-submitted PIC removal Order;
