###### ยง 54.1809 De-enrollment from the Affordable Connectivity Program.
####### De-enrollment for failure to re-certify.

(d)Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a participating provider shall de-enroll an Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber who does not respond to the provider's attempts to obtain re-certification of the subscriber's continued eligibility as required by ยง 54.1806(f); or who fails to provide the annual one-per-household re-certification as required by ยง 54.1806(f)(6). Prior to de-enrolling a subscriber under this paragraph, the provider shall notify the subscriber in writing separate from the subscriber's monthly bill, if one is provided, using clear, easily understood language, that failure to respond to the re-certification request will trigger de-enrollment. A subscriber shall be given 60 days to respond to recertification efforts. If a subscriber does not respond to the provider's notice of impending de-enrollment, the provider shall de-enroll the subscriber from the Affordable Connectivity Program within five business days after the expiration of the subscriber's time to respond to the re-certification efforts.
