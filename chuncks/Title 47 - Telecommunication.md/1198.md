######## e.g.,

(c) The Commission shall assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts, unless otherwise prohibited by statute. The calculation of administrative costs may be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined by the Commission. Commission administrative costs include the personnel and service costs (telephone, copier, and overhead) to notify and collect the debt, without regard to the success of such efforts by the Commission.

(d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the Commission will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), currently not to exceed six percent (6%) a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency. If the rate permitted under 31 U.S.C. 3717 is changed, the Commission will apply that rate.
