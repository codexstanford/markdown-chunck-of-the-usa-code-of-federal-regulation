###### ยง 27.53 Emission limits.
####### Measurement procedure.,i.e.,

(5)Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the channel blocks at 2305, 2310, 2315, 2320, 2345, 2350, 2355, and 2360 MHz, a resolution bandwidth of at least 1 percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (1 MHz). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.

(6) [Reserved]

(7) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the transmitter power;

(8) Waiver requests of any of the out-of-band emission limits in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section shall be entertained only if interference protection equivalent to that afforded by the limits is shown;

(9) [Reserved]

(10) The out-of-band emissions limits in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section may be modified by the private contractual agreement of all affected licensees, who must maintain a copy of the agreement in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees, transferees, or spectrum lessees and, upon request, to the Commission.
