####### ยง 0.459 Requests that materials or information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public inspection.
######## i.e.

(e) If the materials are submitted voluntarily (, absent any requirement by statute, regulation, or the Commission), the person submitting them may request the Commission to return the materials without consideration if the request for confidentiality should be denied. In that event, the materials will ordinarily be returned (e.g., an application will be returned if it cannot be considered on a confidential basis). Only in the unusual instance where the public interest so requires will the materials be made available for public inspection. However, no materials submitted with a request for confidentiality will be returned if a request for inspection has been filed under ยง 0.461. If submission of the materials is required by the Commission and the request for confidentiality is denied, the materials will be made available for public inspection once the period for review of the denial has passed.
