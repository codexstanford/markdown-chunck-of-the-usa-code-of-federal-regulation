##### Limitations.

d.Priority levels will be assigned only to the minimum number of telecommunication services required to support an NSEP function. Priority levels will not normally be assigned to back-up services on a continuing basis, absent additional justification (e.g., a service user specifies a requirement for physically diverse routing or contracts for additional continuity-of-service features). The Executive Office of the President may also establish limitations upon the relative numbers of services which may be assigned any restoration priority level. These limitations will not take precedence over laws or executive orders. Such limitations shall not be exceeded absent waiver by the Executive Office of the President.
