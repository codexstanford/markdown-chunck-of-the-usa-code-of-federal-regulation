####### Channel pairing.

(e)In general, channels must be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs that are separated by 30 MHz. However, until December 31, 2006, channels other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1), may be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs having a different separation, where necessary because 30 MHz base/mobile pairing is precluded by the presence of one or more co-channel or adjacent channel TV/DTV broadcast stations.
