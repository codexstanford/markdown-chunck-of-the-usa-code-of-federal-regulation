####### Power flux density (PFD).

The amount of power flow through a unit area within a unit bandwidth. The units of power flux density are those of power spectral density per unit area, namely watts per hertz per square meter. These units are generally expressed in decibel form as dB(W/Hz/m), dB(W/m) in a 4 kHz band, or dB(W/m) in a 1 MHz band.
