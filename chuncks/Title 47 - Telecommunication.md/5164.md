####### Earth station filtering.

(5)A passband filter must be installed at the site of each incumbent earth station at the same time or after it has been migrated to new frequencies to block signals from adjacent channels and to prevent harmful interference from licensees in the 3.7 GHz Service. Earth station filtering can occur either simultaneously with, or after, the earth station migration, or can occur at any point after the earth station migration so long as all affected earth stations in a given Partial Economic Area and surrounding areas are filtered prior to a licensee in the 3.7 GHz Service commencing operations.
