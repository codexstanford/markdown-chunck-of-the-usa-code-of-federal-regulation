###### § 1.1305 Actions which normally will have a significant impact upon the environment, for which Environmental Impact Statements must be prepared.
####### see

Any Commission action deemed to have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment requires the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (collectively referred to as EISs) (§§ 1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317). The Commission has reviewed representative actions and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify actions that will thus automatically require EISs.
