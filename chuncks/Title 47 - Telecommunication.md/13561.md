####### Hub transmitter EIRP spectral area, density limit.

(2)LMDS applicants shall demonstrate that, under clear air operating conditions, the maximum aggregate of LMDS transmitting hub stations in a Basic Trading Area in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band will not transmit a co-frequency hub-to-subscriber e.i.r.p. spectral area density in any azimuthal direction in excess of X dBW/(MHz-km) when averaged over any 4.375 MHz band, where X is defined in Table 1. Individual hub stations may exceed their clear air e.i.r.p.s by employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

(i) The e.i.r.p. aggregate spectral area density is calculated as follows:

(ii) The climate zones in Table 1 are defined for different geographic locations within the US as shown in Appendix 28 of the ITU Radio Regulations.
