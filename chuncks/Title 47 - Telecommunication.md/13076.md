####### Attenuation requirements.

(b)The power of unwanted emissions must be attenuated below the transmitter output power in Watts (P) by at least:

(1) 7.27(f-2.88 kHz) dB on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) that is more than 5.625 kHz, but not more than 12.5 kHz.

(2) 50 + 10 log (P) dB or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation, on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by more than 12.5 kHz.

(3) 25 dB on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by more than 10 kHz, but not more than 20 kHz.

(4) 35 dB on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by more than 20 kHz, but not more than 50 kHz.

(5) 83 log (f&#xF7; 5) dB on any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) that is more than 5 kHz, but not more than 10 kHz.

(6) 29 log (f&#xF7; 11) dB or 50 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) that is more than 10 kHz, but not more than 50 kHz.

(7) 43 + 10 log(P) dB on any frequency removed from the channel center frequency by more than 50 kHz.
