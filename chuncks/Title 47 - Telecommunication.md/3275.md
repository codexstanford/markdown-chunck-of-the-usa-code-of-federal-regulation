####### Maximum Conducted Output Power.,e.g.,,maximum conducted output power

The total transmit power delivered to all antennas and antenna elements averaged across all symbols in the signaling alphabet when the transmitter is operating at its maximum power control level. Power must be summed across all antennas and antenna elements. The average must not include any time intervals during which the transmitter is off or is transmitting at a reduced power level. If multiple modes of operation are possible (alternative modulation methods), theis the highest total transmit power occurring in any mode.
