(a) All issuing carriers that file applications for special permission, associated documents, such as transmittal letters, requests for special permission, and supporting information, shall file those documents electronically.

(b) Applications for special permission must contain:

(2) A statement citing the specific rules and the grounds on which waiver is sought;

(3) A showing of good cause; and

(4) The appropriate Illustrative tariff pages the issuing carrier wishes to either revise or add as new pages to its tariff.

If the transmission ends after the close of a business day, as that term is defined in ยง 1.4(e)(2) of this chapter, the filing will be date and time stamped as of the opening of the next business day.
