(h)(1) Each broadcast television station licensee that is a party to a CSA shall continue to be licensed and operated separately, have its own call sign, and be separately subject to all of the Commission's obligations, rules, and policies applicable to the television service.

(2) Upon termination of the license of a party to a CSA, the spectrum usage rights covered by that license may revert to the remaining parties to the CSA.
