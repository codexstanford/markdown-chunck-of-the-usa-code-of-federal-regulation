###### ยง 78.19 Interference.

(a) Applications for CARS stations shall endeavor to select an assignable frequency or frequencies which will be least likely to result in interference to other licensees in the same area since the FCC itself does not undertake frequency coordination.

(b) Applicants for CARS stations shall take full advantage of all known techniques, such as the geometric arrangement of transmitters and receivers, the use of minimum power required to provide the needed service, and the use of highly directive transmitting and receiving antenna systems, to prevent interference to the reception of television STL, television intercity relay, and other CARS stations.
