(iv) A licensee that participates in the Commission's installment payment program (ยง 1.2110(g)) may enter into a long-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement without triggering unjust enrichment obligations provided that the lessee would qualify for as favorable a category of installment payments. A licensee using installment payment financing that seeks to lease to an entity not meeting the eligibility standards for as favorable a category of installment payments must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest accrued through the effective date of the spectrum leasing arrangement (ยง 1.2111(a)). This requirement applies regardless of whether the licensee is leasing all or a portion of its bandwidth and/or license area.
