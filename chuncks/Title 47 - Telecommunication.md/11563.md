###### § 80.905 Vessel radio equipment.

(a) Vessels subject to part III of title III of the Communications Act that operate in the waters described in § 80.901 must, at a minimum, be equipped as follows:

(1) Vessels operated solely within 20 nautical miles of land must be equipped with a VHF-DSC radiotelephone installation meeting the requirements of § 80.1101(c)(2), except that a VHF radiotelephone installation without DSC capability is permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A1 coverage is established. Vessels in this category must not operate more than 20 nautical miles from land.

(2) Vessels operated beyond the 20 nautical mile limitation specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but not more than 100 nautical miles from the nearest land, must be equipped with a MF-DSC frequency transmitter meeting the requirements of § 80.1101(c)(3) and capable of transmitting J3E emission and a receiver capable of reception of J3E emission within the band 1710 to 2850 kHz, in addition to the VHF-DSC radiotelephone installation required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that a MF radiotelephone installation without DSC capability is permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A2 coverage is established. The MF or MF-DSC transmitter and receiver must be capable of operation on 2670 kHz.

(3) Vessels operated more than 100 nautical miles but not more than 200 nautical miles from the nearest land must:

(i) Be equipped with a VHF-DSC radiotelephone installation meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that a VHF radiotelephone installation without DSC capability is permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A1 coverage is established;

(ii) Be equipped with an MF-DSC radiotelephone transmitter and receiver meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that a MF radiotelephone installation without DSC capability is permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A2 coverage is established; and

(iii) Be equipped with either:

(A) A DSC-capable single sideband radiotelephone meeting the requirements of § 80.1101(c)(4) and capable of operating on all distress and safety frequencies in the medium frequency and high frequency bands listed in § 80.369(a) and (b), on all of the ship-to-shore calling frequencies in the high frequency bands listed in § 80.369(d), and on at least four of the automated mutual-assistance vessel rescue (AMVER) system HF duplex channels (this requirement may be met by the addition of such frequencies to the radiotelephone installation required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section); or

(B) If operated in an area within the coverage of an INMARSAT maritime mobile geostationary satellite in which continuous alerting is available, a GMDSS-approved Inmarsat ship earth station.

(iv) Be equipped with a reserve power supply meeting the requirements of §§ 80.917(b), 80.919 and 80.921, and capable of powering the single sideband radiotelephone or the ship earth station (including associated peripheral equipment) required by paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, including the navigation receiver referred to in § 80.905(a)(5);
