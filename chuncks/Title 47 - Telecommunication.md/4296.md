######## Licensed PCS.

(a)The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine if a PCS entity preparing to initiate operations must pay a PCS relocator or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in accordance with the formula detailed in ยง 24.243:

(1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-channel with the licensed PCS band(s) of the subsequent PCS entity;

(2) A PCS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the microwave incumbent; and

(3) The subsequent PCS entity is preparing to turn on a fixed base station at commercial power and the fixed base station is located within a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) described as follows:

(i) The length of the rectangle shall be x where x is a line extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall be y where y is a line perpendicular to x and extending for a distance of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of x. Thus, the rectangle is represented as follows:

(ii) If the application of the Proximity Threshold test indicates that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and notify the subsequent PCS entity of the total amount of its reimbursement obligation.
