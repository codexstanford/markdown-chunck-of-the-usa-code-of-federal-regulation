(1)(i) Within Lines A, B, C, and D, as defined in ยง 1.928(e) of this chapter, along the U.S./Canada border, U.S. stations operating in the 932.0-932.25 MHz and 941.0-941.25 MHz bands are on a secondary basis and may operate provided that they shall not transmit a power flux density (PFD) at the border greater than -100 dBW/mnor -94 dBW/m, respectively. The U.S. has full use of the frequencies in these regions up to the border in the bands 932.25-932.50 MHz and 941.25-941.50 MHz, and Canadian stations may operate on a secondary basis provided they do not exceed the respective PFDs shown above. PFD can be determined using the following formula: PFD (dBW/m) = 10 log [EIRP/4ฯ(D], where EIRP is in watts, D is in meters, and the power is relative to an isotropic radiator. The technical parameters are also limited by tables 1 and 2:

(ii) Maximum antenna height above average terrain for master stations operating at a maximum power shall not exceed 150 meters. Above 150 meters, the power of master stations shall be in accordance with following table:
