####### Deletion of channels.

(4)When dropping a channel from a BST or CPST, operators shall reflect the net reduction in external costs in their rates pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section, or paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. With respect to channels to which the 7.5% mark-up on programming costs applied pursuant to paragraph (f)(8) of this section, the operator shall treat the mark-up as part of its programming costs and subtract the mark-up from its external costs. Operators shall also reduce the price of that tier by the "residual" associated with that channel. For channels that were on a BST or CPST on May 14, 1994, or channels added after that date pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the per channel residual is the charge for their tier, minus the external costs for the tier, and any per channel adjustments made after that date, divided by the total number of channels on the tier minus the number of channels on the tier that received the per channel adjustment specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For channels added to a CPST after May 14, 1994, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the residuals shall be the actual per channel adjustment taken for that channel when it was added to the tier.
