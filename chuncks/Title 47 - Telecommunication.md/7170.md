(d)(1) Price Cap CMT Revenue (as defined in § 61.3(cc)) per month as of July 1, 2000 (adjusted to remove Universal Service Contributions assessed to local exchange carriers pursuant to § 54.702 of this chapter) using 2000 annual filing base period demand, divided by the 2000 annual filing base period demand. In filing entities with multiple study areas, if it becomes necessary to calculate the Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month for a specific study area, then the Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month for that study area is determined as follows, using base period demand revenues (adjusted to remove Universal Service Contributions assessed to Local Exchange Carriers pursuant to § 54.702 of this chapter), Base Factor Portion (BFP) and 2000 annual filing base period lines:

Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line Month in a study area = Price Cap CMT Revenue x (BFP in the study area &#xF7; (BFP in the Filing Entity) &#xF7; (Lines in the study area.

(2) Nothing in this definition precludes a price cap local exchange carrier from continuing to average rates across filing entities containing multiple study areas, where permitted under existing rules.

(3) Average Price Cap CMT Revenues per Line month may be adjusted after July 1, 2000 to reflect exogenous costs pursuant to § 61.45(d).

(4) Average Price Cap CMT Revenues per Line month may also be adjusted pursuant to § 61.45 (b)(1)(iii).
