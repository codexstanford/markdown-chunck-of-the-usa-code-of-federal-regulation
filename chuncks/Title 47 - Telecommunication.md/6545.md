(5)Before funding year 2026 and every subsequent five-year funding cycle, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall announce the multipliers and funding floor as adjusted for inflation at least 60 days before the start of the filing window for the next five-year funding cycle. The Bureau shall use the last four quarters of data on the Gross Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI) compared with the equivalent quarters from the beginning of the five-year funding cycle. The increase shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent and shall be used to calculate the category two budget multipliers and funding floor for that five-year funding cycle. The multipliers and funding floor shall be rounded to the nearest cent.
