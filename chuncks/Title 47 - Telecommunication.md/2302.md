However, the identification shall not be of a format which could be confused with the FCC Identifier required on certified equipment. The responsible party shall maintain adequate identification records to facilitate positive identification for each device.

(b) Devices subject to authorization under Supplier's Declaration of Conformity may be labeled with the following logo on a voluntary basis as a visual indication that the product complies with the applicable FCC requirements.
