###### ยง 2.102 Assignment of frequencies.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the assignment of frequencies and frequency bands to all stations and classes of stations and the licensing and authorizing of the use of all such frequencies between 8.3 kHz and 275 GHz, and the actual use of such frequencies for radiocommunication or for any other purpose, including the transfer of energy by radio, shall be in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations in ยง 2.106.

(b) On the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to services operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations the following exceptions to paragraph (a) of this section may be authorized:

(1) In individual cases the Commission may, without rule making proceedings, authorize on a temporary basis only, the use of frequencies not in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations for projects of short duration or emergencies where the Commission finds that important or exceptional circumstances require such utilization. Such authorizations are not intended to develop a service to be operated on frequencies other than those allocated such service.

(2) [Reserved]

(3) Experimental stations, pursuant to part 5 of this chapter, may be authorized the use of any frequency or frequency band not exclusively allocated to the passive services (including the radio astronomy service).

(4) In the event a band is reallocated so as to delete its availability for use by a particular service, the Commission may provide for the further interim use of the band by stations in that service for a temporary, specific period of time.

(c) Non-Federal stations may be authorized to use Federal frequencies in the bands above 25 MHz:

(1) If the Commission finds, after consultations with the appropriate Federal agency or agencies, that such use is necessary for coordination of Federal and non-Federal activities. Such operations must meet the following requirements:

(i) Non-Federal operation on Federal frequencies shall conform with the conditions agreed upon by the Commission and NTIA;

(ii) Such operations shall be in accordance with NTIA rules governing the service to which the frequencies involved are allocated;

(iii) Such operations shall not cause harmful interference to Federal stations and, should harmful interference result, that the interfering non-Federal operation shall immediately terminate; and

(iv) Non-Federal operation has been certified as necessary by the Federal agency involved and this certification has been furnished, in writing, to the non-Federal licensee with which communication is required; or

(2) Pursuant to the provisions of ยง 90.25 of this chapter, provided that such operations shall not cause harmful interference to Federal stations and, should harmful interference result, that the interfering non-Federal operation shall immediately terminate.
