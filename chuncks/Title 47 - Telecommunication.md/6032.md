###### § 51.915 Recovery mechanism for price cap carriers.
####### 3

() For the purpose of establishing its recovery for net reciprocal compensation, a Price Cap Carrier may elect to forgo this step and receive no recovery for reductions in net reciprocal compensation. If a carrier elects this option, it may not change its election at a later date.

(iii) Beginning July 1, 2014, a Price Cap Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the CALLS Study Area Base Factor and/or the Non-CALLS Study Area Base Factor, as applicable, multiplied by the sum of the amounts in paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)(A) through (d)(1)(iii)(E), of this section, and then adding the amount in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F) of this section to that amount:

(A) The amount of the reduction in Transitional Intrastate Access Service revenues determined pursuant to § 51.907(b)(2) and (c) multiplied by the Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor; and

(B) The reduction in interstate switched access revenues equal to the difference between the 2011 Baseline Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate and the 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate determined pursuant to § 51.907(d) using Fiscal Year 2011 terminating interstate end office switching minutes, and then multiply by the Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor;

(C) If the carrier reduced its 2014 Intrastate Terminating End Office Access Rate(s) pursuant to § 51.907(d)(2), the reduction in revenues equal to the difference between either the Intrastate 2014 Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate and the Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate based on the maximum terminating end office rates that could have been charged on July 1, 2014, or the 2014 Target Composite Terminating End Office Access Rate, as applicable, using Fiscal Year 2011 terminating intrastate end office switching minutes, and then multiply by the Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor;

(D) CMRS Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues multiplied by the Price Cap Carrier Traffic Demand Factor; and

(E) A Price Cap Carrier's cumulative reductions in Fiscal Year 2011 net reciprocal compensation revenues other than those associated with CMRS traffic as described in § 51.701(b)(2) resulting from rate reductions required by § 51.705 may be calculated in one of the following ways:
