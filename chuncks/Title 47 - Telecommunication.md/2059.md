####### Out-of-band domain (of an emission).

The frequency range, immediately outside the necessary bandwidth but excluding the spurious domain, in which out-of-band emissions generally predominate. Out-of-band emissions, defined based on their source, occur in the out-of-band domain and, to a lesser extent, in the spurious domain. Spurious emissions likewise may occur in the out-of-band domain as well as in the spurious domain. (RR)
