###### ยง 73.3801 Full power television simulcasting during the ATSC 3.0 (Next Gen TV) transition.
####### Simulcasting requirement.

(b)A full power television station that chooses to air an ATSC 3.0 signal must simulcast the primary video programming stream of that signal in an ATSC 1.0 format. This requirement does not apply to any multicast streams aired on the ATSC 3.0 channel.

(1) The programming aired on the ATSC 1.0 simulcast signal must be "substantially similar" to that aired on the ATSC 3.0 primary video programming stream. For purposes of this section, "substantially similar" means that the programming must be the same except for advertisements, promotions for upcoming programs, and programming features that are based on the enhanced capabilities of ATSC 3.0. These enhanced capabilities include:

(i) Hyper-localized content (e.g., geo-targeted weather, targeted emergency alerts, and hyper-local news):

(ii) Programming features or improvements created for the ATSC 3.0 service (e.g., emergency alert "wake up" ability and interactive program features);

(iii) Enhanced formats made possible by ATSC 3.0 technology (e.g., 4K or HDR); and

(iv) Personalization of programming performed by the viewer and at the viewer's discretion.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, programming that airs at a different time on the ATSC 1.0 simulcast signal than on the primary video programming stream of the ATSC 3.0 signal is not considered "substantially similar."

(3) The "substantially similar" requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will sunset on July 17, 2023.
