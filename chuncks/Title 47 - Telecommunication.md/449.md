######## Action by the presiding officer.

(d)If the presiding officer determines that an objection is not justified, he shall order that the answer be served. If an interrogatory has not been answered, the presiding officer may rule that the right to object has been waived and may order that an answer be served. If an answer does not comply fully with the requirements of this section, the presiding officer may order that an amended answer be served, may specify the scope and detail of the matters to be covered by the amended answer, and may specify any appropriate procedural consequences (including adverse findings of fact and dismissal with prejudice) which will follow from the failure to make a full and responsive answer. If a full and responsive answer is not made, the presiding officer may issue an order invoking any of the procedural consequences specified in the order to compel an answer.
