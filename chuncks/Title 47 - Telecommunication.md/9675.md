(c)If a licensee or permittee that utilizes a new entrant bidding credit under this subsection seeks to assign or transfer control of its license or construction permit to an entity not meeting the eligibility criteria for the bidding credit, the licensee or permittee must reimburse the U.S. Government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations applicable on the date the construction permit was originally granted, as a condition of Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. If a licensee or permittee that utilizes a new entrant bidding credit seeks to assign or transfer control of a license or construction permit to an entity that is eligible for a lower bidding credit, the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify, plus interest based on the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations applicable on the date the construction permit was originally granted, must be paid to the U.S. Government as a condition of Commission approval of the assignment or transfer. The amount of the reimbursement payments will be reduced over time. An assignment or transfer in the first two years after issuance of the construction permit to the winning bidder will result in a forfeiture of one hundred (100) percent of the value of the bidding credit; during year three, of seventy-five (75) percent of the value of the bidding credit; in year four, of fifty (50) percent; in year five, twenty-five (25) percent; and thereafter, no payment. If a licensee or permittee who utilized a new entrant bidding credit in obtaining a broadcast license or construction permit acquires within this five-year reimbursement period an additional broadcast facility or facilities, such that the licensee or permittee would not have been eligible for the new entrant credit, the licensee or permittee will generally not be required to reimburse the U.S. Government for the amount of the bidding credit.
