####### Initiation, timing, and affirmative concurrence.

(d)A 3.45 GHz Service licensee must initiate a formal coordination request through the online portal provided by the Department of Defense. Unless otherwise agreed between a 3.45 GHz Service licensee and the relevant Federal incumbent(s), no formal coordination requests may be submitted until nine (9) months after the date of the auction closing Public Notice. 3.45 GHz Service licensees may request informal discussions (through the point of contact identified in the applicable Transition Plan) during this nine-month time period. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the requirement to reach a coordination arrangement is satisfied only by obtaining the affirmative concurrence of the relevant Federal incumbent(s) via the portal. The requirement of this paragraph (d) is not satisfied by omission.
