(3) For purposes of determining whether interference is caused to a DTV station's service area, the maximum technical facilities,antenna height above average terrain (antenna HAAT) and effective radiated power (ERP), specified for the station's allotment are to be used in determining its service area.

(f)(1) [Reserved]

(2) An application for authority to construct or modify DTV facilities will not be subject to further consideration of electromagnetic interference to other DTV or analog TV broadcast stations, allotments or applications, provided that:

(i) The proposed ERP in each azimuthal direction is equal to or less than the reference ERP in that direction; and

(ii) The proposed antenna HAAT is equal to or less than the reference antenna HAAT or the proposed antenna HAAT exceeds the reference antenna HAAT by 10 meters or less and the reference ERP in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and

(iii) The application complies with the location provisions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(3)(i) A DTV station may increase its antenna HAAT by up to 10 meters from that specified in Appendix B if it reduces its DTV power to a level at or below the level of adjusted DTV power computed in the following formula:

(ii) Alternatively, a DTV application that specifies an antenna HAAT within 25 meters below that specified in Appendix B may adjust its power upward to a level at or below the adjusted DTV power in accordance with the formula in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section without an interference showing. For a proposed antenna more than 25 meters below the reference antenna HAAT, the DTV station may increase its ERP up to the level permitted for operation with an antenna that is 25 meters below the station's reference antenna HAAT.

(4) UHF DTV stations may request an increase in power, up to a maximum of 1000 kW ERP, to enhance service within their authorized service area.
