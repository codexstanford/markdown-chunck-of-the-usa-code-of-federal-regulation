## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Appendix B to Part 1 - Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas
###### i.e.,

b. The antenna that is part of the collocation fits within an enclosure (or if the antenna is exposed, within an imaginary enclosureone that would be the correct size to contain the equipment) that is no more than three cubic feet in volume; and,

c. The antenna is installed using stealth techniques that match or complement the structure on which or within which it is deployed;

3. The antenna's associated equipment is not visible from:

a. The ground level anywhere in a historic district (if the antenna is located inside or within 250 feet of the boundary of a historic district); or,

b. Immediately adjacent streets or public spaces at ground level (if the antenna is on a historic property that is not in a historic district); or,

c. Public spaces within the building (if the antenna is mounted in the interior of a building).

4. The facilities (including antenna(s) and associated equipment identified in the definition of Antenna in Stipulation I.A.) are installed in a way that does not damage historic materials and permits removal of such facilities without damaging historic materials;

5. The depth and width of any proposed ground disturbance associated with the collocation does not exceed the depth and width of any previous ground disturbance (including footings and other anchoring mechanisms). Up to four lightning grounding rods of no more than three-quarters of an inch in diameter may be installed per project, regardless of the extent of previous ground disturbance; and

6. The collocation licensee or the owner of the building or non-tower structure has not received written or electronic notification that the FCC is in receipt of a complaint from a member of the public, an Indian Tribe, a SHPO or the Council, that the collocation has an adverse effect on one or more historic properties. Any such complaint must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence describing how the effect from the collocation is adverse to the attributes that qualify any affected historic property for eligibility or potential eligibility for the National Register.

B. A small antenna (including associated equipment included in the definition of Antenna in Stipulation I.A.) may be mounted on a utility pole or electric transmission tower (but not including light poles, lamp posts, and other structures whose primary purpose is to provide public lighting) that is in active use by a utility company (as defined in Section 224 of the Communications Act) or by a cooperatively-owned, municipal, or other governmental agency and is either: (1) A historic property (including a property listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places); (2) located on a historic property (including a property listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places); or (3) located inside or within 250 feet of the boundary of a historic district, without being reviewed through the Section 106 process set forth in the NPA, provided that:

1. The utility pole or electric transmission tower on which the equipment will be deployed is not located on a designated National Historic Landmark;
