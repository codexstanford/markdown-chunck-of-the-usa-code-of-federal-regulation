######## Registration of reimbursement rights.

(a)Claims for reimbursement under the cost-sharing plan are limited to relocation expenses incurred on or after the date when the first AWS license is issued in the relevant AWS band (start date). If a clearinghouse is not selected by that date (see § 27.1162) claims for reimbursement (see § 27.1166) and notices of operation (see § 27.1170) for activities that occurred after the start date but prior to the clearinghouse selection must be submitted to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the selection date.

(1) To obtain reimbursement, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent. In the case of involuntary relocation, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of the relocated system within 30 calendar days after the end of the relocation.

(2) To obtain reimbursement, a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must submit documentation of the relocation of the link to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date that the incumbent notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to § 101.305 of the Commission's rules.
