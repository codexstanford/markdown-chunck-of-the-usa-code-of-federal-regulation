(1) Use of broadcast auxiliary service frequencies below 470 MHz is limited to areas of the United States south of Line A or west of Line C unless the effective radiated power of the station is 5 watts or less.ยง 1.928(e) of this chapter for a definition of Line A and Line C.

(2) A broadcast auxiliary service station operating on frequencies between 470 MHz and 1 GHz must be at least 56.3 kilometers (35 miles) south (or west, as appropriate of the United States-Canada border if the antenna looks within a 200&#xB0; sector toward the border; or, the station must be at least 8.1 kilometers (5 miles) south (or west, as appropriate) if the antenna looks within a 160&#xB0; sector away from the border. However, operation is not permitted in either of these two situations if the station would be within the coordination distance of a receiving earth station in Canada which uses the same frequency band. (The coordination distance is the distance, calculated for any station, according to Appendix 28 of the International Radio Regulations.)

(3) A broadcast auxiliary service station operating on frequencies above 1 GHz shall not be located within the coordination distance of a receiving earth station in Canada which uses the same frequency band. (The coordination distance is the distance, calculated for any station, according to Appendix 28 of the international Radio Regulations.)

(i) Short-term operation of a remote pickup broadcast base station, a remote pickup automatic relay station, an aural broadcast STL station, an aural broadcast intercity relay station, a TV STL station, a TV intercity relay station or a TV translator relay station in the National Radio Quiet Zone, the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, or near FCC monitoring stations is subject to the same advance notification procedures applicable to regular applications as provided for in ยง 73.1030 of this chapter and ยง 74.12, except that inasmuch as short-term operation does not involve an application process, the provisions relating to agency objection procedures shall not apply. It shall simply be necessary for the licensee to contact the potentially affected agency and obtain advance approval for the proposed short-term operation. Where protection to FCC monitoring stations is concerned, approval for short-term operation may be given by the Regional Director of a Commission field facility.
