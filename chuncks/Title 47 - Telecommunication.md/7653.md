####### TRS User Registration Database Information Requirements for VRS.

(4)Each VRS provider shall collect and transmit to the TRS User Registration Database, in a format prescribed by the administrator of the TRS User Registration Database, the following information for each of its new and existing registered internet-based TRS users: Full name; address; ten-digit telephone number assigned in the TRS numbering directory; last four digits of the social security number or Tribal Identification number, if the registered internet-based TRS user is a member of a Tribal nation and does not have a social security number; date of birth; Registered Location; VRS provider name and dates of service initiation and termination; a digital copy of the user's self-certification of eligibility for VRS and the date obtained by the provider; the date on which the user's identification was verified; and (for existing users only) the date on which the registered internet-based TRS user last placed a point-to-point or relay call.

(i) Each VRS provider must obtain, from each new and existing registered internet-based TRS user, consent to transmit the registered internet-based TRS user's information to the TRS User Registration Database. Prior to obtaining consent, the VRS provider must describe to the registered internet-based TRS user, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the TRS User Registration Database to ensure proper administration of the TRS program, and that failure to provide consent will result in the registered internet-based TRS user being denied service. VRS providers must obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgment by every registered internet-based TRS user of such consent.

(ii) VRS providers must, for existing registered internet-based TRS users, submit the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information. Calls from or to existing registered internet-based TRS users that have not had their information populated in the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information shall not be compensable.

(iii) VRS providers must submit the information in the introductory text of paragraph (a)(4) of this section upon initiation of service for users registered after 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information. VRS providers may provide service to such users for up to two weeks after the user's registration information has been submitted to the TRS User Registration Database pending verification of the user's identity. After the user's identity is verified by the Database administrator, VRS providers may seek TRS Fund compensation for calls handled during such pre-verification period of up to two weeks.

(iv) If a VRS user's registration data submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section is not verified by the TRS User Registration Database administrator within two weeks after submission, the VRS provider shall hold the assigned number for up to 30 days or the pendency of an appeal, whichever is later, pending the outcome of any further efforts to complete verification, before returning the number to inactive status or assigning it to another user. If a VRS user's identity is verified within such 30-day period, or during the pendency of an appeal, whichever is later, the administrator may enter the number into the Database (and the TRS Numbering Directory) as assigned to that user.
