6.

a. Any participating Federal entity will accept, to the extent that acceptance does not interfere with the mission responsibilities of the entity, emergency messages of other Federal entities, or other components of the same entity, for transmission by HF radio to the addressee or to another participant for relay to the addressee.

b. A SHARES message is an emergency message to be sent via the SHARES network. It consists of information that must be communicated to a Federal entity and is of critical importance to the Federal Government, the entity's mission, and/or involves the preservation of life and the protection of property.

c. Transmission of SHARES messages will be guided by the policy of the agency accepting the message. Advice that a "SHARES Message" is to be transmitted will serve to notify operating personnel that a critical NSEP message requirement exists, and implicitly, that normal communication paths are not available.
