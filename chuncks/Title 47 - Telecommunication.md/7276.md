####### Average Traffic Sensitive Revenues.

(l)(1) In the July 1, 2000 annual filing, price cap local exchange carriers will make an additional reduction to rates comprising ATS charge, and to associated SBI upper limits and PCIs. This reduction will be calculated to be the amount that would be necessary to achieve a total $2.1 billion reduction in carrier common line and ATS rates by all price cap local exchange carriers, compared with those rates as they existed on June 30, 2000 using 2000 annual filing base period demand.

(i) The net change in revenue associated with Carrier Common Line Rate elements resulting from:

(A) The removal from access of price cap local exchange carrier contributions to the Federal universal service mechanisms;

(B) Price cap local exchange carrier receipts of interstate access universal service support pursuant to subpart J of part 54;

(C) Changes in End User Common Line Charges and PICC rates;

(D) Changes in Carrier Common Line charges due to GDP-PI - X targeting for $0.0095 filing entities.

(ii) Reductions in Average Traffic Sensitive charges resulting from:

(A) Targeting of the application of the (GDP-PI - X) portion of the formula in ยง 61.45(b), and any applicable "g" adjustments;

(B) The removal from access of price cap local exchange carrier contributions to the Federal universal service mechanisms;

(C) Additional ATS charge reductions defined in paragraph (2) of this section.

(2) Once the reductions in paragraph (l)(1)(i) and paragraphs (l)(1)(ii)(A) and (l)(1)(ii)(B) of this section are identified, the difference between those reductions and $2.1 billion is the total amount of additional reductions that would be made to ATS rates of price cap local exchange carriers. This amount will then be restated as the percentage of total price cap local exchange carrier Local Switching revenues as of June 30, 2000 using 2000 annual filing base period demand ("June 30 Local Switching revenues") necessary to yield the total amount of additional reductions and taking into account the fact that, if participating, a price cap local exchange carrier would not reduce ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in ยง 61.3(qq).Each price cap local exchange carrier then reduces ATS rate elements, and associated SBI upper limits and PCIs, by a dollar amount equivalent to the percentage times the June 30 Local Switching revenues for that filing entity, provided that no price cap local exchange carrier shall be required to reduce its ATS rates below its Target Rate as set forth in ยง 61.3(qq). Each price cap local exchange carrier can take its additional reductions against any of the ATS rate elements, provided that at least a proportional share must be taken against Local Switching rates.
