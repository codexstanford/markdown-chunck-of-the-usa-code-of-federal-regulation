####### Area code relief.

(b)The term "area code relief" refers to the process by which central office codes are made available when there are few or no unassigned central office codes remaining in an existing area code and a new area code is introduced. Area code relief includes planning for area code "jeopardy," which is a situation where central office codes may become exhausted before an area code relief plan can be implemented.
