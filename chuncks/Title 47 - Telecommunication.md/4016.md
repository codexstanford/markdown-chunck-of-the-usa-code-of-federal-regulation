####### One grant per geographic area.

(e)The FCC may grant one and only one application for a paging geographic area authorization for any specific channel or channel pair in any specific paging geographic area defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Selection from among mutually exclusive applications for a paging geographic area authorization will be made in accordance with the procedures in §§ 22.131 and 22.200 through 22.299. If after the selection process but prior to filing a "long form" application, a successful bidder decides to partition the paging geographic area, the FCC may require and accept multiple "long form" applications from the consortium members.
