Interference from each base station to each microwave should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations having more or less (within +/-50 percent) the same height above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path to a microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving site of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total power of the group and the average antenna height of the group to calculate path loss, L.
