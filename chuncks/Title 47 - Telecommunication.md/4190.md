####### Interference analysis.

(b)Cellular Radiotelephone licensees-who receive an initial notification described in ยง 90.674(a) of this chapter-shall perform a timely analysis of the interference to identify the possible source. Immediate on-site visits may be conducted when necessary to complete timely analysis. Interference analysis must be completed and corrective action initiated within 48 hours of the initial complaint from a part 90 of this chapter public safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 96 hours after the initial complaint from other part 90 of this chapter non-cellular licensees provided affected communications on these systems are not safety related. Corrective action may be delayed if the affected licensee agrees in writing (which may be, but is not required to be, recorded via e-mail or other electronic means) to a longer period.
