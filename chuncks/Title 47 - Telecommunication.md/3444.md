## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 15 - RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES
##### Subpart H - White Space Devices
###### ยง 15.717 White space devices that rely on spectrum sensing.
####### Power limit for devices that rely on sensing.

(b)The white space device shall meet the requirements for personal/portable devices in this subpart except that it will be limited to a maximum EIRP of 50 mW per 6 megahertz of bandwidth on which the device operates and it does not have to comply with the requirements for geo-location and database access in ยง 15.711(b), (d), and (e). Compliance with the detection threshold for spectrum sensing in ยง 15.717(c), although required, is not necessarily sufficient for demonstrating reliable interference avoidance. Once a device is certified, additional devices that are identical in electrical characteristics and antenna systems may be certified under the procedures of part 2, Subpart J of this chapter.
