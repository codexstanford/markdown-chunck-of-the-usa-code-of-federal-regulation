######## Report and Order on Further Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,

(2) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the AWS licensee will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub using the method prescribed in "Methods for Predicting Interference from Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for Supplying Data on Response Station Systems. MM Docket 97-217," in Amendment of Parts 1, 21 and 74 to Enable Multipoint Distribution Service and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licensees to Engage in Fixed Two-Way Transmissions, MM Docket No. 97-217,15 FCC Rcd 14566 at 14610, Appendix D.

(b) Any AWS licensee in the 2110-2180 MHz band that causes actual and demonstrable interference to a BRS licensee in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band must take steps to eliminate the harmful interference, up to and including relocation of the BRS licensee, regardless of whether it would be required to do so under paragraph (a), of this section.
