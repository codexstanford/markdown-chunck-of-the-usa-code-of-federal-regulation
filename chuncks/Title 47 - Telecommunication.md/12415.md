######## Reciprocal contour analysis.

(2)In addition to the contour analysis described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any applicant seeking to license a fixed station on a channel in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz band segment must also pass a reciprocal contour analysis. Under the reciprocal analysis, the interference contour, F(50,10) of an incumbent operating a fixed station on an upper- or lower-adjacent channel must create no contour overlap with the proposed 40 dBu F(50,50) contour of the applicant's fixed station. The incumbent's interference contour is determined using the dBu level listed in the appropriate table in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For this analysis the applicant shall plot the coverage contour of its fixed station, F(50,50), at its proposed ERP and antenna height above average terrain but plot the interference contour, F(50,10), of any adjacent-channel incumbent licensee at its maximum permitted ERP for the licensed antenna height.
