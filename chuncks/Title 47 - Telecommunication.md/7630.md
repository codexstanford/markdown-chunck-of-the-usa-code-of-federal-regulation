####### Notification of substantive change.

(f)(1) States must notify the Commission of substantive changes in their TRS programs within 60 days of when they occur, and must certify that the state TRS program continues to meet federal minimum standards after implementing the substantive change.

(2) VRS and IP Relay providers certified under this section must notify the Commission of substantive changes in their TRS programs, services, and features within 60 days of when such changes occur, and must certify that the interstate TRS provider continues to meet Federal minimum standards after implementing the substantive change. Substantive changes shall include, but not be limited to:

(i) The use of new equipment or technologies to facilitate the manner in which relay services are provided;

(ii) Providing services from a new facility not previously identified to the Commission or the Fund administrator; and

(iii) Discontinuation of service from any facility.

(g) Internet-based TRS providers certified under this section shall file with the Commission, on an annual basis, a report demonstrating that they are in compliance with § 64.604.

(1) Such reports must update the information required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and include updated documentation and a summary of the updates, or certify that there are no changes to the information and documentation submitted with the application for certification, application for renewal of certification, or the most recent annual report, as applicable.

(2) The chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), or other senior executive of an Internet-based TRS provider under this section with first hand knowledge of the accuracy and completeness of the information provided, when submitting an annual report under paragraph (g) of this section, must, with each such submission, certify as follows:

(3) Each VRS provider shall include within its annual report a compliance plan describing the provider's policies, procedures, and practices for complying with the requirements of § 64.604(c)(13) of this subpart. Such compliance plan shall include, at a minimum:

(i) Identification of any officer(s) or managerial employee(s) responsible for ensuring compliance with § 64.604(c)(13) of this subpart;

(ii) A description of any compliance training provided to the provider's officers, employees, and contractors;

(iii) Identification of any telephone numbers, Web site addresses, or other mechanisms available to employees for reporting abuses;

(iv) A description of any internal audit processes used to ensure the accuracy and completeness of minutes submitted to the TRS Fund administrator; and

(v) A description of all policies and practices that the provider is following to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of the TRS Fund. A provider that fails to file a compliance plan shall not be entitled to compensation for the provision of VRS during the period of noncompliance.

(4) If, at any time, the Commission determines that a VRS provider's compliance plan currently on file is inadequate to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of the TRS Fund, the Commission shall so notify the provider, shall explain the reasons the plan is inadequate, and shall direct the provider to correct the identified defects and submit an amended compliance plan reflecting such correction within a specified time period not to exceed 60 days. A provider that fails to comply with such directive shall not be entitled to compensation for the provision of VRS during the period of noncompliance. A submitted compliance plan shall not be prima facie evidence of the plan's adequacy; nor shall it be evidence that the provider has fulfilled its obligations under § 64.604(c)(13) of this subpart.

(5) If a VRS provider is authorized to provide at-home call handling, its annual compliance report shall include the following information:

(i) The total number of CAs handling VRS calls from home workstations over the preceding year;

(ii) The number of 911 calls handled by the provider's home workstations;

(iii) The total number of complaints, if any, submitted to the provider regarding its at-home call handling program or calls handled by at-home CAs; and

(iv) A description of any substantive changes in the VRS provider's currently effective at-home call-handling compliance plan.
