####### Reasonably comparable rates.

(g)A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier that receives monthly support pursuant to ยง 54.307(e)(5), (e)(6), or (e)(7) shall offer its services in the areas for which it receives such monthly support at rates that are reasonably comparable to those rates offered in urban areas and must advertise the voice and broadband services it offers in its subsidized service areas. A mobile competitive eligible telecommunications carrier's rates shall be considered reasonably comparable to urban rates, based upon the most recently-available decennial U.S. Census Bureau data identifying areas as urban, if rates for services in rural areas fall within a reasonable range of urban rates for reasonably comparable voice and broadband services.

(1) If the carrier offers service in urban areas, it may demonstrate that it offers reasonably comparable rates if it offers the same rates, terms, and conditions (including usage allowances, if any, for a specific rate) in both urban and rural areas or if one of the carrier's stand-alone voice service plans and one service plan offering data are substantially similar to plans it offers in urban areas.

(2) If the carrier does not offer service in urban areas, it may demonstrate that it offers reasonably comparable rates by identifying a carrier that does offer service in urban areas and the specific rate plans to which its plans are reasonably comparable, along with submission of corroborating evidence that its rates are reasonably comparable, such as marketing materials from the identified carrier.
