####### Emission limits.

(d)(1) The adjacent channel emission limits shown in the tables in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section apply in the six megahertz channel immediately adjacent to each white space channel or group of contiguous white space channels in which the white space device is operating.

(2) At frequencies beyond the six megahertz channel immediately adjacent to each white space channel or group of contiguous white space channels in which the white space device is operating the white space device shall meet the requirements of ยง 15.209.

(3) Emission measurements in the adjacent bands shall be performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz with an average detector. A narrower resolution bandwidth may be employed near the band edge, when necessary, provided the measured energy is integrated to show the total power over 100 kHz.
