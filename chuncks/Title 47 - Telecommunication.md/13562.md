####### Hub transmitter e.i.r.p. spectral area density limit at elevation angles above the horizon.

(3)LMDS applicants shall demonstrate that, under clear air operating conditions, the maximum aggregate of LMDS transmitting hub stations in a Basic Trading Area in the 29.1-29.25 GHz band will not transmit a co-frequency hub-to-subscriber e.i.r.p. spectral area density in any azimuthal direction in excess of X dBW/(MHz-km) when averaged over any 4.375 MHz band where X is defined in Table 2. Individual hub stations may exceed their clear air e.i.r.p.s by employment of adaptive power control in cases where link propagation attenuation exceeds the clear air value and only to the extent that the link is impaired.

(i) The e.i.r.p. aggregate spectral area density is calculated as follows:

(ii) LMDS system licensees in two or more BTAs may individually or collectively deviate from the spectral area density computed above by averaging the power over any 200 km by 400 km area, provided that the aggregate interference to the satellite receiver is no greater than if the spectral area density were as specified in Table 1. A showing to the Commission comparing both methods of computation is required and copies shall be served on any affected non-GSO MSS providers.
