#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Subpart N - Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability In Programs or Activities Conducted By the Federal Communications Commission
###### ยง 1.1850 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
####### General.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the Commission shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not-

(1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;

(2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity, or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Commission personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with ยง 1.1850(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Managing Director, in consultation with the Section 504 Officer, after considering all Commission resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
