(k) The field strength charts (§ 73.699, Figs. 9-10c) were developed assuming a terrain roughness factor of 50 meters, which is considered to be representative of average terrain in the United States. Where the roughness factor for a particular propagation path is found to depart appreciably from this value, a terrain roughness correction (Δ) should be applied to field strength values along this path as predicted with the use of these charts. The magnitude and sign of this correction, for any value of Δmay be determined from a chart included in § 73.699 as Figure 10e, with linear interpolation as necessary, for the frequency of the UHF signal under consideration.

(l) Alternatively, the terrain roughness correction may be computed using the following formula:
