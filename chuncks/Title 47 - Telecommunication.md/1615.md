(4)A licensee that holds a license pursuant to small business, rural service provider, and/or entrepreneur provisions (§ 1.2110 and § 24.709 of this chapter) and continues to be subject to unjust enrichment requirements (§ 1.2111 and § 24.714 of this chapter) and/or transfer restrictions (§ 24.839 of this chapter) may enter into a spectrum manager leasing arrangement with a spectrum lessee, regardless of whether the spectrum lessee meets the Commission's designated entity eligibility requirements (§ 1.2110 of this chapter) or its entrepreneur eligibility requirements to hold certain C and F block licenses in the broadband personal communications services (§ 1.2110 and § 24.709 of this chapter), so long as the spectrum manager leasing arrangement does not result in the spectrum lessee's becoming a "controlling interest" or "affiliate" (§ 1.2110 of this chapter) of the licensee such that the licensee would lose its eligibility as a designated entity or entrepreneur.
