######## Delegations of authority to the staff.

(c)Pursuant to section 5(c) of the Communications Act, the Commission has delegated authority to its staff to act on matters which are minor or routine or settled in nature and those in which immediate action may be necessary. See subpart B of this part. Actions taken under delegated authority are subject to review by the Commission, on its own motion or on an application for review filed by a person aggrieved by the action. Except for the possibility of review, actions taken under delegated authority have the same force and effect as actions taken by the Commission. The delegation of authority to a staff officer, however, does not mean that the staff officer will exercise that authority in all matters subject to the delegation. The staff is at liberty to refer any matter at any stage to the Commission for action, upon concluding that it involves matters warranting the Commission's consideration, and the Commission may instruct the staff to do so.
