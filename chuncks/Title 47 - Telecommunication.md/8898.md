(d)(1) The reference coordinates of a DTV allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments are the coordinates of the authorized transmitting antenna site of the associated analog TV station, as set forth in Appendix B of the(referenced above). An application for authority to construct or modify DTV facilities on such an allotment may specify an alternate location for the DTV transmitting antenna that is within 5 kilometers of the DTV allotment reference coordinates without consideration of electromagnetic interference to other DTV or analog TV broadcast stations, allotments or applications, provided the application complies with paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Location of the transmitting antenna of such a station at a site more than 5 kilometers from the DTV allotment reference coordinates must comply with the provisions of section 73.623(c). In the case where a DTV station has been granted authority to construct more than 5 kilometers from its reference coordinates pursuant to section 73.623(c), and its authorized coverage area extends in any azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage area determined for the DTV allotment reference facilities, then the coordinates of such authorized site are to be used in addition to the coordinates of the DTV allotment to determine protection from new DTV allotments pursuant to ยง 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV applications filed pursuant to ยง 73.623(c).

(2) The reference coordinates of a DTV allotment not included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments shall be the authorized transmitter site, or, where such a transmitter site is not available for use as a reference point, the coordinates as designated in the FCC order modifying the DTV Table of Allotments.
