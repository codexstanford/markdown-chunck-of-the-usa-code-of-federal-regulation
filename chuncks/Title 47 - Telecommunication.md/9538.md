####### Applications for additional time to complete construction,Delegation of authority.

(5)-(i)Authority is delegated to the Chief, Media Bureau to grant a single extension of time of up to six months to licensees of reassigned stations, UHF-to-VHF stations, and High-VHF-to-Low-VHF stations to complete construction of their post-auction channel upon demonstration by the licensee that failure to meet the construction deadline is due to circumstances that are either unforeseeable or beyond the licensee's control. Licensees needing additional time beyond such a single extension of time to complete construction shall be subject to the tolling provisions in ยง 73.3598.

(ii) Circumstances that may justify an extension of the construction deadline of a licensee of a reassigned station, a UHF-to-VHF station, or a High-VHF-to-Low-VHF station include but are not limited to:

(A) Weather-related delays, including a tower location in a weather-sensitive area;

(B) Delays in construction due to the unavailability of equipment or a tower crew;

(C) Tower lease disputes;

(D) Unusual technical challenges, such as the need to construct a top-mounted or side-mounted antenna or the need to coordinate channel changes with another station; and

(E) Delays faced by licensees that must obtain government approvals, such as land use or zoning approvals, or that are subject to competitive bidding requirements prior to purchasing equipment or services.

(iii) A licensee of a reassigned station, UHF-to-VHF station, or High-VHF-to-Low-VHF station may rely on "financial hardship" as a criterion for seeking an extension of time if it is subject to an active bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, provided that the licensee makes an adequate showing that it has filed requests to proceed with construction in the relevant court proceedings. Any other licensee that seeks an extension of time based on financial hardship must demonstrate that, although it is not subject to an active bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, rare and exceptional financial circumstances warrant granting additional time to complete construction.

(iv) Applications for additional time to complete construction must be filed electronically in CDBS using FCC Form 337 no less than 90 days before the expiration of the construction permit.
