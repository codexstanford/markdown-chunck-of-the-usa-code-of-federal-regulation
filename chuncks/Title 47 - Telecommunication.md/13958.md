a. E.O. No. 12472 established national policy guidance in support of National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) objectives. Executive Order No. 12472 mandates that action be taken to ". . . ensure that a national telecommunications infrastructure is developed . . .". Consistent with the Executive Order, functionally similar government telecommunications networks should be designed to interchange traffic in support of national leadership requirements.

b. The SHARES HF Radio Program will provide a backup capability to exchange critical information among Federal entities to support NSEP. Federally controlled HF radio resources will be shared to establish a robust NSEP HF radio communications infrastructure. The program involves a collection of existing Federally controlled HF radio stations that inter-operate to transmit NSEP messages when normal means of communication are not available.
