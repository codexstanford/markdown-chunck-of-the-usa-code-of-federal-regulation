####### Commercials locally inserted by a station's agent-safe harbor.

(5)With respect to commercials locally inserted, which for the purposes of this provision are commercial advertisements added to a programming stream for the television broadcast station by a third party after it has been received from the programmer but prior to or at the time of transmission to viewers, a station may demonstrate compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP by relying on the third party local inserter's certification of compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP, provided that:

(i) The television broadcast station has no reason to believe that the certification is false;

(ii) The television broadcast station certifies that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints; and

(iii) The television broadcast station performs a spot check, as defined in ยง 73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on the programming at issue in response to an enforcement inquiry concerning a pattern or trend of complaints regarding commercials inserted by that third party.

(6) Instead of demonstrating compliance pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section, a station may demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section in response to an enforcement inquiry prompted by a pattern or trend of complaints by demonstrating actual compliance with ATSC A/85 RP with regard to the commercial advertisements that are the subject of the inquiry, and certifying that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any such pattern or trend of complaints.
