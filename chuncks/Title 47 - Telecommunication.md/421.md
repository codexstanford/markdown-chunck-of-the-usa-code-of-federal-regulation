###### Appeal and Reconsideration of Presiding Officer's Ruling
####### ยง 1.301 Appeal from interlocutory rulings by a presiding officer, other than the Commission, or a case manager; effective date of ruling.
######## Interlocutory rulings which are appealable as a matter of right.

(a)Rulings listed in this paragraph are appealable as a matter of right. An appeal from such a ruling may not be deferred and raised as an exception to the initial decision.

(1) If a ruling denies or terminates the right of any person to participate as a party to a hearing proceeding, such person, as a matter of right, may file an appeal from that ruling.

(2) If a ruling requires testimony or the production of documents, over objection based on a claim of privilege, the ruling on the claim of privilege is appealable as a matter of right.

(3) If a ruling denies a motion to disqualify the presiding officer or case manager, the ruling is appealable as a matter of right.

(4) A ruling removing counsel from the hearing is appealable as a matter of right, by counsel on his own behalf or by his client. (In the event of such ruling, the presiding officer will adjourn the hearing proceeding for such period as is reasonably necessary for the client to secure new counsel and for counsel to become familiar with the case).
