####### i.e.

(i) When a decoder supporting the Alternative Minimum Color List in Table 7 receives an RGB value not in the list (, an RGB value whose non-zero elements are not the same value), it will map the received value to one of the values in the list via the following algorithm:

(A) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and different-e.g., (1,2,3), (3,2,1), and (2,1,3), the 1 value will be changed to 0, the 2 value will remain unchanged, and the 3 value will be changed to 2.

(B) For RGB values with all elements non-zero and with two common elements-e.g., (3,1,3), (2,1,2), and (2,2,3), if the common elements are 3 and the uncommon one is 1, then the 1 elements is changed to 0; e.g. (3,1,3) &#x2192; (3,0,3). If the common elements are 1 and the uncommon element is 3, then the 1 elements are changed to 0, and the 3 element is changed to 2; e.g. (1,3,1) &#x2192; (0,2,0). In all other cases, the uncommon element is changed to the common value; e.g., (2,2,3) &#x2192; (2,2,2), (1,2,1) &#x2192; (1,1,1), and (3,2,3) &#x2192; (3,3,3).

(ii) All decoders not supporting either one of the two color lists described above, must support the full 64 possible RGB color value combinations.
