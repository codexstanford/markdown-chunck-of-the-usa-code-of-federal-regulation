######## Eligibility for Installment Payments.

(b)PCS licensees that are allowed to pay for their licenses in installments under our designated entity rules will have identical payment options available to them with respect to payments under the cost-sharing plan. The specific terms of the installment payment mechanism, including the treatment of principal and interest, are the same as those applicable to the licensee's installment auction payments. If, for any reason, the entity eligible for installment payments is no longer eligible for such installment payments on its license, that entity is no longer eligible for installment payments under the cost-sharing plan. UTAM may make quarterly payments over a five-year period with an interest rate of prime plus 2.5 percent. UTAM may also negotiate separate repayment arrangements with other parties.
