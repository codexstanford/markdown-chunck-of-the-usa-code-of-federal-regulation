####### Notification.

(d)A health care facility shall notify the MBAN frequency coordinator whenever an MBAN programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2390 MHz band is permanently taken out of service, unless it is replaced with transmitter(s) using the same technical characteristics as those reported on the health care facility's registration, which will cover the replacement transmitter(s). A health care facility shall keep the information contained in each registration current and shall notify the MBAN frequency coordinator of any material change to the MBAN's location or operating parameters. In the event that the health care facility proposes to change the MBAN's location or operating parameters, the MBAN coordinator must first evaluate the proposed changes and comply with paragraph (e) of this section as appropriate before the health care facility may operate the MBAN in the 2360-2390 MHz band under changed operating parameters.
