(1) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 10 kHz, but no more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 116 log (f/6.1) dB, or 50 + 10 log (P) dB, or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation;

(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
