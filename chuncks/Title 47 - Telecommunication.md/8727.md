###### § 73.184 Groundwave field strength graphs.
####### p,b

First solve for &#x3C7; by substituting the known values of, (R/λ), and cosin equation (1). Equation (2) may then be solved for δ and equation (3) for ε. At distances greater than 80/fMHz kilometers the curves of Graph 21 do not give the correct relative values of field strength since the curvature of the earth weakens the field more rapidly than these plane earth curves would indicate. Thus, no attempt should be made to fit experimental data to these curves at the larger distances.
