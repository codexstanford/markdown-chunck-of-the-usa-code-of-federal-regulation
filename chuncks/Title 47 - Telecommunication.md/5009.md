######## i.e.,

(a)(1) If Lower H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction for this spectrum cover, collectively, at least forty (40) percent of the nation's population, the amount owed to UTAM, Inc. by each individual Lower H Block licensee (reimbursement amount owed or RN) will be determined by dividing the gross winning bid (GWB) for each individual Lower H Block license (an Economic Area (EA)) by the sum of the gross winning bids for all Lower H Block licenses for which there is a winning bid in the first auction, and then multiplying by $12,629,857.

(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a licensee that obtains a license for a market in which no license is granted as a result of the first Lower H Block auction will not have a reimbursement obligation to UTAM, Inc.

(b) If Lower H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction for this spectrum cover, collectively, less than forty (40) percent of the nation's population, then the pro rata amount that the licensee of an individual Lower H Block license must reimburse UTAM, Inc. shall be calculated by dividing the population of the individual EA by the total U.S. population, and then multiplying by $12,629,857. In this event, the same population data, e.g., 2010, used to calculate the RNs for Lower H Block licenses granted as a result of the first auction will apply to subsequent auctions of Lower H Block licenses that were not granted as a result of an earlier auction of Lower H Block licenses.

(c) A winning bidder of a Lower H Block license that is not granted a license for any reason will be deemed to have triggered a reimbursement obligation to UTAM, Inc. This obligation will be owed to UTAM, Inc. by the licensee acquiring the Lower H Block license through a subsequent auction. The amount owed by the licensee acquiring the Lower H Block license at such auction will be the RN calculated for the EA license based on the first auction (calculated under paragraphs (a) or (b), as applicable, of this section).

(d) For purposes of compliance with this section, licensees should determine population based on 2010 U.S. Census Data or such other data or measurements that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau proposes and adopts under the notice and comment process for the auction procedures.
