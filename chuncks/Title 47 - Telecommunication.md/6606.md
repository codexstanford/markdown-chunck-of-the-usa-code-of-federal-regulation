(c)-(1)The billed entity for a school that receives discounts for Internet access or internal connections must certify on FCC Form 486 that an Internet safety policy is being enforced. If the school is an eligible member of a consortium but is not the billed entity for the consortium, the school must certify instead on FCC Form 479 ("Certification to Consortium Leader of Compliance with the Children's Internet Protection Act") that an Internet safety policy is being enforced.

The school must enforce the operation of the technology protection measure during use of its computers with Internet access, although an administrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifying authority under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may disable the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose. This Internet safety policy must also include monitoring the online activities of minors. Beginning July 1, 2012, schools' Internet safety policies must provide for educating minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking Web sites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response.

(ii) The Internet safety policy adopted and enforced pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 254(l) must address all of the following issues:
