###### ยง 78.36 Frequency coordination.
####### General requirements.

(1)Applicants are responsible for selecting the frequency assignments that are least likely to result in mutual interference with other licensees in the same area. Applicants may consult local frequency coordination committees, where they exist, for information on frequencies available in the area. Proposed frequency usage must be coordinated with existing licensees and applicants in the area whose facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference on active channels, applied-for channels, or channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must be completed prior to filing an application for regular authorization, for major amendment to a pending application, or for major modification to a license.

(2) To be acceptable for filing, all applications for regular authorization, or major amendment to a pending application, or major modification to a license, must include a certification attesting that all co-channel and adjacent-channel licensees and applicants potentially affected by the proposed fixed use of the frequency(ies) have been notified and are in agreement that the proposed facilities can be installed without causing harmful interference to those other licensees and applicants.

(d) For each frequency coordinated under this part, applicants are responsible for selecting the frequency assignments that are least likely to result in mutual interference with other licensees in the same area. Applicants may consult local frequency coordination committees, where they exist, for information on frequencies available in the area. In selecting frequencies, consideration should be given to the relative location of receive points, normal transmission paths, and the nature of the contemplated operation.
