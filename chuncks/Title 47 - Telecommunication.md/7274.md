####### Sequential Introduction of Zones in the Same Tariff Year.

(3)Notwithstanding §§ 61.47(e) through (f), price cap local exchange carriers that have established density pricing zones pursuant to § 69.123 of this chapter, and whose special access zone date and transport zone date occur on different dates during the same tariff year, shall, on the earlier date, establish density pricing zone SBIs and pricing bands using the methodology described in §§ 61.47(e) through (f), but applicable to the earlier service only. On the later date, such carriers shall recalculate the SBIs and pricing bands to limit the pricing flexibility of the services included in each density pricing zone category, as reflected in its SBI, as follows:

(i) The upper pricing band shall be a weighted average of the following:

(A) The upper pricing band that applied to the earlier services included in the zone category on the day preceding the later date, weighted by the revenue weight of the earlier services included in the zone category; and

(B) 1.05 times the SBI value for the services included in the zone category on the day preceding the later date, weighted by the revenue weight of the later services included in the zone category.

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) On the later date, the SBI value for the zone category shall be equal to the SBI value for the category on the day preceding the later date.
