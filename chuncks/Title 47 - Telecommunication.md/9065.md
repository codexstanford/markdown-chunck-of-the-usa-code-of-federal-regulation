If the operation at variance will exceed 10 consecutive days, a notification must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C., not later than the 10th day of such operation. In the event normal operation is resumed prior to the end of the 30 day period, the licensee must notify the FCC upon restoration of normal operation. If causes beyond the control of the licensee prevent restoration of normal operation within 30 days, a written request must be made to the FCC in Washington, D.C., no later than the 30th day for such additional time as may be necessary.
