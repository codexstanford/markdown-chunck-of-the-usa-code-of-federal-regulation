######## Forward contour analysis.

(1)An applicant seeking to license a fixed station on a channel in the 809-817 MHz/854-862 MHz band segment will only be granted if the applicant's proposed interference contour creates no overlap with the 40 dBu F(50,50) contour of an incumbent operating a fixed station on an upper- or lower-adjacent channel. The applicant's interference contour is determined using the dBu level listed in the appropriate table in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For this analysis the applicant shall plot the interference contour of its proposed fixed station at its proposed ERP but assume that any adjacent-channel incumbent licensee is operating at the maximum permitted ERP for the licensed antenna height.
