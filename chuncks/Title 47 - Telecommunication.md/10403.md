####### Cost identification at the franchise level.

(g)After costs have been directly assigned to and allocated among the service cost categories and the equipment basket, cable operators that have aggregated costs at a higher level than the franchise level must identify all applicable costs at the franchise level in the following manner:

(1) Recoverable costs that have been identified at the highest organizational level at which costs have been identified shall be allocated to the next (lower) organizational level at which recoverable costs have been identified on the basis of the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the lower level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level.

(2) Cable operators shall repeat the procedure specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section at every organizational level at which recoverable costs have been identified until such costs have been allocated to the franchise level.
