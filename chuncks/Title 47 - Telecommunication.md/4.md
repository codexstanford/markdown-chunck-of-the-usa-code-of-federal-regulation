######## Commission action.

(d)Matters requiring Commission action, or warranting its consideration, are dealt with by the Commission at regular monthly meetings, or at special meetings called to consider a particular matter. Meetings are normally held at the principal offices of the Commission in the District of Columbia, but may be held elsewhere in the United States. In appropriate circumstances, Commission action may be taken between meetings "by circulation", which involves the submission of a document to each of the Commissioners for his approval.
