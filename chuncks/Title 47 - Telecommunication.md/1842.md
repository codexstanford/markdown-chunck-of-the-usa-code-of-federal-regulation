(d)(1) The executive branch shall file its notifications as to the status of its review in the public record established in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets for the application, petition, or other filing. Status notifications include notifications of the date on which the Committee sends the tailored questions to an applicant, petitioner, or other filer and the date on which the Chair accepts an applicant's, petitioner's, or other filer's responses to the tailored questions as complete. Status notifications also include extensions of the 120-day review period and 90-day extension period (to include the start and end day of the extension) and updates every thirty (30) days during the 90-day extension period. If the executive branch recommends dismissal of the application, petition, or other filing without prejudice because the applicant, petitioner, or other filer has failed to respond to requests for information, the executive branch shall file that recommendation in the public record established in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets.

(2) In circumstances where the notification of the executive branch contains non-public information, the executive branch shall file a public version of the notification in the public record established in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets for the application, petition, or other filing and shall file the non-public information with the Commission pursuant to ยง 0.457 of this chapter.
