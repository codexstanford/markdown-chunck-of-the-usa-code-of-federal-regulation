######## Purpose of prior coordination.

(b)The coordination of cell sites is for informational purposes only: public safety/CII licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed cell or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:

(1) Allow a public safety/CII licensee to advise the ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensee whether it believes a proposed cell will generate unacceptable interference;

(2) Permit ESMR or part 22 Cellular Radiotelephone licensees to make voluntary changes in cell parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and

(3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the cell is activated.
