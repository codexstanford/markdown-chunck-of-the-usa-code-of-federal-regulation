###### ยง 73.614 Power and antenna height requirements.
####### Maximum power.

(b)Applications will not be accepted for filing if they specify a power which exceeds the maximum permitted boundaries specified in the following formulas:

(1) Channels 2-6 in Zone I:

(2) Channels 2-6 in Zones II and III:

(3) Channels 7-13 in Zone I:

(4) Channels 7-13 in Zones II and III:

(5) Channels 14-36 in Zones I, II, and III

The boundaries specified are to be used to determine the maximum possible combination of antenna height and ERP. When specifying an ERPless than that permitted by the lower boundary, any antenna HAAT can be used. Also, for values of antenna HAAT greater than 2,300 meters the maximum ERP is the lower limit specified for each equation.

(6) The effective radiated power in any horizontal or vertical direction may not exceed the maximum values permitted by this section.

(7) The effective radiated power at any angle above the horizontal shall be as low as the state of the art permits, and in the same vertical plane may not exceed the effective radiated power in either the horizontal direction or below the horizontal, whichever is greater.
