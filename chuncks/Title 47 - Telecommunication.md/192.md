####### § 0.470 Assessment of fees.
######## Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters and requesters who are representatives of the news media.

(2)(i) The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in these categories for the cost of duplication only, pursuant to § 0.465 above, excluding duplication charges for the first 100 pages, provided however, that requesters who are representatives of the news media shall be entitled to a reduced assessment of charges only when the request is for the purpose of distributing information.

(ii) Educational requesters or requesters who are representatives of the news media shall not be assessed fees for the cost of duplication if the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under § 0.461(g), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

(iii) Educational requesters or requesters who are representatives of the news media may still be assessed duplication fees when the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under § 0.461(g) if the Commission determines that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, so long as the Commission has provided a timely written notice to the requester and has discussed with the requester (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request. Additionally, if a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with a time limit under § 0.461(g) will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
