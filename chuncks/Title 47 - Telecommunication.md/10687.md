####### Pay television transmission

(o)shall mean a transmission of a service or schedule of programs, as to which each individual program is generally uninterrupted by commercial advertising messages and for which service or schedule of programs subscribing viewers are charged a periodic subscription fee, such as on a monthly basis, for the reception of such programming delivered by such service whether separately or together with other services or programming, during the specified viewing period covered by such fee. If a given delivery qualifies both as a pay television transmission and pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or subscription-on-demand then, for purposes of this subpart, such delivery shall be deemed pay-per-view, video-on-demand or subscription-on-demand rather than a pay television transmission.
