####### Emission Mask J.

(j)For transmitters that are not equipped with an audio low-pass filter, the power of any emission must be attenuated below the unmodulated carrier power of the transmitter (P) as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 2.5 kHz, but no more than 6.25 kHz: At least 53 log (f/2.5) dB;

(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 6.25 kHz, but no more than 9.5 kHz: At least 103 log (f/3.9) dB;

(3) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 9.5 kHz: At least 157 log (f/5.3) dB, or 50 + 10 log (P) dB or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
