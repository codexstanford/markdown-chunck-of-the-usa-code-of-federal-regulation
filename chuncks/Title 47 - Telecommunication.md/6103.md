(C) The power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such other person, whether through the ownership of or right to vote voting rights attributable to the stock, partnership (general or limited) interest, joint venture participation, or member interest) of such other person, by contract (including but not limited to stockholder agreement, partnership (general or limited) agreement, joint venture agreement, or operating agreement), or otherwise;

(ii) The NANPA and B&C Agent, and any affiliate thereof, may not issue a majority of its debt to, nor may it derive a majority of its revenues from, any telecommunications service provider.

(iii) Notwithstanding the neutrality criteria set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the NANPA and B&C Agent may be determined to be or not to be subject to undue influence by parties with a vested interest in the outcome of numbering administration and activities.
