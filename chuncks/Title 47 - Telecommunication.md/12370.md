####### Non-swept power measurement.

(2)Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the mesurement bandwidth and frequency offset from the assigned center frequency as shown in the tables in ยง 90.543 (a) above. Any value of resolution bandwidth may be used as long as it does not exceed 2 percent of the specified measurement bandwidth. Measure the power level in dBm. These measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate ACP by substracting the reference power level measured in (b)(1) from the measurements made in this step. The absolute value of the calculated ACP must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the ACP given in the table for each condition above.
