######## Documentation of expenses.,i.e.

(b)Once relocation occurs, the AWS relocator must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items specifically listed in ยง 27.1180(b), as well as any reimbursable items not specifically listed in ยง 27.1180(b) that are directly attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS relocator must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform cost data requested by the clearinghouse along with copies, without redaction, of the relocation agreement, if any, and the third party appraisal described in (a)(3), of this section, if prepared. The AWS relocator must identify the particular system associated with appropriate expenses (, costs may not be averaged over numerous systems). If an AWS relocator pays a BRS incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities in whole or in part, the AWS relocator must itemize the actual costs to the extent determinable, and otherwise must estimate the actual costs associated with relocating the incumbent and itemize these costs. If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible for reimbursement. All AWS relocators seeking reimbursement through the clearinghouse have an ongoing duty to maintain all relevant records of BRS relocation-related expenses until the sunset of cost-sharing obligations, and to provide, upon request, such documentation, including a copy of the independent appraisal if one was conducted, to the clearinghouse, the Commission, or AWS entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation.
