#### ยง 211.5 Priorities.

There are hereby established four levels of restoration priority. Within each level, subpriorities may be established by the Executive Agent, with the concurrence of the National Security Council, for both government and nongovernment services. The subpriorities categories currently in use, which have been established by the Executive Agent will remain in effect until modified. Compatibility of subcategories applicable to government and nongovernment users is essential to achieve the objective of a single restoration priority system.
