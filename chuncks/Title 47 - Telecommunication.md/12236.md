###### ยง 90.309 Tables and figures.
####### Directions for Using the Figures.

(b)(1) Determine antenna height above average terrain. (According to ยง 90.309(a)(4).)

(2) Locate this value on the antenna height axis.

(3) Determine the separation between the LM antenna site and the nearest protected co-channel TV station. (According to ยง 73.611.)

(4) Draw a vertical line to intersect the LM/TV separation curve at the distance determined in step 3 above. For distances not shown in the graph use linear interpolation.

(5) From the intersection of the LM/TV separation curve draw a horizontal line to the power reduction scale.

(6) The power reduction in dB determines the reduction below 1 kW that must be achieved.

(7) See table F for dB/power equivalents.
