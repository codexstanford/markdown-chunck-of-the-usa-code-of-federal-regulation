###### ยง 73.1690 Modification of transmission systems.
####### i.e.,

(2) Replacement of a directional FM antenna, where the measured or computer modeled composite directional antenna pattern does not exceed the licensed composite directional pattern at any azimuth, where no change in effective radiated power will result, and where compliance with the principal coverage requirements of ยง 73.315(a) will be maintained by the measured or computer modeled directional pattern. The antenna must be mounted not more than 2 meters above or 4 meters below the authorized values. The modification of license application on FCC Form 2100, Schedule 302-FM to cover the antenna replacement must contain all of the data in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. Program test operations at one half (50%) power may commence immediately upon installation pursuant to ยง 73.1620(a)(3). However, if the replacement directional antenna is an exact replacement (no change in manufacturer, antenna model number, AND measured or computer modeled composite antenna pattern), program test operations may commence immediately upon installation at the full authorized power.

(i) A measured or computer modeled directional antenna pattern and tabulation on the antenna manufacturer's letterhead showing both the horizontally and vertically polarized radiation components and demonstrating that neither of the components exceeds the authorized composite antenna pattern along any azimuth.
