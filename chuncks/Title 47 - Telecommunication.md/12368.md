####### ACP measurement procedure.

(b)The following are the procedures for making the transmitter ACP measurements. For all measurements modulate the transmitter as it would be modulated in normal operating conditions. For time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is active. All measurements are made at the transmitter's output port. If a transmitter has an integral antenna, a suitable power coupling device shall be used to couple the RF signal to the measurement instrument. The coupling device shall substantially maintain the proper transmitter load impedance. The ACP measurements may be made with a spectrum analyzer capable of making direct ACP measurements. "Measurement bandwidth", as used for non-swept measurements, implies an instrument that measures the power in many narrow bandwidths equal to the nominal resolution bandwidth and integrates these powers to determine the total power in the specified measurement bandwidth.
