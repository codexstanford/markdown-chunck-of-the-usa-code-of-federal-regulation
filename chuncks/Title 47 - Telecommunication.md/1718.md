######## Overview.

(a)A "private commons" arrangement is an arrangement, distinct from a spectrum leasing arrangement but permitted in the same services for which spectrum leasing arrangements are allowed, in which a licensee or spectrum lessee makes certain spectrum usage rights under a particular license authorization available to a class of third-party users employing advanced communications technologies that involve peer-to-peer (device-to-device) communications and that do not involve use of the licensee's or spectrum lessee's end-to-end physical network infrastructure (e.g., base stations, mobile stations, or other related elements). In a private commons arrangement, the licensee or spectrum lessee authorizes users of certain communications devices employing particular technical parameters, as specified by the licensee or spectrum lessee, to operate under the license authorization. A private commons arrangement differs from a spectrum leasing arrangement in that, unlike spectrum leasing arrangements, a private commons arrangement does not involve individually negotiated spectrum access rights with entities that seek to provide network-based services to end-users. A private commons arrangement does not affect unlicensed operations in a particular licensed band to the extent that they are permitted pursuant to part 15.
