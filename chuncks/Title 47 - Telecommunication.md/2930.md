####### Message Validity.,i.e.,

(10)An EAS Decoder must provide error detection and validation of the header codes of each message to ascertain if the message is valid. Header code comparisons may be accomplished through the use of a bit-by-bit compare or any other error detection and validation protocol. A header code must only be considered valid when two of the three headers match exactly; the Origination Date/Time field (JJJHHMM) is not more than 15 minutes in the future and the expiration time (Origination Date/Time plus Valid Time TTTT) is in the future (current time at the EAS equipment when the alert is received is between origination time minus 15 minutes and expiration time). Duplicate messages must not be relayed automatically.

(11) A header code with the EAN Event code specified in ยง 11.31(c) that is received through any of the audio or data inputs must override all other messages.

(b) Decoders shall be capable of operation within the tolerances specified in this section as well as those in ยง 11.32 (b), (c) and (d).
