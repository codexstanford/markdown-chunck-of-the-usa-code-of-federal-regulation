7.The mission of the NCS is to assist the President, the National Security Council (NSC), the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the exercise of the telecommunications functions and responsibilities assigned to them by E.O. 12472, and to coordinate the planning for and provision of NSEP telecommunications for the Federal government under all circumstances, including crisis or emergency, attack, recovery, and reconstitution.

a. To support the performance of this mission, a unified planning process for NSEP telecommunications will be implemented to:

(1) Establish, on an evolutionary basis, a NSEP telecommunications planning mechanism that facilitates the integration of Federal government, commercial/private sector, and State/local government activities and capabilities;

(2) Define the capabilities required to support NSEP telecommunications needs;

(3) Identify a set of feasible near- and long-term national level NSEP telecommunications initiatives for the achievement of those capabilities; and

(4) Develop, and provide for the effective implementation of, approved national level NSEP telecommunications programs.

b. These planning functions will be carried out within the framework of an overall process involving the design and maintenance of an evolutionary NSEP telecommunications architecture, and the annual development, documentation, review, and approval of capability objectives, deficiencies and priorities, candidate initiatives, and a National Level Program.
