####### Determining reimbursable costs.

(a)The Relocation Payment Clearinghouse shall review reimbursement requests to determine whether they are reasonable and to ensure they comply with the requirements adopted in this sub-part.

Reimbursement submissions that fall within the estimated range of costs in the cost category schedule issued by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau shall be presumed reasonable.

The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau shall make further determinations related to reimbursable costs, as necessary, throughout the transition process.
