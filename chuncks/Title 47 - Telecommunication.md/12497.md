####### i.e.,

(f) Licensees authorized Phase I non-nationwide systems, or authorized on Channels 161 through 170 or Channels 181 through 185, must construct their systems (have all specified base stations constructed with all channels) and place their systems in operation, or commence service in accordance with the provisions of ยง 90.167, within twelve months of the initial license grant date. Authorizations for systems not constructed and placed in operation, or having commenced service, within twelve months from the date of initial license grant cancel automatically.

(g) A licensee that loses authorization for some or all of its channels due to failure to meet construction deadlines or benchmarks may not reapply for nationwide channels in the same category or for non-nationwide channels in the same category in the same geographic area for one year from the date the Commission takes final action affirming that those channels have been cancelled.

(h) The requirements and conditions of paragraphs (a) through (e) and paragraph (g) of this section apply to nationwide licensees that construct and operate stations for fixed or paging operations on a primary basis instead of, or in addition to, stations for land mobile operations on a primary basis except that, in satisfying the base station construction and placed in operation requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and the system progress report requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, licensees operating stations for fixed operation on a primary basis instead of, or in addition to, stations for land mobile or paging operations on a primary basis in a given geographic area may demonstrate how such fixed stations are providing substantial service to the public in those geographic areas.
