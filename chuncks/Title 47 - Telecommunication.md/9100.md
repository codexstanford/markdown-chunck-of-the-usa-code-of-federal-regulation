###### ยง 73.753 Antenna systems.

All international broadcasting stations shall operate with directional antennas. Such antennas shall be designed and operated so that the radiated power in the maximum lobe toward the specific zone or area of reception intended to be served shall be at least 10 times the average power from the antenna in the horizontal plane. Radiation in all other directions shall be suppressed to the maximum extent technically feasible. In order to eliminate or mitigate harmful interference, the direction of the maximum lobe may be adjusted upon approval of the Commission.
