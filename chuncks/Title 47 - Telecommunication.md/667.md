(c)The requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible interference to FCC monitoring activities.

(1) Licensees and applicants planning to construct and operate a new or modified station at a permanent fixed location in the vicinity of an FCC protected field office are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to avoid interfering with the monitoring activities of that office. FCC protected field offices are listed in ยง 0.121 of this chapter.

(2) Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that could produce on any channel a direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/mpower flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120ฯ &#x3A9;) in the authorized bandwidth at the protected field office may be examined to determine the potential for interference with monitoring activities. After consideration of the effects of the predicted field strength of the proposed station, including the cumulative effects of the signal from the proposed station with other ambient radio field strength levels at the protected field office, the FCC may add a condition restricting radiation toward the protected field office to the station authorization.

(3) In the event that the calculated field strength exceeds 10 mV/m at the protected field office site, or if there is any question whether field strength levels might exceed that level, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss possible measures to avoid interference to monitoring activities should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate with: Chief, Enforcement Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.

(4) Advance consultation is recommended for applicants that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:

(i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the protected field office;

(ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field offices.

(iii) Stations located within 16 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kw or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field office;

(iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kw or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field office;

(v) Advance coordination for stations transmitting on channels above 1000 MHz is recommended only if the proposed station is in the vicinity of a protected field office designated as a satellite monitoring facility in ยง 0.121 of this chapter.

(vi) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may serve to avoid the need for later modification of the authorizations of stations that interfere with monitoring activities at protected field offices.
