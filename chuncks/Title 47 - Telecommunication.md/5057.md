####### ยง 27.1166 Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.
######## Documentation of expenses.

(b)Once relocation occurs, the AWS relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items specifically listed in ยง 27.1164(b), as well as any reimbursable items not specifically listed in ยง 27.1164(b) that are directly attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform cost data requested by the clearinghouse along with a copy, without redaction, of either the relocation agreement, if any, or the third party appraisal described in (b)(1) of this section, if relocation was undertaken by the microwave incumbent. AWS relocators and voluntarily relocating microwave incumbents must maintain documentation of cost-related issues until the applicable sunset date and provide such documentation upon request, to the clearinghouse, the Commission, or entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation. If an AWS relocator pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities, the AWS relocator must estimate the costs associated with relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated cost for items listed in ยง 27.1164(b). If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible for reimbursement.
