(2)You must answer questions on application forms that call for specific technical data, or that require yes or no answers or other short answers. However, if documents or other lengthy showings are already on file with us and contain the required information, you may incorporate the information by reference, as long as:

(i) The referenced information is filed in ICFS.

(ii) The referenced information is current and accurate in all material respects; and

(iii) The application states where we can find the referenced information as well as:

(A) The application file number, if the reference is to previously-filed applications

(B) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal citation, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.

(d) Step 4: File your application. If you file your application successfully through ICFS, a confirmation screen will appear showing you the date and time of your filing and your submission ID. Print this verification for your records as proof of online filing.
