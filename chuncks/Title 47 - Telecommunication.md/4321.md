###### Appendix I to Subpart E of Part 24 - A Procedure for Calculating PCS Signal Levels at Microwave Receivers (Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order)
####### i.e.,

1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the coordination distance of each base station and the characteristics of each receiver,adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, pattern and height, and line and other losses.

2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.

3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors, and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above, calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.

4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3, determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.

The interference from each base station and the mobiles and portables associated with it is calculated as follows:

Finally, the total PCS interference power at a given microwave receiver from all the base stations in a given frequency band is found by summing the contributions from the individual stations. Likewise, the total interference power at a given microwave receiver from all mobiles and portables operating in a given frequency band is found by summing the contributions from the mobiles and portables associated with each cell.
