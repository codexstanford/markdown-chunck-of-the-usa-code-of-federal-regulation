## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter B - Common Carrier Services
#### PART 64 - MISCELLANEOUS RULES RELATING TO COMMON CARRIERS
##### Appendix A to Part 64 - Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System for National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)
###### i.e.,

(ii) Providing Emergency NSEP services (those assigned provisioning priority level "E") in order of receipt of the service requests;

(iii) Providing Essential NSEP services that have the same provisioning priority level in order of service due dates; and

(iv) Referring any conflicts which cannot be resolved (to the mutual satisfaction of service providers and users) to DHS for resolution.

(b) Comply with NSEP service requests by:

(i) Promptly providing Emergency NSEP services, dispatching outside normal business hours when necessary;

(ii) Promptly meeting requested service dates for Essential NSEP services, negotiating a mutually (authorized user and provider) acceptable service due date when the requested service due date cannot be met; and

(2) Restore NSEP services which suffer outage or are reported as unusable or otherwise in need of restoration, before non-NSEP services, based on restoration priority level assignments. (Note: For broadband or multiple service facilities, restoration is permitted even though it might result in restoration of services assigned to lower priority levels along with, or sometimes ahead of, some higher priority level services.) Restoration will require service providers to restore NSEP services in order of restoration priority level assignment") by:

(a) Promptly restoring NSEP services by dispatching outside normal business hours to restore services assigned Priority Level 1, 2, or 3, when necessary, and services assigned Priority Level 4 or 5 when the next business day is more than 24 hours away;

(b) Restoring NSEP services assigned the same restoration priority level based upon which service can be first restored. (However, restoration actions in progress should not normally be interrupted to restore another NSEP service assigned the same restoration priority level);

(c) Patching and/or rerouting NSEP services assigned restoration priority levels when use of patching and/or rerouting will hasten restoration; and

(d) Referring any conflicts which cannot be resolved (to the mutual satisfaction of service providers and users) to DHS for resolution.

(3) Respond to provisioning requests of authorized users and/or other service providers, and to restoration priority level assignments when an NSEP service suffers an outage or is reported as unusable, by:

(a) Ensuring that provider personnel understand their responsibilities to handle NSEP provisioning requests and to restore NSEP service;

(b) Providing a 24-hour point-of-contact for receiving provisioning requests for Emergency NSEP services and reports of NSEP service outages or unusability; and

(c) Seeking verification from an authorized entity if legitimacy of a priority level assignment or provisioning request for an NSEP service is in doubt. However, processing of Emergency NSEP service requests will not be delayed for verification purposes.

(4) Cooperate with other service providers involved in provisioning or restoring a portion of an NSEP service by honoring provisioning or restoration priority level assignments, or requests for assistance to provision or restore NSEP services.

(5) All service providers, including resale carriers, are required to ensure that service providers supplying underlying facilities are provided information necessary to implement priority treatment of facilities that support NSEP services.

(6) Preempt, when necessary, existing services to provide an NSEP service as authorized in section 6 of this appendix.

(7) Assist in ensuring that priority level assignments of NSEP services are accurately identified "end-to-end" by:

(a) Seeking verification from an authorized Federal government entity if the legitimacy of the restoration priority level assignment is in doubt;

(b) Providing to subcontractors and/or interconnecting carriers the restoration priority level assigned to a service;

(c) Supplying, to DHS, when acting as a prime contractor to a service user, confirmation information regarding NSEP service completion for that portion of the service they have contracted to supply;

(d) Supplying, to DHS, NSEP service information for the purpose of reconciliation;

(e) Cooperating with DHS during reconciliation; and

(f) Periodically initiating reconciliation with their subcontractors and arranging for subsequent subcontractors to cooperate in the reconciliation process.

(8) Receive compensation for costs authorized through tariffs or contracts by:

(a) Provisions contained in properly filed state or Federal tariffs; or

(b) Provisions of properly negotiated contracts where the carrier is not required to file tariffs.
