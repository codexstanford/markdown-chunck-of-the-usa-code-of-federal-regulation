##### Background:

3.In April 1984, Executive Order No. 12472, "Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions," established a framework for the funding of NSEP telecommunications initiatives by the NCS, providing for:

a. The prescription, by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in consultation with the National Security Council (NSC) and the NCS, of general guidelines and procedures for reviewing the financing of the NCS within the budgetary process, and for the preparation of budget estimates by participating agencies.

b. The determination, by the NSC, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and OMB in consultation with the Executive Agent, NCS, and the NCS Committee of Principals (COP), of what constitutes NSEP telecommunications requirements, and

c. The determination, by Federal departments and agencies, of their NSEP telecommunications requirements and the provision, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), of resources to support their respective requirements for NSEP telecommunications.

To implement the provisions of Executive Order No. 12472, the President directed in National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 201, that "implementation and recurring costs for national level NSEP telecommunications programs (i.e., those which benefit multiple Federal departments, agencies or entities) shall be shared on a pro rata basis determined by each organization's share of NSEP telecommunications requirements." The Director, OMB, subsequently instructed the NCS member organizations to work with the Manager, NCS, to develop the necessary agreements for the payment of member funds to the Office of the Manager, NCS (OMNCS).
