####### Memorandum Opinion and Order,de minimis

(5) Licensees and permittees assigned a DTV channel in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in either ERP in some azimuthal direction or antenna HAAT, or both, that exceed the initial technical facilities specified for the allotment in Appendix B of the(referenced in paragraph (c) of this section), up to the maximum permissible limits on DTV power and antenna height set forth in paragraph (f)(6), (f)(7), or (f)(8) of this section, as appropriate, or up to that needed to provide the same geographic coverage area as the largest station within their market, whichever would allow the largest service area. Such requests must be accompanied by a technical showing that the increase complies with the technical criteria in § 73.623(c), and thereby will not result in new interference exceeding thestandard set forth in that section, or statements agreeing to the change from any co-channel or adjacent channel stations that might be affected by potential new interference, in accordance with § 73.623(f). In the case where a DTV station has been granted authority to construct pursuant to § 73.623(c), and its authorized coverage area extends in any azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage area determined for the DTV allotment reference facilities, then the authorized DTV facilities are to be used in addition to the assumed facilities of the initial DTV allotment to determine protection from new DTV allotments pursuant to § 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV applications filed pursuant to § 73.623(c). The provisions of this paragraph regarding increases in the ERP or antenna height of DTV stations on channels in the initial DTV Table of Allotments shall also apply in cases where the licensee or permittee seeks to change the station's channel as well as alter its ERP and antenna HAAT. Licensees and permittees are advised that where a channel change is requested, it may, in fact, be necessary in specific cases for the station to operate with reduced power, a lower antenna, or a directional antenna to avoid causing new interference to another station.

(6) A DTV station that operates on a channel 2-6 allotment created subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 10 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone I or a maximum ERP of 45 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone II or Zone III. A DTV station that operates on a channel 2-6 allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in power and/or antenna HAAT up to these maximum levels, provided the increase also complies with the provisions of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

(i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to operate with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following table and formulas (the allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the table):

(ii) For DTV stations located in Zone I that operate on channels 2-6 with an HAAT that exceeds 305 meters, the allowable maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

(iii) For DTV stations located in Zone II or III that operate on channels 2-6 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

(7) A DTV station that operates on a channel 7-13 allotment created subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 30 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone I or a maximum ERP of 160 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone II or Zone III. A DTV station that operates on a channel 7-13 allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in power and/or antenna HAAT up to these maximum levels, provided the increase also complies with the provisions of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

(i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to operate with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following table and formulas (the allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the table):

(ii) For DTV stations located in Zone I that operate on channels 7-13 with an HAAT that exceeds 305 meters, the allowable maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

(iii) For DTV stations located in Zone II or III that operate on channels 7-13 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

(8) A DTV station that operates on a channel 14-59 allotment created subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 1000 kW if their antenna HAAT is at or below 365 meters. A DTV station that operates on a channel 14-59 allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in power and/or antenna HAAT up to these maximum levels, provided the increase also complies with the provisions of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

(i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to operates with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following table and formulas (the allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the table):

(ii) For DTV stations located in Zone I, II or III that operate on channels 14-59 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

(2) Unless it conflicts with operation complying with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, where a low power television station or TV translator station is operating on the lower adjacent channel within 32 km of the DTV station and notifies the DTV station that it intends to minimize interference by precisely maintaining its carrier frequencies, the DTV station shall cooperate in locking its carrier frequency to a common reference frequency and shall be responsible for any costs relating to its own transmission system in complying with this provision.

(h)(1) The power level of emissions on frequencies outside the authorized channel of operation must be attenuated no less than the following amounts below the average transmitted power within the authorized channel. In the first 500 kHz from the channel edge the emissions must be attenuated no less than 47 dB. More than 6 MHz from the channel edge, emissions must be attenuated no less than 110 dB. At any frequency between 0.5 and 6 MHz from the channel edge, emissions must be attenuated no less than the value determined by the following formula:

(2) This attenuation is based on a measurement bandwidth of 500 kHz. Other measurement bandwidths may be used as long as appropriate correction factors are applied. Measurements need not be made any closer to the band edge than one half of the resolution bandwidth of the measuring instrument. Emissions include sidebands, spurious emissions and radio frequency harmonics. Attenuation is to be measured at the output terminals of the transmitter (including any filters that may be employed). In the event of interference caused to any service, greater attenuation may be required.
