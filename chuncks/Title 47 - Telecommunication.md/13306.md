(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, a station antenna structure may be erected at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate amateur service communications. (State and local regulation of a station antenna structure must not preclude amateur service communications. Rather, it must reasonably accommodate such communications and must constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish the state or local authority's legitimate purpose.PRB-1, 101 FCC 2d 952 (1985) for details.)

(c) Antennas used to transmit in the 2200 m and 630 m bands must not exceed 60 meters in height above ground level.
