######## Throughput.

(1)Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. System is defined as a base station and all end user units served by that base station. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the AWS licensee is required to provide the BRS licensee with a comparable number of channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the AWS licensee must provide the BRS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). AWS licensees must provide BRS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the BRS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the BRS system.
