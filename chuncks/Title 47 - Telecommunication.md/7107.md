####### Connected device reimbursement and the National Lifeline Accountability Database.

(e)In order to receive Affordable Connectivity Program reimbursement for a connected device, participating providers shall comply with ยง 54.1803(b) and the following requirements:

(1) Such participating provider shall query the National Lifeline Accountability Database to determine whether a prospective connected device benefit recipient has previously received a connected device benefit.

(2) If the National Lifeline Accountability Database indicates that a prospective subscriber has received a connected device benefit, the participating provider shall not seek a connected device reimbursement for that subscriber.

(3) Such participating provider shall not seek a connected device reimbursement for a subscriber that is not receiving the affordable connectivity benefit for service provided by the same participating provider, except that a participating provider may seek reimbursement for a connected device provided to a household if the household had been receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service from that provider at the time the connected device was supplied to the household, but the household subsequently transferred its benefit to another provider before the provider had an opportunity to claim the connected device.

(4) Where two or more participating providers file a claim for a connected device reimbursement for the same subscriber, only the participating provider whose information was received and processed by the National Lifeline Accountability Database or Lifeline Claims System first, as determined by the Administrator, will be entitled to a connected device reimbursement for that subscriber.

(5) All participating providers shall obtain from each subscriber consent to transmit the information required under paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section. Prior to obtaining consent, the participating provider shall describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Affordable Connectivity Program connected device benefit, and that failure to provide consent will result in the subscriber being denied the Affordable Connectivity Program connected device benefit.

(6) In a manner and form consistent with the direction of the Wireline Competition Bureau and the Administrator, a participating provider shall provide to the Administrator information concerning the connected device supplied to the household, including device type, device make, device model, subscriber ID of the household that received the device, date the device was delivered to the household, method used to provide the device (shipped, in store, or installed by provider), market value of the device, and amount paid by the household to the provider for the device. No claim for reimbursement for a connected device supplied by the participating provider to the household shall be submitted prior to payment by the household of the amount described in ยง 54.1803(b)(1).
