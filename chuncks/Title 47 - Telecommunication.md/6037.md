(F) An amount equal to True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charges for the year beginning July 1, 2012.

(iv) Beginning July 1, 2015, a Price Cap Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the CALLS Study Area Base Factor and/or the Non-CALLS Study Area Base Factor, as applicable, multiplied by the sum of the amounts in paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) through (d)(1)(iv)(E) of this section and then adding the amount in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(F) of this section to that amount:
