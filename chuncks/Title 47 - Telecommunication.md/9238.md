####### Unattended operation.

(b)Unattended operation is either the absence of human supervision or the substitution of automated supervision of a station's transmission system for human supervision. In the former case, equipment is employed which is expected to operate within assigned tolerances for extended periods of time. The latter consists of the use of a self-monitoring or ATS-monitored and controlled transmission system that, in lieu of contacting a person designated by the licensee, automatically takes the station off the air within three hours of any technical malfunction which is capable of causing interference.
