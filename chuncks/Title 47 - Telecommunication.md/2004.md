####### Frequency Hopping Systems.

A spread spectrum system in which the carrier is modulated with the coded information in a conventional manner causing a conventional spreading of the RF energy about the frequency carrier. The frequency of the carrier is not fixed but changes at fixed intervals under the direction of a coded sequence. The wide RF bandwidth needed by such a system is not required by spreading of the RF energy about the carrier but rather to accommodate the range of frequencies to which the carrier frequency can hop. The test of a frequency hopping system is that the near term distribution of hops appears random, the long term distribution appears evenly distributed over the hop set, and sequential hops are randomly distributed in both direction and magnitude of change in the hop set.
