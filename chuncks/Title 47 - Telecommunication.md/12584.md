(ii) A lower value for the directional gain than that calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will be accepted if sufficient evidence is presented,, due to shading of the array or coherence loss in the beam-forming.

(3) If a transmitter employs an antenna that operates simultaneously on multiple directional beams using the same or different frequency channels and if transmitted beams overlap, the power shall be reduced to ensure that the aggregate power from the overlapping beams does not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the aggregate power transmitted simultaneously on all beams shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by more than 8 dB.

(4) Transmitters that emit a single directional beam shall operate under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(c) Mobile and portable stations are limited to 1 watt/25 MHz EIRP. In any event, the peak EIRP density shall not exceed 40 milliwatts in any one-megahertz slice of spectrum.
