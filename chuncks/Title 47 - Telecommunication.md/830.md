(a)To ensure the fairness and integrity of its decision-making, the Commission has prescribed rules to regulatepresentations in Commission proceedings. These rules specify "exempt" proceedings, in whichpresentations may be made freely (§ 1.1204(b)), "permit-but-disclose" proceedings, in whichpresentations to Commission decision-making personnel are permissible but subject to certain disclosure requirements (§ 1.1206), and "restricted" proceedings in whichpresentations to and from Commission decision-making personnel are generally prohibited (§ 1.1208). In all proceedings, a certain period ("the Sunshine Agenda period") is designated in which all presentations to Commission decision-making personnel are prohibited (§ 1.1203). The limitations onpresentations described in this section are subject to certain general exceptions set forth in § 1.1204(a). Where the public interest so requires in a particular proceeding, the Commission and its staff retain the discretion to modify the applicablerules by order, letter, or public notice. Joint Boards may modify therules in proceedings before them.
