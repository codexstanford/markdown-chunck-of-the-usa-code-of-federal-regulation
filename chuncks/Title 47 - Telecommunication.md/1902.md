## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Appendix B to Part 1 - Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas
###### i.e.,

i. The antenna, excluding the associated equipment, fits within an enclosure (or if the antenna is exposed, within an imaginary enclosure,one that would be the correct size to contain the equipment) that is no more than three cubic feet in volume, with a cumulative limit of 6 cubic feet if there is more than one antenna/antenna enclosure on the structure; and,

ii. The wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any pre-existing antennas and associated equipment on the structure, but excluding cable runs for the connection of power and other services, are cumulatively no more than 21 cubic feet in volume; and,

3. The replacement of the facilities (including antenna(s) and associated equipment as defined in Stipulation I.A.) does not damage historic materials and permits removal of such facilities without damaging historic materials; and,

4. The depth and width of any proposed ground disturbance associated with the collocation does not exceed the depth and width of any previous ground disturbance (including footings and other anchoring mechanisms). Up to four lightning grounding rods of no more than three-quarters of an inch in diameter may be installed per project, regardless of the extent of previous ground disturbance.

B. A small antenna mounted inside a building or non-tower structure and subject to the provisions of this Stipulation VIII is to be installed in a way that does not damage historic materials and permits removal of such facilities without damaging historic materials.
