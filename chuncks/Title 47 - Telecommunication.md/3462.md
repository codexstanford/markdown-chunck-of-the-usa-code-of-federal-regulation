####### Content.

(ii)An Environmental Request must state why the interested person or entity believes that the proposed antenna structure or physical modification of an existing antenna structure may have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment for which an Environmental Assessment must be considered by the Commission as required by ยง 1.1307 of this chapter, or why an Environmental Assessment submitted by the prospective Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) applicant does not adequately evaluate the potentially significant environmental effects of the proposal. The Request must be submitted as a written petition filed electronically, setting forth in detail the reasons supporting Requester's contentions. If the filer is unable to submit electronically, or if filing electronically would be unreasonably burdensome, the Request may be submitted by mail, with a request for waiver under ยง 1.1304(b) of this chapter.
