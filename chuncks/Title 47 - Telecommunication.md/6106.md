If performance problems are identified by a telecommunications industry participant, the NANC, B&C Agent or NANPA shall investigate and report within 10 business days of notice to the participant of corrective action, if any, taken or to be taken. The NANPA, B&C Agent or NANC (as appropriate) shall be permitted reasonable time to take corrective action, including the necessity of obtaining the required consent of the Commission.
