###### ยง 73.757 System specifications for single-sideband (SSB) modulated emissions in the HF broadcasting service.
####### Equivalent sideband power.

(2)When the carrier reduction relative to peak envelope power is 6 dB, an equivalent SSB emission is one giving the same audio-frequency signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver output as the corresponding DSB emission, when it is received by a DSB receiver with envelope detection. This is achieved when the sideband power of the SSB emission is 3 dB larger than the total sideband power of the DSB emission. (The peak envelope power of the equivalent SSB emission and the carrier power are the same as that of the DSB emission.)
