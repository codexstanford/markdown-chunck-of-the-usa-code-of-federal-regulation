###### ยง 27.64 Protection from interference.

Wireless Communications Service (WCS) stations operating in full accordance with applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of their authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If the FCC determines, however, that interference which significantly interrupts or degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, require modifications to any WCS station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
