######## Timing.

(a)On the day that a PCS entity files its prior coordination notice (PCN) in accordance with ยง 101.103(d) of this chapter, it must file a copy of the PCN with the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and notify the PCS entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. When the PCS entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must pay directly to the PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent the amount owed within thirty days, with the exception of those businesses that qualify for installment payments. A business that qualifies for an installment payment plan must make its first installment payment within thirty days of notice from the clearinghouse. UTAM's first payment will be due thirty days after its reimbursement obligation is triggered, as described in ยง 24.247(b).
