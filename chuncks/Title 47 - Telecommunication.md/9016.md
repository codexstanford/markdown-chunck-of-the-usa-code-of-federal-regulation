####### Embedded commercials-safe harbor.,i.e.

(3)With respect to embedded commercials, which, for the purposes of this provision, are those commercial advertisements placed into the programming stream by a third party (, programmer) and passed through by the station to viewers, a television broadcast station must certify that its own transmission equipment is not at fault for any pattern or trend of complaints, and may demonstrate compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP through one of the following methods:

(i) Relying on a network's or other programmer's certification of compliance with the ATSC A/85 RP with respect to commercial programming, provided that:

(A) The certification is widely available by Web site or other means to any television broadcast station, cable operator, or multichannel video programming distributor that transmits that programming; and

(B) The television broadcast station has no reason to believe that the certification is false; and

(C) The television broadcast station performs a spot check, as defined in § 73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on programming in response to an enforcement inquiry concerning a pattern or trend of complaints regarding commercials contained in that programming.

(ii) If transmitting any programming that is not certified as described in § 73.682(e)(3)(i), a television broadcast station that had more than $14,000,000 in annual receipts for the calendar year 2011 must perform annual spot checks, as defined in § 73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (C), and (E), of all the non-certified commercial programming it receives from a network or other programmer and perform a spot check, as defined in § 73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on programming in response to an enforcement inquiry concerning a pattern or trend of complaints regarding commercials contained in that programming;

(iii) A television broadcast station that had $14,000,000 or less in annual receipts for the year 2011 need not perform annual spot checks but must perform a spot check, as defined in § 73.682(e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), (D), and (E), on programming in response to an enforcement inquiry concerning a pattern or trend of complaints regarding commercials contained in that programming.

(iv) For purposes of this section, a "spot check" of embedded commercials requires monitoring 24 uninterrupted hours of programming with an audio loudness meter employing the measurement technique specified in the ATSC A/85 RP, and reviewing the records from that monitoring to detect any commercials transmitted in violation of the ATSC A/85 RP. The television broadcast station must not inform the network or programmer of the spot check prior to performing it.

(A) Spot-checking must be conducted after the signal has passed through the television broadcast station's processing equipment (e.g., at the output of a television receiver). If a problem is found, the television broadcast station must determine the source of the noncompliance.

(B) To be considered valid, the television broadcast station must demonstrate appropriate maintenance records for the audio loudness meter.

(C) With reference to the annual "safe harbor" spot check in § 73.682(e)(3)(ii):
