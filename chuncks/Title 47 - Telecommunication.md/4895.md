####### Base and fixed stations.

(1)(i) For base and fixed stations transmitting in the 2305-2315 MHz band or the 2350-2360 MHz band:

(A) The average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) must not exceed 2,000 watts within any 5 megahertz of authorized bandwidth and must not exceed 400 watts within any 1 megahertz of authorized bandwidth.

(B) The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitter output power must not exceed 13 dB. The PAPR measurements should be made using either an instrument with complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) capabilities to determine that PAPR will not exceed 13 dB for more than 0.1 percent of the time or other Commission approved procedure. The measurement must be performed using a signal corresponding to the highest PAPR expected during periods of continuous transmission.

(ii) For base and fixed stations transmitting in the 2315-2320 MHz band or the 2345-2350 MHz band, the peak EIRP must not exceed 2,000 watts.
