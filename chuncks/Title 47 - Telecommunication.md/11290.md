######## Service requirements for all ship stations.

(b)(1) Each ship station must receive and acknowledge all communications which are addressed to the ship or to any person on board.

(2) Every ship, on meeting with any direct danger to the navigation of other ships such as ice, a derelict vessel, a tropical storm, subfreezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe icing on superstructures, or winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received, must transmit related information to ships in the vicinity and to the authorities on land unless such action has already been taken by another station. All such radio messages must be preceded by the safety signal.

(3) A ship station may accept communications for retransmission to any other station in the maritime mobile service. Whenever such messages or communications have been received and acknowledged by a ship station for this purpose, that station must retransmit the message as soon as possible.
