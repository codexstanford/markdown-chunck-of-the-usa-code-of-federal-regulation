####### Service substitution.

(b)(1) A request by an applicant to substitute equipment or service for one identified on its FCC Form 471 must be in writing.

(2) The Administrator shall approve such written request where:

(i) The equipment or service has the same functionality; and

(ii) This substitution does not violate any contract provisions or state, local, or Tribal procurement law.

(3) In the event that an equipment or service substitution results in a change in the amount of support, support shall be based on the lower of either the price for the equipment or service for which support was originally requested or the price of the new, substituted equipment or service. Reimbursement for substitutions shall only be provided after the Administrator has approved a written request for substitution.
