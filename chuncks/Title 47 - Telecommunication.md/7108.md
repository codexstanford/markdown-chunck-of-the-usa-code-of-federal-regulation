####### Annual eligibility re-certification.

(f)(1) Participating providers shall re-certify annually all Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers whose initial eligibility was verified through the participating provider's approved alternative verification process or through a school, except where the Administrator using the National Verifier is responsible for the annual recertification of Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers. The Administrator using the National Verifier will re-certify the eligibility of all other Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers. Affordable Connectivity Program subscribers who are also enrolled in Lifeline may rely on a successful recertification for the Lifeline program to satisfy this requirement.

(2) In order to recertify a subscriber's eligibility for the Affordable Connectivity Program, a participating provider shall confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive an affordable connectivity benefit by following the eligibility process and requirements under paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section and shall also follow the requirements and processes for either its alternative verification processes approved under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the eligibility verification processes and requirements for school-based eligibility verifications in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, confirming that the subscriber still meets the program or income-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review.

(3) Where the Administrator is responsible for re-certification of a subscriber's Affordable Connectivity Program eligibility, the Administrator shall confirm a subscriber's current eligibility to receive Affordable Connectivity Program service by:

(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility databases, confirming that the subscriber still meets the program-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review; or

(ii) Querying the appropriate income databases, confirming that the subscriber continues to meet the income-based eligibility requirements for the Affordable Connectivity Program, and documenting the results of that review; or

(iii) If the subscriber's program-based or income-based eligibility for the Affordable Connectivity Program cannot be determined by accessing one or more eligibility or income databases, then the Administrator shall obtain a signed certification from the subscriber confirming the subscriber's continued eligibility. If the subscriber's eligibility was previously confirmed through an eligibility or income database during enrollment or a prior recertification and the subscriber is no longer included in any eligibility or income database the Administrator shall obtain both an approved Annual Recertification Form and acceptable documentation demonstrating eligibility from that subscriber to complete the recertification process.

(4) Where the Administrator is responsible for re-certification of subscribers' Affordable Connectivity Program eligibility, the Administrator shall provide to each provider the results of its annual re-certification efforts with respect to that provider's subscribers.

(5) If a provider is unable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by the Administrator that it is unable to re-certify a subscriber, the provider shall comply with the de-enrollment requirements provided for in ยง 54.1809(d).

(6) One-Per-Household Worksheet-at re-certification, if the subscriber resides at the same address as another Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber and there are changes to the subscriber's household relevant to whether the subscriber is only receiving one affordable connectivity benefit per household, then the subscriber shall complete a new Household Worksheet. Providers must retain the one-per-household worksheet for subscribers subject to this requirement in accordance with ยง 54.1811.
