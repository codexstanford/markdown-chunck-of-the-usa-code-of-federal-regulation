###### § 51.909 Transition of rate-of-return carrier access charges.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, on December 29, 2011, a Rate-of-Return Carrier shall:

(1) Cap the rates for all rate elements for services contained in the definitions of End Office Access Service, Tandem Switched Transport Access Service, and Dedicated Transport Access Service, as well as all other interstate switched access rate elements, in its interstate switched access tariffs at the rate that was in effect on the December 29, 2011; and

(2) Cap, in accordance with § 51.505(b)(2), the rates for rate all elements in its intrastate switched access tariffs associated with the provision of terminating End Office Access Service and terminating Tandem-Switched Transport Access Service at the rates that were in effect on the December 29, 2011,

(i) Using the terminating rates if specifically identified; or

(ii) Using the rate for the applicable rate element if the tariff does not distinguish between originating and terminating.

(3) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(4) of this section, nothing in this section obligates or allows a Rate-of-Return Carrier that has intrastate rates lower than its functionally equivalent interstate rates to make any intrastate tariff filing or intrastate tariff revisions raising such rates.

(4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a Rate-of-Return Carrier enters or exits the National Exchange Carrier Association (Association), as defined in § 69.2(d) of this chapter, traffic-sensitive tariff pursuant to the provisions of § 69.3(e)(6) of this chapter, the Association shall adjust its switched access rate caps referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(i) For each entering Rate-of-Return Carrier, the Association shall:

(A) Determine each entering Rate-of-Return Carrier's interstate switched access revenues for the preceding calendar year;

(B) Determine the revenues that would have been realized by the entering Rate-of-Return Carrier in the preceding calendar year if it had used the Association's switched access rates (employing the rates for the appropriate bands) as of December 31 of the preceding year and the entering Rate-of-Return Carrier's switched access demand used to determine switched access revenues under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section; and

(C) Subtract the sum of the revenues determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section from the sum of the revenues determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.

(ii) The Association shall determine the amount by which each exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier is a net contributor or net recipient to or from the switched access segment of the Association pool as follows:

(A) The Association shall calculate the difference between each exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier's 2011-2012 tariff year projected interstate switched access revenues excluding Local Switching Support and the Rate-of-Return Carrier's projected switched access pool settlements excluding Local Switching Support for the same period with a net contribution amount being treated as a positive amount and a net recipient amount being treated as a negative amount. The Association shall divide the calculated difference by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's 2011-2012 tariff year projected interstate switched access revenues excluding Local Switching Support to produce a percent net contribution or net receipt factor.

(B) The Association shall multiply the factor calculated in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's switched access revenues for the preceding calendar year to yield the amount of the Rate-of-Return Carrier's net contribution or net receipts for the calendar year.

(iii) To determine the Association's adjusted switched access rate caps, the Association shall:

(A) Add the amounts calculated under paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section;

(B) Divide the amount determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section by the preceding year's switched access revenues of the Rate-of-Return Carriers that will participate in the Association traffic-sensitive tariff for the next annual tariff period;

(C) The Association shall proportionately adjust its June 30 switched access rate caps by the percentage amount determined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.

(iv) The interstate switched access rate caps determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of this section shall be the new capped interstate switched access rates for purposes of § 51.909(a). The Association shall provide support in its annual access tariff filing to justify the revised interstate switched access rate caps, the Access Recovery Charges that will be assessed, and the amount of Connect America Fund ICC support each carrier will be eligible to receive.

(5) A Rate-of-Return Carrier exiting the Association traffic-sensitive tariff pursuant to § 69.3(e)(6) of this chapter must establish new switched access rate caps as follows:

(i) The Rate-of-Return Carrier shall multiply the factor determined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section by negative one and then proportionately adjust the Association's capped switched access rates as of the date preceding the effective date of the exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier's next annual tariff filing by this percentage. A Rate-of-Return Carrier that was a net contributor to the pool will have rate caps that are lower than the Association's switched access rate caps, while a net recipient will have switched access rate caps that are higher than the Association's switched access rate caps;

(ii) The interstate switched access rate caps determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section shall be the new capped interstate switched access rates of the exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier for purposes of § 51.909(a). An exiting Rate-of-Return Carrier shall provide support in its annual access tariff filing to justify the revised interstate switched access rate caps, the Access Recovery Charges that will be assessed, and the amount of Connect America Fund ICC support the carrier will be eligible to receive.

(6) If the Association revises its interstate switched access rate caps pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, each Rate-of-Return Carrier participating in the upcoming annual Association traffic-sensitive tariff shall:

(i) Revise any of its intrastate switched access rates that would have reached parity with its interstate switched access rates in 2013 to parity with the revised interstate switched access rate levels;

(ii) The Association shall provide Rate-of-Return Carriers that are participating in the Association traffic-sensitive pool with notice of any revisions the Association proposes under paragraph (a)(4) of this section no later than May 1.
