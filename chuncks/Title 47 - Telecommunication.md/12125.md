(d)(1) The maximum allowable station ERP is dependent upon the station's antenna HAAT and required service area and will be authorized in accordance with table 1. Applicants requesting an ERP in excess of that listed in table 1 must submit an engineering analysis based upon generally accepted engineering practices and standards that includes coverage contours to demonstrate that the requested station parameters will not produce coverage in excess of that which the applicant requires.

(2) Applications for stations where special circumstances exist that make it necessary to deviate from the ERP and antenna heights in Table 1 will be submitted to the frequency coordinator accompanied by a technical analysis, based upon generally accepted engineering practices and standards, that demonstrates that the requested station parameters will not produce a signal strength in excess of 37 dBu at any point along the edge of the requested service area. The coordinator may then recommend any ERP appropriate to meet this condition.

(3) An applicant for a station with a service area radius greater than 40 km (25 mi) must justify the requested service area radius, which will be authorized only in accordance with table 1, note 4. For base stations with service areas greater than 80 km, all operations 80 km or less from the base station will be on a primary basis and all operations outside of 80 km from the base station will be on a secondary basis and will be entitled to no protection from primary operations.
