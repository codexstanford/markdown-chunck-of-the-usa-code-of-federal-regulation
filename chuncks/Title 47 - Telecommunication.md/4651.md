###### ยง 25.218 Off-axis EIRP density envelopes for FSS earth stations transmitting in certain frequency bands.
####### Digital earth station operation in the extended Ku-band.

(h)(1) For co-polarized transmissions in the plane tangent to the GSO arc:

(2) For co-polarized transmissions in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc:

(3) For cross-polarized transmissions in the plane tangent to the GSO arc and in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc:

(4) A license application for earth station operation in a network using variable power density control of earth stations transmitting simultaneously in shared frequencies to the same target satellite receiving beam may be routinely processed if the applicant certifies that the aggregate off-axis EIRP density from all co-frequency earth stations transmitting simultaneously to the same target satellite receiving beam, not resulting from colliding data bursts transmitted pursuant to a contention protocol, will not exceed the off-axis EIRP density limits permissible for a single earth station, as specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section.
