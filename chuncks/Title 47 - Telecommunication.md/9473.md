The applicant may file an opposition within 15 days after the Petition to Deny is filed. In cases in which the minimum diversity preference provided for in § 1.1623(f)(1) has been applied, an "objection to diversity claim" and opposition thereto, may be filed against any applicant receiving a diversity preference, within the same time period provided herein for Petitions and Oppositions. In all pleadings, allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by appropriate certification. However, the FCC may announce, by the Public Notice announcing the acceptance of the last-filed mutually exclusive application, that a notice of Petition to Deny will be required to be filed no later than 30 days after issuance of the Public Notice.

(d) A party in interest may file a Petition to Deny any application that proposes reclassification of a Class C authorization to Class C0 not later than 30 days after issuance of an order to show cause by the Commission notifying the affected licensee of the proposed reclassification.

(e) Untimely Petitions to Deny, as well as other pleadings in the nature of a Petition to Deny, and any other pleadings or supplements which do not lie as a matter of law or are otherwise procedurally defective, are subject to return by the FCC's staff without consideration.
