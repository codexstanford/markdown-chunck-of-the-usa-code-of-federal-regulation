####### Transition Plan.

(d)Eligible space station operators must file with the Commission in GN Docket No. 18-122 no later than June 12, 2020, a Transition Plan that describes the actions that must be taken to clear transponders on space stations and to migrate and filter earth stations. Eligible space station operators must make any necessary updates or resolve any deficiencies in their individual Transition Plans by August 14, 2020.

(1) The Transition Plan must detail the eligible space station operator's individual timeline and necessary actions for clearing its transponders from the 3700-4000 MHz band, including:

(i) All existing space stations with operations that will need to be transitioned to operations above 4000 MHz;

(ii) The number of new satellites, if any, that the space station operator will need to launch in order to maintain sufficient capacity post-transition, including detailed descriptions of why such new satellites are necessary;

(iii) The specific grooming plan for migrating existing services above 4000 MHz, including the pre- and post-transition frequencies that each customer will occupy;

(iv) Any necessary technology upgrades or other solutions, such as video compression or modulation, that the space station operator intends to implement;

(v) The number and location of incumbent earth stations antennas currently receiving the space station operator's transmissions that will need to be transitioned above 4000 MHz;

(vi) An estimate of the number and location of incumbent earth station antennas that will require retuning and/or repointing in order to receive content on new transponder frequencies post-transition; and

(vii) The specific timeline by which the space station operator will implement the actions described in its plan including any commitments to satisfy an early clearing.

(2) To the extent that incumbent earth stations are not accounted for in eligible space station operators' Transition Plans, the Relocation Coordinator must prepare an Earth Station Transition Plan for such incumbent earth stations and may require each associated space station operator to file the information needed for such a plan with the Relocation Coordinator.

(i) Where space station operators do not elect to clear by the accelerated relocation deadlines and therefore are not responsible for earth station relocation, the Earth Station Transition Plan must provide timelines that ensure all earth station relocation is completed no later than the relocation deadline.

(ii) The Relocation Coordinator will describe and recommend the respective responsibility of each party for earth station migration and filtering obligations in the Earth Station Transition Plan and assist incumbent earth stations in transitioning including, for example, by installing filters or hiring a third party to install such filters to the extent necessary.
