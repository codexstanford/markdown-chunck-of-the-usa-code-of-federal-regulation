(2) The following adjustment to population may be made: up to 1,000 persons may be subtracted from the population within the predicted interference area if, for each person subtracted, the applicant effectively installs one filter within 90 days after commencing program tests and, no later than 45 days thereafter, provides the affected TV Channel 6 station with a certification containing sufficient information to permit verification of such installation. The required number of filters will be installed on television receivers located within the predicted interference area.
