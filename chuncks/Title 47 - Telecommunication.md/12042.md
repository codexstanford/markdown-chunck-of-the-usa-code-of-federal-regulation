####### Industrial/Business Pool frequencies.

(b)(1) The following table indicates frequencies available for assignment to Industrial/Business Pool stations, together with the class of station(s) to which they are normally assigned, the specific assignment limitations which are explained in paragraph (b) of this section, and the certified frequency coordinator for each frequency:

(2) Unless otherwise specified, coordination of frequencies in the Industrial/Business pool must be done in accordance with the following:

(i) Unless specified elsewhere in this part, frequencies without any coordinator specified in the Coordinator column of paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be coordinated by any frequency coordinator certified in the Industrial/Business Pool.

(ii) A letter symbol in the Coordinator column of the frequency table in paragraph (b)(3) of this section designates the mandatory certified frequency coordinator for the associated frequency in the table. However, any coordinator certified in the Industrial/Business Pool may coordinate applications on such frequencies provided the prior written consent of the designated coordinator is obtained. Frequencies for which two coordinators are listed may be coordinated by either of the listed coordinators.

(iii) For frequencies above 150 MHz, applications for new or modified facilities on frequencies shared prior to radio service consolidation by the former Manufacturers Radio Service, the Forest Products Radio Service, the Power Radio Service, the Petroleum Radio Service, the Motor Carrier Radio Service, the Railroad Radio Service, the Telephone Maintenance Radio Service and the Automobile Emergency Radio Service may be coordinated by any certified Industrial/Business Pool coordinator. However, in the event that the interference contour of a proposed station would overlap the service contour of an existing station licensed on one of these previously shared frequencies, the written concurrence of the coordinator associated with the industry for which the existing station license was issued, or the written concurrence of the licensee of the existing station, shall be obtained. For the purposes of this ยง 90.35, the service contour for UHF stations is the 39 dBu contour; and the interference contour for UHF stations is the 21 dBu contour; the service contour for VHF stations is the 37 dBu contour; and the interference contour for VHF stations is the 19 dBu contour.
