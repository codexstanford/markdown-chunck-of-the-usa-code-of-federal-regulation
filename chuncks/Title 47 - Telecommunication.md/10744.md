(b) The transmitter of a CARS station using FM transmission may be multiplexed to provide additional communication channels for the transmission of standard and FM broadcast station programs and operational communications directly related to the technical operation of the relay system (including voice communications, telemetry signals, alerting signals, fault reporting signals, and control signals). A CARS station will be authorized only where the principal use is the transmission of television broadcast program material or cablecasting:That this requirement shall not apply to LDS stations.

(c) CARS station licenses may be issued to cable television owners or operators or other eligible system owners or operators, and to cooperative enterprises owned by cable television owners or operators or other eligible system owners or operators. Television translator licensees may be members of such cooperative enterprises.

(d) CARS systems shall supply program material to cable television systems, other eligible systems, and translator stations only in the following circumstances.

(1) Where the licensee of the CARS station or system is owner or operator of the cable television systems or other eligible systems supplied with program material; or

(2) Where the licensee of the CARS station or system supplies program material to cable television systems, other eligible systems, or television translator stations either without charge or on a non-profit, cost-sharing basis pursuant to a written contract between the parties involved which provides that the CARS licensee shall have exclusive control over the operation of the CARS stations licensed to him and that contributions to capital and operating expenses are accepted only on a cost-sharing, nonprofit basis, prorated on an equitable basis among all cable television systems or other eligible systems being supplied with program material in whole or in part. Charges for the programming material are not subject to this restriction and cable network-entities may fully charge for their services. Records showing the cost of the service and its nonprofit, cost-sharing nature shall be maintained by the CARS licensee and held available for inspection by the Commission.

(e) The license of a CARS pickup station authorizes the transmission of program material, and related communications necessary to the accomplishment of such transmission, from the scenes of events occurring in places other than a cable television studio or the studio of another eligible system, to the studio, headend, or transmitter of its associated cable television system or other eligible system, or to such other cable television or other eligible systems as are carrying the same program material. CARS pickup stations may be used to provide temporary CARS studio-to-headend links, studio-to-transmitter links, or CARS circuits consistent with this part without further authority of the Commission: Provided, however, That prior Commission authority shall be obtained if the transmitting antenna to be installed will increase the height of any natural formation or manmade structure by more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) and will be in existence for a period of more than 2 consecutive days: And provided, further, That if the transmitting equipment is to be operated for more than 1 day outside of the area to which the CARS station has been licensed, the Commission, the Regional Director for the area in which the station is licensed to operate, and the Regional Director for the area in which the equipment will be temporarily operated shall be notified at least 1 day prior to such operation. If the decision to continue operation for more than 1 day is not made until the operation has begun, notice shall be given to the Commission and the relevant Regional Directors within 1 day after such decision. In all instances, the Commission and the relevant Regional Directors shall be notified when the transmitting equipment has been returned to its licensed area.
