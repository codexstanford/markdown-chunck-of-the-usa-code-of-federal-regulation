####### Erase Display:

(10)In Caption Mode, to clear the screen of all characters (and accompanying background) in response to codes transmitted on line 21. (The caption service provider can accomplish the erasure either by sending an Erase Displayed Memory command or by sending an Erase Non-Displayed Memory command followed by an End of Caption command, effectively making a blank caption "appear".) Display can also be erased by the receiver when the caption memory erasure conditions are met, such as the user changing TV channels.
