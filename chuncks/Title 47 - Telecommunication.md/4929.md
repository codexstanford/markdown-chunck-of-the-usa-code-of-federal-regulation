###### ยง 27.56 Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

A licensee that owns its antenna structure(s) must not allow such antenna structure(s) to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure owner, the FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of this chapter. See ยง 17.6 of this chapter.
