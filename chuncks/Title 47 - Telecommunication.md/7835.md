####### Receives a call directly

(ii)from a provider means the foreign provider directly upstream of the gateway provider in the call path sent the call to the gateway provider, with no providers in-between.

(g) Beginning January 1, 2004, common carriers shall:

(1) When providing local exchange service, provide an annual notice, via an insert in the subscriber's bill, of the right to give or revoke a notification of an objection to receiving telephone solicitations pursuant to the national do-not-call database maintained by the federal government and the methods by which such rights may be exercised by the subscriber. The notice must be clear and conspicuous and include, at a minimum, the Internet address and toll-free number that residential telephone subscribers may use to register on the national database.

(2) When providing service to any person or entity for the purpose of making telephone solicitations, make a one-time notification to such person or entity of the national do-not-call requirements, including, at a minimum, citation to 47 CFR 64.1200 and 16 CFR 310. Failure to receive such notification will not serve as a defense to any person or entity making telephone solicitations from violations of this section.

(h) The administrator of the national do-not-call registry that is maintained by the federal government shall make the telephone numbers in the database available to the States so that a State may use the telephone numbers that relate to such State as part of any database, list or listing system maintained by such State for the regulation of telephone solicitations.

(i)-(j) [Reserved]

(k) Voice service providers may block calls so that they do not reach a called party as follows:

(1) A provider may block a voice call when the subscriber to which the originating number is assigned has requested that calls purporting to originate from that number be blocked because the number is used for inbound calls only.

(2) A provider may block a voice call purporting to originate from any of the following:

(i) A North American Numbering Plan number that is not valid;

(ii) A valid North American Numbering Plan number that is not allocated to a provider by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator or the Pooling Administrator; and

(iii) A valid North American Numbering Plan number that is allocated to a provider by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator or Pooling Administrator, but is unused, so long as the provider blocking the calls is the allocatee of the number and confirms that the number is unused or has obtained verification from the allocatee that the number is unused at the time of the blocking.

(iv) A telephone number that the provider identifies, based on reasonable analytics, as highly likely to be associated with a one-ring scam.

(3) A terminating provider may block a voice call without liability under the Communications Act or the Commission's rules where:

(i) Calls are blocked based on the use of reasonable analytics designed to identify unwanted calls;

(ii) Those analytics include consideration of caller ID authentication information where available;

(iii) A consumer may opt out of blocking and is provided with sufficient information to make an informed decision;

(iv) All analytics are applied in a non-discriminatory, competitively neutral manner;

(v) Blocking services are provided with no additional line-item charge to consumers; and

(vi) The terminating provider provides, without charge to the caller, the redress requirements set forth in paragraph (k)(8) of this section.

(4) A provider may block voice calls or cease to accept traffic from an originating or intermediate provider without liability under the Communications Act or the Commission's rules where the originating or intermediate provider, when notified by the Commission, fails to effectively mitigate illegal traffic within 48 hours or fails to implement effective measures to prevent new and renewing customers from using its network to originate illegal calls. Prior to initiating blocking, the provider shall provide the Commission with notice and a brief summary of the basis for its determination that the originating or intermediate provider meets one or more of these two conditions for blocking.

(5) A provider may not block a voice call under paragraphs (k)(1) through (4), paragraph (k)(11), paragraphs (n)(5) and (6), or paragraph (o) of this section if the call is an emergency call placed to 911.

(6) When blocking consistent with paragraphs (k)(1) through (4), paragraph (k)(11), paragraphs (n)(5) and (6), or paragraph (o) of this section, a provider must making all reasonable efforts to ensure that calls from public safety answering points and government emergency numbers are not blocked.

(7) For purposes of this section, a provider may rely on Caller ID information to determine the purported originating number without regard to whether the call, in fact originated from that number.

(8) Each terminating provider that blocks calls pursuant to this section or utilizes caller ID authentication information in determining how to deliver calls must provide a single point of contact, readily available on the terminating provider's public-facing website, for receiving call blocking error complaints and verifying the authenticity of the calls of a calling party that is adversely affected by information provided by caller ID authentication. The terminating provider must resolve disputes pertaining to caller ID authentication information within a reasonable time and, at a minimum, provide a status update within 24 hours. When a caller makes a credible claim of erroneous blocking and the terminating provider determines that the calls should not have been blocked, or the call delivery decision is not appropriate, the terminating provider must promptly cease the call treatment for that number unless circumstances change. The terminating provider may not impose any charge on callers for reporting, investigating, or resolving either category of complaints, so long as the complaint is made in good faith.

(9) Any terminating provider that blocks calls based on any analytics program, either itself or through a third-party blocking service, must immediately return, and all voice service providers in the call path must transmit, an appropriate response code to the origination point of the call. For purposes of this rule, an appropriate response code is:

(i) In the case of a call terminating on an IP network, the use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) code 603, 607, or 608;

(ii) In the case of a call terminating on a non-IP network, the use of ISDN User Part (ISUP) code 21 with the cause location "user";

(iii) In the case of a code transmitting from an IP network to a non-IP network, SIP codes 607 and 608 must map to ISUP code 21; and

(iv) In the case of a code transmitting from a non-IP network to an IP network, ISUP code 21 must map to SIP code 603, 607, or 608 where the cause location is "user."

(10) Any terminating provider that blocks calls pursuant to an opt-out or opt-in analytics program, either itself or through a third-party blocking service, must provide, at the request of the subscriber to a number, at no additional charge and within 3 business days of such a request, a list of calls to that number, including the date and time of the call and the calling number, that the terminating provider or its designee blocked pursuant to such analytics program within the 28 days prior to the request.

(11) A terminating provider may block calls without liability under the Communications Act and the Commission's rules, without giving consumers the opportunity to opt out of such blocking, so long as:

(i) The provider reasonably determines, based on reasonable analytics that include consideration of caller ID authentication information where available, that calls are part of a particular call pattern that is highly likely to be illegal;

(ii) The provider manages its network-based blocking with human oversight and network monitoring sufficient to ensure that it blocks only calls that are highly likely to be illegal, which must include a process that reasonably determines that the particular call pattern is highly likely to be illegal before initiating blocking of calls that are part of that pattern;

(iii) The provider ceases blocking calls that are part of the call pattern as soon as the provider has actual knowledge that the blocked calls are likely lawful;

(iv) The provider discloses to consumers that it is engaging in such blocking;

(v) All analytics are applied in a non-discriminatory, competitively neutral manner;

(vi) Blocking services are provided with no additional line-item charge to consumers; and

(vii) The terminating provider provides, without line item charge to the caller, the redress requirements set forth in subparagraphs 8 and 9.

(l) A reporting carrier subject to ยง 52.15(f) of this title shall:

(1) Maintain records of the most recent date each North American Numbering Plan (NANP) telephone number allocated or ported to the reporting carrier was permanently disconnected.

(2) Beginning on the 15th day of the month after the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau announces that the Administrator is ready to begin accepting these reports and on the 15th day of each month thereafter, report to the Administrator the most recent date each NANP telephone number allocated to or ported to it was permanently disconnected.

(3) For purposes of this paragraph (l), a NANP telephone number has been permanently disconnected when a subscriber permanently has relinquished the number, or the provider permanently has reversed its assignment of the number to the subscriber such that the number has been disassociated with the subscriber. A NANP telephone number that is ported to another provider is not permanently disconnected.

(4) Reporting carriers serving 100,000 or fewer domestic retail subscriber lines as reported on their most recent Forms 477, aggregated over all the providers' affiliates, must begin keeping the records required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section six months after the effective date for large providers and must begin filing the reports required by paragraph (l)(2) of this section no later than the 15th day of the month that is six months after the date announced by the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau pursuant to paragraph (l)(2).

(m) A person will not be liable for violating the prohibitions in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section by making a call to a number for which the person previously had obtained prior express consent of the called party as required in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) but at the time of the call, the number is not assigned to the subscriber to whom it was assigned at the time such prior express consent was obtained if the person, bearing the burden of proof and persuasion, demonstrates that:

(1) The person, based upon the most recent numbering information reported to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section, by querying the database operated by the Administrator and receiving a response of "no", has verified that the number has not been permanently disconnected since the date prior express consent was obtained as required in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section; and

(2) The person's call to the number was the result of the database erroneously returning a response of "no" to the person's query consisting of the number for which prior express consent was obtained as required in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section and the date on which such prior express consent was obtained.

(n) A voice service provider must:

(1) Upon receipt of a traceback request from the Commission, civil law enforcement, criminal law enforcement, or the industry traceback consortium:

(i) If the provider is an originating, terminating, or non-gateway intermediate provider for all calls specified in the traceback request, the provider must respond fully and in a timely manner;
