####### Applications for DTS.

(f)An application proposing use of a DTS will not be accepted for filing unless it meets all of the following conditions:

(1) The combined coverage from all of the DTS transmitters covers all of the applicant's authorized service area;

(2) Each DTS transmitter's coverage is contained within either the DTV station's Table of Distances area (pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section) or its authorized service area, except where such extension of coverage beyond the station's authorized service area meets the following criteria:

(i) In no event shall the F(50,50) service contour of any DTS transmitter extend beyond that of its reference facility; and

(ii) In no event shall the F(50,10) node-interfering contour of any DTS transmitter, aside from one located at the reference point, extend beyond the F(50,10) reference-interfering contour of its reference facility; and

(iii) In no event shall the F(50,10) reference-interfering contour of a facility at the reference point extend beyond the F(50,10) reference-interfering contour of its reference facility;

(3) Each DTS transmitter's coverage is contiguous with at least one other DTS transmitter's coverage;

(4) The coverage from one or more DTS transmitter(s) is shown to provide principal community coverage as required in ยง 73.625(a);

(5) The "combined field strength" of all the DTS transmitters in a network does not cause interference to another station in excess of the criteria specified in ยง 73.616, where the combined field strength level is determined by a "root-sum-square" calculation, in which the combined field strength level at a given location is equal to the square root of the sum of the squared field strengths from each transmitter in the DTS network at that location.

(6) Each DTS transmitter must be located within either the DTV station's Table of Distances area or its authorized service area.

(g) All transmitters operating under a single DTS license must follow the same digital broadcast television transmission standard.
