####### Final milestone.

(2)Upon notification that the eligible telecommunications carrier has not met a final milestone, the eligible telecommunications carrier will have twelve months from the date of the final milestone deadline to come into full compliance with this milestone. If the eligible telecommunications carrier does not report that it has come into full compliance with this milestone within twelve months, the Wireline Competition Bureau-or Wireless Telecommunications Bureau in the case of mobile carrier participants-will issue a letter to this effect. In the case of Alaska Plan mobile carrier participants, USAC will then recover the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received by that carrier over the support term for the relevant percentage of population. For other recipients of high-cost support, USAC will then recover the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received in the support area for that carrier over the term of support for the relevant number of locations plus 10 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's total relevant high-cost support over the support term for that support area. Where a recipient is unable to demonstrate compliance with a final performance testing milestone, USAC will recover the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received in the support area for the relevant number of locations for that carrier plus 10 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's total relevant high cost-support over the support term for that support area, the total of which will then be multiplied by the percentage of time since the carrier was last able to demonstrate compliance based on performance testing, on a quarterly basis. In the event that a recipient fails to meet a final milestone both for build-out and performance compliance, USAC will recover the total of the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received by that carrier over the support term for the relevant number of locations to which the carrier failed to build out; the percentage of support that is equal to 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received in the support area for the relevant number of locations for that carrier multiplied by the percentage of time since the carrier was last able to demonstrate compliance based on performance testing; and 10 percent of the eligible telecommunications carrier's total relevant high-cost support over the support term for that support area.
