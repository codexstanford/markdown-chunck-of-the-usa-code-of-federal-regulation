###### ยง 27.53 Emission limits.

(a) For operations in the 2305-2320 MHz band and the 2345-2360 MHz band, the power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power P (with averaging performed only during periods of transmission) within the licensed band(s) of operation, in watts, by the following amounts:

(1) For base and fixed stations' operations in the 2305-2320 MHz band and the 2345-2360 MHz band:

(i) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2305 and 2320 MHz and on all frequencies between 2345 and 2360 MHz that are outside the licensed band(s) of operation, and not less than 75 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2320 and 2345 MHz;

(ii) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2300 and 2305 MHz, 70 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2287.5 and 2300 MHz, 72 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2285 and 2287.5 MHz, and 75 + 10 log (P) dB below 2285 MHz;

(iii) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2360 and 2362.5 MHz, 55 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2362.5 and 2365 MHz, 70 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2365 and 2367.5 MHz, 72 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2367.5 and 2370 MHz, and 75 + 10 log (P) dB above 2370 MHz.

(2) For fixed customer premises equipment (CPE) stations operating in the 2305-2320 MHz band and the 2345-2360 MHz band transmitting with more than 2 watts per 5 megahertz average EIRP:

(i) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2305 and 2320 MHz and on all frequencies between 2345 and 2360 MHz that are outside the licensed band(s) of operation, and not less than 75 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2320 and 2345 MHz;

(ii) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2300 and 2305 MHz, 70 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2287.5 and 2300 MHz, 72 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2285 and 2287.5 MHz, and 75 + 10 log (P) dB below 2285 MHz;

(iii) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2360 and 2362.5 MHz, 55 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2362.5 and 2365 MHz, 70 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2365 and 2367.5 MHz, 72 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2367.5 and 2370 MHz, and 75 + 10 log (P) dB above 2370 MHz.

(3) For fixed CPE stations operating in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands transmitting with 2 watts per 5 megahertz average EIRP or less:

(i) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2305 and 2320 MHz and on all frequencies between 2345 and 2360 MHz that are outside the licensed band(s) of operation, not less than 55 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2320 and 2324 MHz and between 2341 and 2345 MHz, not less than 61 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2324 and 2328 MHz and between 2337 and 2341 MHz, and not less than 67 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2328 and 2337 MHz;
