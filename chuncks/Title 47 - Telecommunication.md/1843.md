####### Alternative start dates for the executive branch's initial 120-day review.

(e)(1) In the event that the executive branch has not transmitted the tailored questions to an applicant within thirty (30) days of the Commission's referral of an application, petition, or other filing, the executive branch may request additional time by filing a request in the public record established in all applicable Commission file numbers and dockets associated with the application, petition, or other filing. The Commission, in its discretion, may allow an extension or start the executive branch's 120-day review clock immediately. If the Commission allows an extension and the executive branch does transmit the tailored questions to the applicant, petitioner, or other filer within the authorized extension period, the initial 120-day review period will begin on the date that executive branch determines the applicant's, petitioner's, or other filer's responses to be complete. If the executive branch does not transmit the tailored questions to the applicant, petitioner, or other filer within the authorized extension period, the Commission, in its discretion, may start the initial 120-day review period.

(2) In the event that the executive branch's notification under ยง 1.40002(b) indicates that no tailored questions are necessary, the 120-day initial review period will begin on the date of that notification.
