####### National Emergency Message (EAN).

(a)The National Emergency Message (formerly called the Emergency Action Notification or Presidential alert message) is the notice to all EAS Participants and to the general public that the EAS has been activated for a national emergency. EAN messages that are formatted in the EAS Protocol (specified in § 11.31) are sent from a government origination point to broadcast stations and other entities participating in the National Public Warning System, and are subsequently disseminated via EAS Participants. Dissemination arrangements for EAN messages that are formatted in the EAS Protocol (specified in § 11.31) at the State and local levels are specified in the State and Local Area plans (defined at § 11.21). A national activation of the EAS for a Presidential National Emergency Message with the Event code EAN as specified in § 11.31 must take priority over any other message and preempt it if it is in progress.
