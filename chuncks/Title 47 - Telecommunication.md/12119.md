###### § 90.203 Certification required.
####### Report and Order,

(i) Mobile/portable equipment capable of use in the 806-809/851-854 MHz band segment and submitted for certification thirty or more days after publication of a summary of the(FCC 16-48, released April 25, 2016) in PS Docket 13-209 in themust have the capability to operate in the analog FM mode on the mutual aid channels designated in § 90.617(a)(1).

(j) Except where otherwise specially provided for, transmitters operating on frequencies in the 150-174 MHz and 406-512 MHz bands must comply with the following:

(1) Applications for certification of mobile and portable equipment designed to transmit voice on public safety frequencies in the 150-174 MHz or 450-470 MHz band will be granted only if the mobile/portable equipment is capable of operating in the analog FM mode on the nationwide public safety interoperability channels in the 150-174 MHz band or 450-470 MHz band, as appropriate. (See § 90.20(c), (d)(80) of this part.)

(2) Applications for certification received on or after February 14, 1997 but before January 1, 2005 will only be granted for equipment with the following channel bandwidths:

(i) 12.5 kHz or less for single bandwidth mode equipment or multi-bandwidth mode equipment with a maximum channel bandwidth of 12.5 kHz;

(ii) 25 kHz for multi-bandwidth mode equipment with a maximum channel bandwidth of 25 kHz if it is capable of operating on channels of 12.5 kHz or less; and

(iii) 25 kHz if the equipment meets the efficiency standard of paragraph (j)(3) of this section.

(3) Applications for part 90 certification of transmitters designed to operate on frequencies in the 150.8-162.0125 MHz, 173.2-173.4 MHz, and/or 421-512 MHz bands, received on or after February 14, 1997 must include a certification that the equipment meets a spectrum efficiency standard of one voice channel per 12.5 kHz of channel bandwidth. Additionally, if the equipment is capable of transmitting data, has transmitter output power greater than 500 mW, and has a channel bandwidth of more than 6.25 kHz, the equipment must be capable of supporting a minimum data rate of 4800 bits per second per 6.25 kHz of channel bandwidth.

(4) Applications for part 90 certification of transmitters designed to operate on frequencies in the 150.8-162.0125 MHz, 173.2-173.4 MHz, and/or 421-512 MHz bands, received on or after January 1, 2011, except for hand-held transmitters with an output power of two watts or less, will only be granted for equipment with the following channel bandwidths:

(i) 6.25 kHz or less for single bandwidth mode equipment;

(ii) 12.5 kHz for multi-bandwidth mode equipment with a maximum channel bandwidth of 12.5 kHz if it is capable of operating on channels of 6.25 kHz or less;

(iii) 25 kHz for multi-bandwidth mode equipment with a maximum channel bandwidth of 25 kHz if it is capable of operating on channels of 6.25 kHz or less; and

(iv) Up to 25 kHz if the equipment meets the efficiency standard of paragraph (j)(5) of this section.

(5) Applications for part 90 certification of transmitters designed to operate on frequencies in the 150.8-162.0125 MHz, 173.2-173.4 MHz, and/or 421-512 MHz bands, received on or after January 1, 2011, must include a certification that the equipment meets a spectrum efficiency standard of one voice channel per 6.25 kHz of channel bandwidth. Additionally, if the equipment is capable of transmitting data, has transmitter output power greater than 500 mW, and has a channel bandwidth of more than 6.25 kHz, the equipment must be capable of supporting a minimum data rate of 4800 bits per second per 6.25 kHz of channel bandwidth.

(6) Modification and permissive changes to certification grants.

(i) The Commission's Equipment Authorization Division will not allow adding a multi-mode or narrowband operation capability to single bandwidth mode transmitters, except under the following conditions:

(A) Transmitters that have the inherent capability for multi-mode or narrowband operation allowed in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(4) of this section, may have their grant of certification modified (reissued) upon demonstrating that the original unit complies with the technical requirements for operation; and

(B) New FCC Identifiers will be required to identify equipment that needs to be modified to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(4) of this section.

(ii) All other applications for modification or permissive changes will be subject to part 2 of this chapter.

(7) Transmitters designed only for one-way paging operations may be certified with up to a 25 kHz bandwidth and are exempt from the spectrum efficiency requirements of paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(5) of this section.

(8) The Commission's Equipment Authorization Division may, on a case by case basis, grant certification to equipment with slower data rates than specified in paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(5) of this section, provided that a technical analysis is submitted with the application which describes why the slower data rate will provide more spectral efficiency than the standard data rate.

(9) Transmitters used for stolen vehicle recovery on 173.075 MHz must comply with the requirements of § 90.20(e)(6).

(10) Except as provided in this paragraph, single-mode and multi-mode transmitters designed to operate in the 150-174 MHz and 421-512 MHz bands that operate with a maximum channel bandwidth greater than 12.5 kHz shall not be manufactured in, or imported into, the United States after January 1, 2011, except as follows:

(i) To the extent that the equipment meets the efficiency standard of paragraph (j)(3) of this section, or

(ii) Where operation with a bandwidth greater than 12.5 kHz is specified elsewhere.

(k) For transmitters operating on frequencies in the 220-222 MHz band, certification will only be granted for equipment with channel bandwidths up to 5 kHz, except that certification will be granted for equipment operating on 220-222 MHz band Channels 1 through 160 (220.0025 through 220.7975/221.0025 through 221.7975), 171 through 180 (220.8525 through 220.8975/221.8525 through 221.8975), and 186 through 200 (220.9275 through 220.9975/221.9275 through 221.9975) with channel bandwidths greater than 5 kHz.

(l) Ocean buoy and wildlife tracking transmitters operating in the band 40.66-40.70 MHz or 216-220 MHz under the provisions of § 90.248 shall be authorized under Supplier's Declaration of Conformity pursuant to subpart J of part 2 of this chapter.

(m) Applications for part 90 certification of transmitters designed to operate in in 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz frequency bands will only be granted to transmitters meeting the modulation, spectrum usage efficiency and channel capability requirements listed in §§ 90.535, 90.547, and 90.548.
