####### One-Per-Household Worksheet.

(g)If the prospective subscriber shares an address with one or more existing Lifeline subscribers according to the National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, the prospective subscriber must complete a form certifying compliance with the one-per-household rule upon initial enrollment. Eligible telecommunications carriers must fulfill the requirement in this paragraph (g) by using the Household Worksheet, as provided by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Where state law, state regulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or a state agency requires eligible telecommunications carriers to use state-specific Lifeline enrollment forms, eligible telecommunications carriers may use those forms in place of the Commission's Household Worksheet. At re-certification, if there are changes to the subscriber's household that would prevent the subscriber from accurately certifying to paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, then the subscriber must complete a new Household Worksheet. Eligible telecommunications carriers must mark subscribers as having completed a Household Worksheet in the National Lifeline Accountability Database if and only if the subscriber shares an address with an existing Lifeline subscriber, as reported by the National Lifeline Accountability Database.
