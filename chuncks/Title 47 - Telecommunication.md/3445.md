####### Sensing requirements,Detection threshold.

(c)-(1)(i) The required detection thresholds are:

(A) ATSC digital TV signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 6 MHz bandwidth;

(B) NTSC analog TV signals: -114 dBm, averaged over a 100 kHz bandwidth;

(C) Low power auxiliary, including wireless microphone, signals: -107 dBm, averaged over a 200 kHz bandwidth.

(ii) The detection thresholds are referenced to an omnidirectional receive antenna with a gain of 0 dBi. If a receive antenna with a minimum directional gain of less than 0 dBi is used, the detection threshold shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the minimum directional gain of the antenna is less than 0 dBi. Minimum directional gain shall be defined as the antenna gain in the direction and at the frequency that exhibits the least gain. Alternative approaches for the sensing antenna are permitted, e.g., electronically rotatable antennas, provided the applicant for equipment authorization can demonstrate that its sensing antenna provides at least the same performance as an omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi gain.
