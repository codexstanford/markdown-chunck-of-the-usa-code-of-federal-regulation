####### Exceptions from the environmental notification process.

(1)Completion of the environmental notification process is not required when FCC Form 854 is submitted solely for the following purposes:

(i) For notification only, such as to report a change in ownership or contact information, or the dismantlement of an antenna structure;

(ii) For a reduction in height of an antenna structure or an increase in height that does not constitute a substantial increase in size as defined in paragraph I(E)(1)-(3) of appendix B to part 1 of this chapter, provided that there is no construction or excavation more than 30 feet beyond the existing antenna structure property;

(iii) For removal of lighting from an antenna structure or adoption of a more preferred or equally preferred lighting style. For this purpose lighting styles are ranked as follows (with the most preferred lighting style listed first and the least preferred listed last): no lights; FAA Lighting Styles that do not involve use of red steady lights; and FAA Lighting Styles that involve use of red steady lights. A complete description of each FAA Lighting Style and the manner in which it is to be deployed can be found in the current version of FAA, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Advisory Circular: Obstruction Marking and Lighting, AC 70/7460;

(iv) For replacement of an existing antenna structure at the same geographic location that does not require an Environmental Assessment (EA) under ยง 1.1307(a) through (d) of this chapter, provided the new structure will not use a less preferred lighting style, there will be no substantial increase in size as defined in paragraph I(E)(1)-(3) of appendix B to part 1 of this chapter, and there will be no construction or excavation more than 30 feet beyond the existing antenna structure property;

(v) For any other change that does not alter the physical structure, lighting, or geographic location of an existing structure;
