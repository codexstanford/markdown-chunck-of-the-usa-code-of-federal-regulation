####### ยง 1.318 The taking of depositions.
######## Submission of deposition to witness; changes; signing.

(e)When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition of each witness shall be submitted to him for examination and shall be read to or by him, unless such examination and reading are waiver by the witness and by the parties. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, the illness or absence of the witness, or of his refusal to sign, together with the reason (if any) given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed, unless upon a motion to suppress, the presiding officer holds that the reason given for the refusal to sign requires rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.
