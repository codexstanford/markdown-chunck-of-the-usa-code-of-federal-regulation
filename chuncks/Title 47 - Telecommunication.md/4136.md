###### ยง 22.912 Service area boundary extensions.

This section contains rules governing service area boundary (SAB) extensions. SAB extensions are areas (calculated using the methodology of ยง 22.911) that extend outside of the licensee's Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) boundary into Unserved Area or into the CGSA of a neighboring co-channel licensee. Service within SAB extensions is not protected from interference or capture under ยง 22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension becomes part of the CGSA in compliance with all applicable rules.
