####### Wall imaging system.

(h)A field disturbance sensor that is designed to detect the location of objects contained within a "wall" or to determine the physical properties within the "wall." The "wall" is a concrete structure, the side of a bridge, the wall of a mine or another physical structure that is dense enough and thick enough to absorb the majority of the signal transmitted by the imaging system. This category of equipment does not include products such as "stud locators" that are designed to locate objects behind gypsum, plaster or similar walls that are not capable of absorbing the transmitted signal.
