######## Height benchmarking.

(b)Height benchmarking is defined for pairs of base stations, one in each of two proximate geographic service areas (GSAs). The height benchmark, which is defined in meters (hb) for a particular base station relative to a base station in another GSA, is equal to the distance, in kilometers, from the base station along a radial to the nearest point on the GSA boundary of the other base station squared (D) and then divided by 17. That is, hb () = D/17. A base station antenna will be considered to be within its applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the height in meters of its centerline of radiation above average elevation (HAAE) calculated along the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with ยง 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter does not exceed the height benchmark (hb). A base station antenna will be considered to exceed its applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the HAAE of its centerline of radiation calculated along the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with ยง 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter exceeds the height benchmark (hb).
