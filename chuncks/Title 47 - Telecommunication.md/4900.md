####### Main, booster and base stations.

(1)(i) The maximum EIRP of a main, booster or base station shall not exceed 33 dBW + 10log(X/Y) dBW, where X is the actual channel width in MHz and Y is either 6 MHz if prior to transition or the station is in the MBS following transition or 5.5 MHz if the station is in the LBS and UBS following transition, except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) If a main or booster station sectorizes or otherwise uses one or more transmitting antennas with a non-omnidirectional horizontal plane radiation pattern, the maximum EIRP in dBW in a given direction shall be determined by the following formula: EIRP = 33 dBW + 10 log(X/Y) dBW + 10 log(360/beamwidth) dBW, where X is the actual channel width in MHz, Y is either (i) 6 MHz if prior to transition or the station is in the MBS following transition or (ii) 5.5 MHz if the station is in the LBS and UBS following transition, and beamwidth is the total horizontal plane beamwidth of the individual transmitting antenna for the station or any sector measured at the half-power points.
