(1) On any frequency from the center of the authorized bandwidth fto the edge of the authorized bandwidth f: Zero dB.

(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 2 kHz up to and including 3.75 kHz: 30 + 20(f- 2) dB or 55 + 10 log (P), or 65 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

(3) On any frequency beyond 3.75 kHz removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth fAt least 55 + 10 log (P) dB.
