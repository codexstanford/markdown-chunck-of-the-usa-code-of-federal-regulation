(a)When antennas are installed on a nondirectional AM tower the AM station shall determine the operating power by the indirect method (see ยง 73.51 of this chapter). Upon completion of the installation, antenna impedance measurements on the AM antenna shall be made. If the resistance of the AM antenna changes by more than 2 percent (see ยง 73.45(c)(1) of this chapter), an application on FCC Form 302-AM (including a tower sketch of the installation) shall be filed with the Commission for the AM station to return to direct power measurement.
