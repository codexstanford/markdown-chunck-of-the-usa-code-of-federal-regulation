###### § 54.804 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund application process.
####### Non-compliance.

(4).Authorization to receive Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support is conditioned upon full and timely performance of all of the requirements set forth in this section, and any additional terms and conditions upon which the support was granted.

(i) Failure by a Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recipient to meet its service milestones for the location totals determined by the Connect America Cost Model, or the location total that is adjusted by the Wireline Competition Bureau for those areas where there are fewer locations than the number of locations determined by the Connect America Cost Model, as required by § 54.802 will trigger reporting obligations and the withholding of support as described in § 54.320(d). Failure to come into full compliance during the relevant cure period as described in §§ 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) or 54.320(d)(2) will trigger a recovery action by the Universal Service Administrative Company as described in § 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) or § 54.806(c)(1)(i), as applicable. If the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund recipient does not repay the requisite amount of support within six months, the Universal Service Administrative Company will be entitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of credit and may disqualify the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recipient from the receipt of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support or additional universal service support.

(ii) The default will be evidenced by a letter issued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, or its respective designees, which letter, attached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, shall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter of credit for the entire amount of the standby letter of credit.
