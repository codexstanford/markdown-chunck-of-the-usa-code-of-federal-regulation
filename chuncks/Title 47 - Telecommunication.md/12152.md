(1) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of 4 kHz or less: Zero dB.

(2) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 4 kHz, but no more than 8.5 kHz: At least 107 log (f/4) dB;

(3) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 8.5 kHz, but no more than 15 kHz: At least 40.5 log (f/1.16) dB;

(4) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by a displacement frequency (fin kHz) of more than 15 kHz, but no more than 25 kHz: At least 116 log (f/6.1) dB;

(5) On any frequency removed from the center of the authorized bandwidth by more than 25 kHz: At least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
