####### Technical limits,Fixed and mobile white space devices.

(b)-(1)(i) Technical limits for fixed and mobile white space devices are shown in the table in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and subject to the requirements of this section.

(ii) For operation at EIRP levels of 36 dBm (4,000 mW) or less, fixed and mobile white space devices may operate at EIRP levels between the values shown in the table in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section provided that the conducted power and the conducted power spectral density (PSD) limits are linearly interpolated between the values shown and the adjacent channel emission limit of the higher value shown in the table is met. Operation at EIRP levels above 36 dBm (4,000 mW) but not greater than 40 dBm (10,000 mW) shall follow the requirements for 40 dBm (10,000 mW). Operation at EIRP levels above 40 dBm (10,000 mW) shall follow the requirements for 42 dBm (16,000 mW).

(iii) The conducted power spectral density from a fixed or mobile white space device shall not be greater than the values shown in the table in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) when measured in any 100 kilohertz band during any time interval of continuous transmission.
