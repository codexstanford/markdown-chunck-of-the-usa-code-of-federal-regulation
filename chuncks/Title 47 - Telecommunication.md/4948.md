####### Harmful interference to SDARS operations requiring resolution.

(d)The following conditions will be presumed to constitute harmful interference to SDARS operations from WCS operations in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands and require WCS operators to work cooperatively with SDARS operators to address areas where such power levels are exceeded and harmful interference occurs:

(1) A WCS ground signal level greater than -44 dBm in the upper or lower A or B block, or -55 dBm in the C or D block, present at a location on a roadway, where a test demonstrates that SDARS service would be muted over a road distance of greater than 50 meters; or

(2) A WCS ground signal level exceeding -44 dBm in the upper or lower A or B block, or -55 dBm in the C or D block on a test drive route, which is mutually agreed upon by the WCS licensee and the SDARS licensee, for more than 1 percent of the cumulative surface road distance on that drive route, where a test demonstrates that SDARS service would be muted over a cumulative road distance of greater than 0.5 percent (incremental to any muting present prior to use of WCS frequencies in the area of that drive test).
