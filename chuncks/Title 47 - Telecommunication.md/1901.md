## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Appendix B to Part 1 - Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas
###### i.e.,

a. The antenna, excluding the associated equipment, fits within an enclosure (or if the antenna is exposed, within an imaginary enclosure,one that would be the correct size to contain the equipment) that is no more than three cubic feet in volume, with a cumulative limit of 6 cubic feet if there is more than one antenna/antenna enclosure on the structure;

b. The wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any pre-existing antennas and associated equipment on the structure, but excluding cable runs for the connection of power and other services, are cumulatively no more than 21 cubic feet in volume; and,

c. The depth and width of any proposed ground disturbance associated with the collocation does not exceed the depth and width of any previous ground disturbance (including footings and other anchoring mechanisms). Up to four lightning grounding rods of no more than three-quarters of an inch in diameter may be installed per project, regardless of the extent of previous ground disturbance.

D. A small antenna mounted inside a building or non-tower structure and subject to the provisions of this Stipulation VII is to be installed in a way that does not damage historic materials and permits removal of such facilities without damaging historic materials.

E. Subsequent to the collocation of an antenna, should the SHPO/THPO or Council determine that the collocation of the antenna or its associated equipment installed under the terms of Stipulation VII has resulted in an adverse effect on historic properties, the SHPO/THPO or Council may notify the FCC accordingly. The FCC shall comply with the requirements of Section 106 and the NPA for this particular collocation.

A. An existing small antenna that is mounted on a building or non-tower structure or in the interior of a building that is (1) a historic property (including a designated National Historic Landmark or a property listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places); (2) inside or within 250 feet of the boundary of a historic district; or (3) located on or inside a building or non-tower structure that is over 45 years of age, regardless of visibility, may be replaced without being reviewed through the Section 106 process set forth in the NPA, provided that:

1. The antenna deployment being replaced has undergone Section 106 review, unless either (a) such review was not required at the time that the antenna being replaced was installed, or (b) for deployments on towers, review is not required pursuant to Stipulation III above.

2. The facility is a replacement for an existing facility, and it does not exceed the greater of:

a. The size of the existing antenna/antenna enclosure and associated equipment that is being replaced; or,

b. The following limits for the antenna and its associated equipment:
