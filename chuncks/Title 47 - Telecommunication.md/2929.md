####### Reset.

(9)There shall be a method to automatically or manually reset the decoder to the normal monitoring condition. Operators shall be able to select a time interval, not less than two minutes, in which the decoder would automatically reset if it received an EAS header code but not an end-of-message (EOM) code. Messages received with the EAN Event codes shall disable the reset function so that lengthy audio messages can be handled. The last message received with valid header codes shall be displayed as required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section before the decoder is reset.
