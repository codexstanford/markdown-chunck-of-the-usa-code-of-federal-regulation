###### ยง 101.145 Interference to geostationary-satellites.
####### 12.7 to 13.25 GHz.

(c)No directional transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in this band with EIRP greater than 45 dBW may be aimed within 1.5 degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction.

(d) Methods for calculating the azimuths to be avoided may be found in: CCIR Report No. 393 (Green Books), New Delhi, 1970; in "Radio-Relay Antenna Pointing for controlled Interference With Geostationary-Satellites" by C. W. Lundgren and A. S. May, Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 48, No. 10, pp. 3387-3422, December 1969; and in "Geostationary Orbit Avoidance Computer Program" by Richard G. Gould, Common Carrier Bureau Report CC-7201, FCC, Washington, DC, 1972.
