c.The FCC and Executive Office of the President (EOP) have used their respective authorizations to develop and establish the NSEP TSP System as the one uniform system of priorities for the provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication services, both before and after invocation of the section 706 Presidential war emergency powers. The Federal rules governing the NSEP TSP System have been promulgated by the FCC and OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In those rules, the FCC has requested the EOP to administer the NSEP TSP System before the invocation of section 706 of the Communications Act, Presidential war emergency powers. In this directive, the EOP assigns to the Manager, NCS, both this administrative authority to administer the NSEP TSP System before, and the President's statutory authority to administer the NSEP TSP System after, the invocation of the section 706 Presidential war emergency powers.
