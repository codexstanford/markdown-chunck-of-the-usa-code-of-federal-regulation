(7)The licensee remains responsible for payment of the required regulatory fees that must be paid in advance of its license term (ยง 1.1152). Where, however, regulatory fees are paid annually on a per-unit basis (such as for Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) pursuant to ยง 1.1152), the licensee and spectrum lessee are each required to pay fees for those units associated with its respective operations.
