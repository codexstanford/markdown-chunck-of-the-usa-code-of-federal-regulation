###### Cost-Sharing Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz Bands
####### § 27.1166 Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.
######## Reimbursement for Self-relocating FMS links in the 2130-2150 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz bands.

(f)Where a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent relocates a paired microwave link with paths in the 2130-2150 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz bands, it may not seek reimbursement from MSS operators, but is entitled to reimbursement from the first AWS beneficiary for its actual costs for relocating the paired link, subject to the reimbursement cap in § 27.1164(b). This amount is subject to depreciation as specified in § 27.1164(b). An AWS licensee who is obligated to reimburse relocation costs under this rule is entitled to obtain reimbursement from other AWS beneficiaries in accordance with §§ 27.1164 and 27.1168. For purposes of applying the cost-sharing formula relative to other AWS licensees that benefit from the self-relocation, depreciation shall run from the date on which the clearinghouse issues the notice of an obligation to reimburse the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent.
