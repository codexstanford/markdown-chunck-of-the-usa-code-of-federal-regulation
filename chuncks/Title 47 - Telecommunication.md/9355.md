####### Citizen agreements.

(3)(i)A copy of every written citizen agreement. These agreements shall be retained for the term of the agreement, including any renewal or extension thereof.

(ii) For purposes of this section, a citizen agreement is a written agreement between a broadcast applicant, permittee, or licensee, and one or more citizens or citizen groups, entered for primarily noncommercial purposes. This definition includes those agreements that deal with goals or proposed practices directly or indirectly affecting station operations in the public interest, in areas such as-but not limited to-programming and employment. It excludes common commercial agreements such as advertising contracts; union, employment, and personal services contracts; network affiliation, syndication, program supply contracts, etc. However, the mere inclusion of commercial terms in a primarily noncommercial agreement-such as a provision for payment of fees for future services of the citizen-parties (see "Report and Order," Docket 19518, 57 FCC 2d 494 (1976))-would not cause the agreement to be considered commercial for purposes of this section.
