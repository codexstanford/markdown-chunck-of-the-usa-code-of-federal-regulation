###### ยง 1.8004 Penalty for Failure to Provide the FRN.

(a) Electronic filing systems for filings that require the FRN will not accept a filing without the appropriate FRN. If a party seeks to make an electronic filing and does not have an FRN, the system will direct the party to the CORES website to obtain an FRN.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section or in other Commission rules, filings subject to the FRN requirement and submitted without an FRN will be returned or dismissed.

(c) Where the Commission has not established a filing deadline for an application, a missing or invalid FRN on such an application may be corrected and the application resubmitted. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section or in other Commission rules, the date that the resubmitted application is received by the Commission with a valid FRN will be considered the official filing date.
