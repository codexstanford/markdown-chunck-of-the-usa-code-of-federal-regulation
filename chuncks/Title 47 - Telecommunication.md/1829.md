####### Electrical degrees at the AM frequency.

(b)This term describes the height of a proposed tower as a function of the frequency of a nearby AM station. To compute tower height in electrical degrees, first determine the AM wavelength in meters as described in paragraph (a) of this section. Tower height in electrical degrees is computed as follows: (Tower height in meters)/(AM wavelength in meters) x 360 degrees = Tower height in electrical degrees. For example, if the AM frequency is 1000 kHz, then the wavelength is 300 meters, per paragraph (a) of this section. A nearby tower 75 meters tall is therefore [75/300] x 360 = 90 electrical degrees tall at the AM frequency.
