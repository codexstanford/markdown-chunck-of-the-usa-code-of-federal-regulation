####### ACP measurement procedure.,e.g.,

(7)The following procedures are to be followed for making ACP transmitter measurements. For time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All measurements must be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna. Measurement bandwidth used below implies an instrument that measures the power in many narrow bandwidths (300 Hz) and integrates these powers across a larger band to determine power in the measurement bandwidth.
