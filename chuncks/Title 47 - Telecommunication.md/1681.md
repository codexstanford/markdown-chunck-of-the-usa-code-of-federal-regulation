(4)If E911 obligations apply to the licensee (see ยง 9.10 of this chapter), the licensee retains the obligations with respect to leased spectrum. A spectrum lessee entering into a short-term de facto transfer leasing arrangement is not separately required to comply with any such obligations in relation to the leased spectrum. However, if the spectrum lessee is a Contraband Interdiction System (CIS) provider, as defined in ยง 1.9003, then the CIS provider is responsible for compliance with ยง 9.10(r) regarding E911 transmission obligations.
