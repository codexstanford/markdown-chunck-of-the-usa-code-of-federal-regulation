####### Image channel interference.

(2)Image channel interference within the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the desired channel by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 714 MHz and 50 dB from 714 MHz to 804 MHz. The 60 dB standard applies at 714 MHz. In testing for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be an NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier is unmodulated and 10 dB below the visual carrier. The undesired test signal shall be a CW signal equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz above the visual carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and + 15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to at least ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.
