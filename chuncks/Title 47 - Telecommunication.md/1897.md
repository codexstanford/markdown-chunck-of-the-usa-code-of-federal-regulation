## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Appendix B to Part 1 - Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas
###### i.e.,,i.e.,

a. Each individual antenna, excluding the associated equipment (as defined in the definition of Antenna in Stipulation I.A.), that is part of the collocation must fit within an enclosure (or if the antenna is exposed, within an imaginary enclosure,one that would be the correct size to contain the equipment) that is individually no more than three cubic feet in volume, and all antennas on the structure, including any pre-existing antennas on the structure, must in aggregate fit within enclosures (or if the antennas are exposed, within imaginary enclosures,ones that would be the correct size to contain the equipment) that total no more than six cubic feet in volume; and,

b. All other wireless equipment associated with the structure, including pre-existing enclosures and including equipment on the ground associated with antennas on the structure, but excluding cable runs for the connection of power and other services, may not cumulatively exceed:

i. 28 cubic feet for collocations on all non-pole structures (including but not limited to buildings and water tanks) that can support fewer than 3 providers; or,

ii. 21 cubic feet for collocations on all pole structures (including but not limited to light poles, traffic signal poles, and utility poles) that can support fewer than 3 providers; or,

iii. 35 cubic feet for non-pole collocations that can support at least 3 providers; or,

iv. 28 cubic feet for pole collocations that can support at least 3 providers; or,

6. The depth and width of any proposed ground disturbance associated with the collocation exceeds the depth and width of any previous ground disturbance (including footings and other anchoring mechanisms). Up to four lightning grounding rods of no more than three-quarters of an inch in diameter may be installed per project regardless of the extent of previous ground disturbance.

B. The volume of any deployed equipment that is not visible from public spaces at the ground level from 250 feet or less may be omitted from the calculation of volumetric limits cited in this Section.

C. Subsequent to the collocation of an antenna, should the SHPO/THPO or Council determine that the collocation of the antenna or its associated equipment installed under the terms of Stipulation VI has resulted in an adverse effect on historic properties, the SHPO/THPO or Council may notify the FCC accordingly. The FCC shall comply with the requirements of Section 106 and the NPA for this particular collocation.

A. A small antenna (including associated equipment included in the definition of Antenna in Stipulation I.A.) may be mounted on a building or non-tower structure or in the interior of a building that is (1) a historic property (including a property listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places) or (2) inside or within 250 feet of the boundary of a historic district without being reviewed through the Section 106 process set forth in the NPA, provided that:

1. The property on which the equipment will be deployed is not a designated National Historic Landmark.

2. The antenna or antenna enclosure (including any existing antenna), excluding associated equipment, is the only equipment that is visible from the ground level, or from public spaces within the building (if the antenna is mounted in the interior of a building), and provided that the following conditions are met:

a. No other antennas on the building or non-tower structure are visible from the ground level, or from public spaces within the building (for an antenna mounted in the interior of a building);
