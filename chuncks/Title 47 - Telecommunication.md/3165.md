(4)Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb-like spectrum input with each visual carrier signal individually set at + 15 dBmV from 54 to 550 MHz. The desired input signal is to be an NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier is unmodulated and 10 dB below the visual carrier. Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least seven evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 54 MHz to 550 MHz. In addition, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 51 dB below the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input with each signal individually set at + 15 dBmV from 550 to 804 MHz. Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least three evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 550 MHz to 804 MHz.
