(e) An identification code, recognized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for the 406.0-406.1 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed in each EPIRB unit to establish a unique identification for each EPIRB station. With each marketable EPIRB unit, the manufacturer or grantee must include a postage pre-paid registration card printed with the EPIRB identification code addressed to: NOAA/SARSAT Beacon Registration, NSOF, E/SPO53, 1315 East West Hwy, Silver Spring, MD 20910-9684. The registration card must request the owner's name, address, telephone number, type of ship, alternate emergency contact and other information as required by NOAA. The registration card must also contain information regarding the availability to register the EPIRB at NOAA's online web-based registration database at:In addition, the following statement must be included: "WARNING-failure to register this EPIRB with NOAA before installation could result in a monetary forfeiture being issued to the owner."

(f) To enhance protection of life and property it is mandatory that each 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB be registered with NOAA before installation and that information be kept up-to-date. Therefore, in addition to the identification plate or label requirements contained in §§ 2.925 and 2.926 of this chapter, each 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB must be provided on the outside with a clearly discernible permanent plate or label containing the following statement: "The owner of this 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB must register the NOAA identification code contained on this label with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) whose address is: NOAA/SARSAT Beacon Registration, NSOF, E/SPO53, 1315 East West Hwy, Silver Spring, MD 20910-9684." Vessel owners shall advise NOAA in writing upon change of vessel or EPIRB ownership, transfer of EPIRB to another vessel, or any other change in registration information. NOAA will provide registrants with proof of registration and change of registration postcards.

(g) For 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRBs whose identification code can be changed after manufacture, the identification code shown on the plate or label must be easily replaceable using commonly available tools.
