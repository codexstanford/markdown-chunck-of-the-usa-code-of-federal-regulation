######## Reliability.

(2)System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. AWS licensees must provide BRS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital video transmissions, it is measured by whether the end-to-end transmission delay is within the required delay bound.
