(2) Parties wishing to respond to a FCC Form 1275 filing must submit comments or oppositions via electronic mail (email) at the following address:. The subject line shall read "Open Video System Certification Application Comments." Comments and oppositions will not be considered properly filed unless filed as described in this paragraph (e).

(f) If the Commission does not disapprove the certification application within ten days after receipt of an applicant's request, the certification application will be deemed approved. If disapproved, the applicant may file a revised certification or refile its original submission with a statement addressing the issues in dispute in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section. Such refilings must be served on any objecting party or parties and on all local communities in which the applicant intends to operate pursuant to instructions in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The Commission will consider any revised or refiled FCC Form 1275 to be a new proceeding and any party who filed comments regarding the original FCC Form 1275 will have to refile their original comments if they think such comments should be considered in the subsequent proceeding.
