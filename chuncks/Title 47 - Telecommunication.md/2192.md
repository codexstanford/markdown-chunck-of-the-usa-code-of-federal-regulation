(3) As an exception to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the necessary bandwidth () for such systems is numerically equal to 2or 2+ 2, whichever is greater, provided the following conditions are met:

(i) The modulation index of the main carrier due to the continuity pilot subcarrier does not exceed 0.25, and

(ii) In a radio system of multichannel telephony, the rms frequency deviation of the main carrier due to the continuity pilot subcarrier does not exceed 70 percent of the rms value of the per-channel deviation, or, in a radio system for television, the rms deviation of the main carrier due to the pilot does not exceed 3.55 percent of the peak deviation of the main carrier.
