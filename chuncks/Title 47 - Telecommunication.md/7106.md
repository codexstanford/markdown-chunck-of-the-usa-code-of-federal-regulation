(d)In order to receive Affordable Connectivity Program support, participating providers shall comply with the following requirements:

(1) All participating providers shall query the National Lifeline Accountability Database to determine whether a prospective subscriber is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program supported service from another participating provider; and whether anyone else living at the prospective subscriber's residential address is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service.

(2) If the National Lifeline Accountability Database indicates that a prospective subscriber who is not seeking to transfer his or her affordable connectivity benefit, is currently receiving an Affordable Connectivity Program-supported service, the participating provider shall not provide and shall not seek or receive Affordable Connectivity Program reimbursement for that subscriber.

(3) Participating providers may query the National Lifeline Accountability Database only for the purposes provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) and (e)(1) and (2) of this section, and to determine whether information with respect to its subscribers already in the National Lifeline Accountability Database is correct and complete.

(4) Participating providers shall transmit to the National Lifeline Accountability Database in a format prescribed by the Administrator each new and existing Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber's full name; full residential address; date of birth; the telephone number associated with the Affordable Connectivity Program service; the date on which the Affordable Connectivity Program discount was initiated; the date on which the Affordable Connectivity Program discount was terminated, if it has been terminated; the amount of support being sought for that subscriber; and the means through which the subscriber qualified for the Affordable Connectivity Program.

(5) All participating providers shall update an existing Affordable Connectivity Program subscriber's information in the National Lifeline Accountability Database within ten business days of receiving any change to that information, except as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.

(6) All participating providers shall obtain, from each new and existing subscriber, consent to transmit the subscriber's information. Prior to obtaining consent, the participating provider shall describe to the subscriber, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the Administrator to ensure the proper administration of the Affordable Connectivity Program, and that failure to provide consent will result in subscriber being denied the affordable connectivity benefit.

(7) When a participating provider de-enrolls a subscriber from the Affordable Connectivity Program, it shall transmit to the National Lifeline Accountability Database the date of Affordable Connectivity Program de-enrollment within one business day of de-enrollment.

(8) All participating providers shall securely retain subscriber documentation that the participating provider reviewed to verify subscriber eligibility, for the purposes of production during audits or investigations or to the extent required by National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier processes, which require, inter alia, verification of eligibility, identity, address, and age.

(9) A participating provider shall not enroll or claim for reimbursement a prospective subscriber in the Affordable Connectivity Program if the National Lifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier cannot verify the subscriber's status as alive, unless the subscriber produces documentation to demonstrate his or her identity and status as alive.

(10) A participating provider shall apply the Affordable Connectivity Program benefit no later than the start of the first billing cycle after the household's enrollment or transfer, and pass through the discount to the household prior to claiming reimbursement for the discount in the Affordable Connectivity Program.
