## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 15 - RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES
##### Subpart C - Intentional Radiators
###### Radiated Emission Limits, Additional Provisions
####### ยง 15.256 Operation of level probing radars within the bands 5.925-7.250 GHz, 24.05-29.00 GHz, and 75-85 GHz.
######## Antenna side lobe gain.

(j)LPR devices operating under the provisions of this section must limit the side lobe antenna gain relative to the main beam gain for off-axis angles from the main beam of greater than 60 degrees to the levels provided in Table 2.

(k) Emissions from digital circuitry used to enable the operation of the transmitter may comply with the limits in ยง 15.209 of this chapter provided it can be clearly demonstrated that those emissions are due solely to emissions from digital circuitry contained within the transmitter and the emissions are not intended to be radiated from the transmitter's antenna. Emissions from associated digital devices, as defined in ยง 15.3(k) of this part, e.g., emissions from digital circuitry used to control additional functions or capabilities other than the operation of the transmitter, are subject to the limits contained in subpart B, part 15 of this chapter. Emissions from these digital circuits shall not be employed in determining the -10 dB bandwidth of the fundamental emission or the frequency at which the highest emission level occurs.
