####### Measurement procedure.

(6)Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed; for mobile digital stations, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least two percent may be employed, except when the 1 megahertz band is 2495-2496 MHz, in which case a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e. 1 megahertz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified; or 1 megahertz or 2 percent for mobile digital stations, except in the band 2495-2496 MHz). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. With respect to television operations, measurements must be made of the separate visual and aural operating powers at sufficiently frequent intervals to ensure compliance with the rules.
