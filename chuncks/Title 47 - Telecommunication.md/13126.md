####### Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio.

The Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean power over the assigned Aggregated Channel Bandwidth to the filtered mean power over the equivalent adjacent channel bandwidth. The power in the assigned Aggregated Channel Bandwidth and its equivalent adjacent channel bandwidth are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths equal to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
