####### i.e.

(3) The transmitter shall be equipped to display the digital power output (, average power over a 6 MHz channel) and shall be designed to prevent the power output from exceeding the maximum rated power output under any condition;

(4) When subjected to variations in ambient temperature between 0 and 40 degrees Centigrade and variations in power main voltage between 85% and 115% of the rated power supply voltage, the frequency stability of the local oscillator in the RF channel upconverter shall be maintained within 10 kHz of the nominal value; and

(5) The transmitter shall be equipped with suitable meters and jacks so that appropriate voltage and current measurements may be made while the transmitter is in operation.

(c) The following additional requirements apply to digital heterodyne translators:

(1) The maximum rated power output (digital average power over a 6 MHz channel) shall not exceed 30 watts for transmitters operating on channels 14-51 and 3 watts for transmitters operating on channels 2-13; and

(2) The transmitter shall contain circuits which will maintain the digital average power output constant within 1 dB when the strength of the input signal is varied over a range of 30 dB.

(d) Certification will be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that the transmitter is capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, pursuant to the procedures described in ยง 74.750(e).
