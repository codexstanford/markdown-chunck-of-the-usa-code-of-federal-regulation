####### Less congested area.,i.e.,

Geographic areas where at least half of the TV channels within a specific TV band are unused for broadcast and other protected services and available for white space device use. Less congested areas are determined separately for each TV band-the low VHF band (channels 2-6), the high VHF band (channels 7-13) and the UHF band (channels 14-36);one, two or all three bands or any combination could qualify as less congested. White space devices may only operate at the levels permitted for less congested areas within the area and the specific TV band(s) that qualify as a less congested area. For the purpose of this definition, a channel is considered available for white space device use if it is available for fixed devices operating with 40 milliwatts EIRP at 3 meters HAAT. Less congested areas in the UHF TV band are also considered to be less congested areas in the 600 MHz service band.
