### PART 211 - EMERGENCY RESTORATION PRIORITY PROCEDURES FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
#### ยง 211.5 Priorities.
##### Priority 2.

(b)Priority 2 shall be the second highest level of restoration priority, and shall be afforded only to Federal and Foreign Government private line services, and to Industrial/Commercial services which are designated for prearranged voluntary participation with the Federal Government in a national emergency. Circuit requirements in this level shall be limited to those essential, at a time when nuclear attack threatens, to maintain an optimum defense posture and to give civil alert to the U.S. population. These are circuit requirements whose unavailability would present serious dangers:

(1) Reducing significantly the preparedness of U.S. defense and retalitory forces;

(2) Affecting adversely the ability of the United States to conduct critical preattack diplomatic negotiations to reduce or limit the threat of war;

(3) Interfering with the effectual direction of the U.S. population in the interest of civil defense and survival;

(4) Weakening U.S. capability to accomplish critical national internal security functions;

(5) Inhibiting the provision of essential Federal Government functions necessary to meet a preattack situation.
