(n)The rule applicable with regard to long-termtransfer leasing arrangements (ยง 1.9030(l)) applies in the same manner to short-termtransfer leasing arrangements, except that the renewal of the short-termtransfer leasing arrangement to extend into the term of the renewed license authorization cannot enable the combined terms of the short-termtransfer leasing arrangements to exceed one year. The Commission must be notified of the renewal of the spectrum leasing arrangement at the same time that the licensee submits its application for license renewal (ยง 1.949).
