####### Exceptions to frequency monitoring in the 401-406 MHz band.

(b)MedRadio devices or communications sessions that meet any one of the following criteria are not required to be operated in accordance with the access rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) MedRadio communications sessions that are initiated by a medical implant event.

(2) MedRadio devices operating in either the 401-401.85 MHz or 405-406 MHz bands, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 250 nanowatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.1%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval, and a maximum of 100 transmissions per hour.

(3) MedRadio devices operating in the 401.85-402 MHz band, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 25 microwatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.1%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval, and a maximum of 100 transmissions per hour.

(4) MedRadio devices operating with a total emission bandwidth not exceeding 300 kHz, centered at 403.65 MHz, provided that the transmit power is not greater than 100 nanowatts EIRP and the duty cycle for such transmissions does not exceed 0.01%, based on the total transmission time during a one-hour interval and a maximum of 10 transmissions per hour.
