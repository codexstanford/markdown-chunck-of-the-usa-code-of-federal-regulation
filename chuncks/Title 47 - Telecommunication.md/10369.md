(iii)In addition to the rate adjustments permitted in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, operators that make channel additions on or after May 15, 1994 may increase their rates by a total of 30 cents per month, per subscriber between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with such channels (the "License Fee Reserve"). The License Fee Reserve may be applied against the initial license fee and any increase in the license fee for such channels during this period. An operator may pass-through to subscribers more than the 30 cents between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with channels added after May 15, 1994, provided that the total amount recovered from subscribers for such channels, including the License Fee Reserve, does not exceed $1.50 per subscriber, per month. After December 31, 1996, license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, except that license fees associated with channels added pursuant to this paragraph (3) will not be eligible for the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs.
