(3) Base station antenna heights may exceed 300 meters HAAT with a corresponding reduction in power;Tables 1 and 2 of this section.

(4) The service area boundary limit and microwave protection criteria specified in §§ 24.236 and 24.237 apply.

(b)(1) Base stations that are located in counties with population densities of 100 persons or fewer per square mile, based upon the most recently available population statistics from the Bureau of the Census, with an emission bandwidth of 1 MHz or less are limited to 3280 watts equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) with an antenna height up to 300 meters HAAT.
