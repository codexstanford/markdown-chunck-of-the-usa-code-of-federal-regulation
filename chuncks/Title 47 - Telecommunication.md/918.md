(4) Both the MPE limits listed in Table 1 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the SAR limits as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are for continuous exposure, that is, for indefinite time periods. Exposure levels higher than the limits are permitted for shorter exposure times, as long as the average exposure over a period not more than the specified averaging time in Table 1 in paragraph (e)(1) is less than (or equal to) the exposure limits. Detailed information on our policies regarding procedures for evaluating compliance with all of these exposure limits can be found in the most recent edition of FCC's"Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields," and its supplements, all available at the FCC's internet website:and in the Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) Laboratory Division Knowledge Database (KDB) ().

(e)(1) Table 1 to ยง 1.1310(e)(1) sets forth limits for Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.
