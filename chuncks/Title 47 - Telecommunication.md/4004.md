####### § 22.657 Transmitter locations.
######## Co-channel protection from base transmitters with high antennas.

(f)This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance between the location of such a base transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles-representing the distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is calculated as follows:

(g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the applicant submits an engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or operation with less effective radiated power would satisfy the applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the Grade B contours of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 dBµV/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using the UHF TV propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.
