An amendment will not require further local or national notice if the only reported change is a reduction in the height of the proposed new or modified antenna structure; if proposed lighting is removed or changed to a more preferred or equally preferred lighting style as set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section; or if the amendment reports only administrative changes that are not subject to the requirements specified in this paragraph. All other changes to the physical structure, lighting, or geographic location data for a proposed registered antenna structure require additional local and national notice and a new period for filing Requests pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section.
