####### Other transmitters.

(3)For all other transmitters authorized under subpart M that operate in the 902-928 MHz band, the peak power of any emission shall be attenuated below the power of the highest emission contained within the licensee's sub-band in accordance with the following schedule:

(i) On any frequency within the authorized bandwidth: Zero dB.

(ii) On any frequency outside the licensee's sub-band edges: 55 + 10 log(P) dB, where (P) is the highest emission (watts) of the transmitter inside the licensee's sub-band.

(4) In the 902-928 MHz band, the resolution bandwidth of the instrumentation used to measure the emission power shall be 100 kHz, except that, in regard to paragraph (2) of this section, a minimum spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth of 300 Hz shall be used for measurement center frequencies with 1 MHz of the edge of the authorized subband. The video filter bandwidth shall not be less than the resolution bandwidth.

(5) Emission power shall be measured in peak values.

(6) The LMS sub-band edges for non-multilateration systems for which emissions must be attenuated are 902.00, 904.00, 909.5 and 921.75 MHz.
