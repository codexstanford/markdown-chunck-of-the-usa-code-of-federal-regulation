####### prcz@naic.edu.

(i) Any applicant for a new permanent transmitting fixed earth station to be located on the island of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, or Culebra, or for modification of an existing authorization to change the frequency, power, antenna height, directivity, or location of such a station on one of these islands in a way that would increase the likelihood of causing interference, must notify the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory, HC3 Box 53995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00612, in writing or electronically, of the technical parameters of the proposal. Applicants may wish to consult interference guidelines, which will be provided by Cornell University. Applicants who choose to transmit information electronically should e-mail to:

(1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the application with the Commission. The notification must specify the geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and gain, proposed frequency, relevant FCC rule part, type of emission, effective radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.

(2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.

(3) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations that transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.

(j) Applicants for NGSO 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service/Radiodetermination-Satellite Service feeder links in the 17.7-20.2 GHz and 27.5-30.0 GHz bands must coordinate with licensees of FSS and terrestrial-service systems sharing the band to determine geographic protection areas around each NGSO MSS/Radiodetermination-Satellite Service feeder-link earth station.

(k) An applicant for operation of an earth station, other than an ESV, VMES or an ESAA, that will operate with a geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite in a shared frequency band in which the non-geostationary system is (or is proposed to be) licensed for feeder links, shall demonstrate in its applications that its proposed earth station will not cause unacceptable interference to any other satellite network that is authorized to operate in the same frequency band, or certify that the operations of its earth station shall conform to established coordination agreements between the operator(s) of the space station(s) with which the earth station is to communicate and the operator(s) of any other space station licensed to use the band.

(l) [Reserved]

(m) Feeder links to DBS space stations:

(1) Each applicant for a license to construct a new FSS earth station to provide feeder-link service to DBS space stations in the frequency band 17.3-17.8 GHz, or to modify any such station currently authorized except where the modification is for a new station within one kilometer of a currently-licensed earth station and modification will not increase the aggregate pfd, measured at any point 3-10 meters above the ground, above that generated by the current earth station, shall identify a coordination zone around its proposed new or modified earth station by the methodology outlined in Annex 3 of Appendix 7 of the ITU Radio Regulations, using the following values for the parameters in Table 9b of Annex 7 of Appendix 7:

(2) Each applicant for such new or modified feeder-link earth station shall provide the following information to a third-party coordinator of its choice for use in coordination required by this paragraph:

(i) The geographical coordinates of the proposed earth station antenna(s);

(ii) Proposed operating frequency band(s) and emission(s);

(iii) Antenna diameter (meters);

(iv) Antenna center height above ground and ground elevation above mean sea level;

(v) Antenna gain pattern(s) in the plane of the main beam;

(vi) Longitude range of geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) satellites at which an antenna may be pointed;

(vii) Horizon elevation plot;

(viii) Antenna horizon gain plot(s) determined in accordance with the procedure in Section 2.1 of Annex 5 to Appendix 7 of the ITU Radio Regulations;

(ix) Minimum elevation angle;

(x) Maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) density in the main beam in any 1 MHz band;

(xi) Maximum available RF transmit power density in any 1 MHz band at the input terminals of the antenna(s);

(xii) A plot of the coordination distance contour(s) and rain scatter coordination distance contour(s) as determined by Table 2 of Section 3 to Appendix 7 of the ITU Radio Regulations.

(3) Each applicant for such new or modified feeder-link earth stations shall file with its application memoranda of coordination with each licensee authorized to construct BSS receive earth stations within the coordination zone.

(n) From December 5, 2021 until December 5, 2030, consolidated telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) operations at no more than four locations may be authorized on a primary basis to support space station operations, and no other TT&C operations shall be entitled to interference protection in the 3.7-4.0 GHz band.
