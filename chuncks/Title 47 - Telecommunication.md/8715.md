###### ยง 73.160 Vertical plane radiation characteristics, f(&#x3B8;).

(a) The vertical plane radiation characteristics show the relative field being radiated at a given vertical angle, with respect to the horizontal plane. The vertical angle, represented as &#x3B8;, is 0 degrees in the horizontal plane, and 90 degrees when perpendicular to the horizontal plane. The vertical plane radiation characteristic is referred to as f(&#x3B8;). The generic formula for f(&#x3B8;) is:

(b) Listed below are formulas for f(&#x3B8;) for several common towers.

(1) For a typical tower, which is not top-loaded or sectionalized, the following formula shall be used:

(2) For a top-loaded tower, the following formula shall be used:

See Figure 1 of this section.

(3) For a sectionalized tower, the following formula shall be used:

See Figure 2 of this section.
