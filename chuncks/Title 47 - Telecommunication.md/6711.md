######## Gift restrictions.

(h)(1) Subject to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) in this section, an eligible health care provider or consortium that includes eligible health care providers, may not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value from a service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the Rural Health Care Program. No such service provider shall offer or provide any such gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value except as otherwise provided in this section. Modest refreshments not offered as part of a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended solely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, including meals, may be offered or provided, and accepted by any individual or entity subject to this rule, if the value of these items received by any individual does not exceed $50 from any one service provider per funding year. The $50 amount for any service provider shall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts provided during a funding year by the individuals specified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) in this section.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) The terms "health care provider" or "consortium" shall include all individuals who are on the governing boards of such entities and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, or independent contractors of such entities involved on behalf of such health care provider or consortium with the Rural Health Care Program, including individuals who prepare, approve, sign, or submit Rural Health Care Program applications, or other forms related to the Rural Health Care Program, or who prepare bids, communicate, or work with Rural Health Care Program service providers, consultants, or with the Administrator, as well as any staff of such entities responsible for monitoring compliance with the Rural Health Care Program; and

(ii) The term "service provider" includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such an entity (such as members of the board of directors), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, or independent contractors of such entities.

(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value, to the extent given to a family member or a friend working for an eligible health care provider or consortium that includes eligible health care providers, provided that such transactions:

(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relationship;

(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider business activities or any other business relationship with any such eligible health care provider; and

(iii) Are provided using only the donor's personal funds that will not be reimbursed through any employment or business relationship.

(4) Any service provider may make charitable donations to an eligible health care provider or consortium that includes eligible health care providers in the support of its programs as long as such contributions are not directly or indirectly related to the Rural Health Care Program procurement activities or decisions and are not given by service providers to circumvent competitive bidding and other Rural Health Care Program rules, including those in ยง 54.611(a), requiring health care providers under the Healthcare Connect Fund Program to contribute 35 percent of the total cost of all eligible expenses.
