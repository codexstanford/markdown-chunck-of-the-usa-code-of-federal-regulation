(i) The states or territories in which the provider plans to participate;

(ii) The service areas in which the provider has the authority, if needed, to operate in each State or territory, but has not been designated an eligible telecommunications carrier; and,

(iii) Certifications of the provider's plan to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, which shall:

(A) Confirm a household's eligibility for the Program through either the National Verifier or a Commission-approved eligibility verification process prior to seeking reimbursement for the respective subscriber;

(B) Follow all enrollment requirements and obtain all certifications as required by the Program, including providing eligible households with information describing the Program's eligibility requirements, one-per-household rule, and enrollment procedures;

(C) Interact with the necessary Administrator systems, including the National Verifier, National Lifeline Accountability Database, and Representative Accountability Database, before submitting claims for reimbursement, including performing the necessary checks to ensure the household is not receiving duplicative benefits within the Program;

(D) De-enroll from the Program any household it has a reasonable basis to believe is no longer eligible to receive the benefit consistent with Program requirements;

(E) Comply with the Program's document retention requirements and agree to make such documentation available to the Commission or USAC, upon request or any entities (for example, auditors) operating on their behalf; and

(F) Agree to the Commission's enforcement and forfeiture authority.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Wireline Competition Bureau shall automatically approve as a participating provider a broadband provider that has an established program as of April 1, 2020, that is widely available and offers internet service offerings to eligible households and maintains verification processes that are sufficient to avoid fraud, waste, and abuse. Such applications seeking automatic approval shall contain:

(i) The States or territories in which the provider plans to participate;

(ii) The service areas in which the provider has the authority, if needed, to operate in each State or territory, but has not been designated an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier; and,
