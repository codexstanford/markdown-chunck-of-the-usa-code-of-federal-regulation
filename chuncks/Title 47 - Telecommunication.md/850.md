(i) In proceedings governed by ยง 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has made available a method of electronic filing, writtenpresentations and memoranda summarizing oralpresentations, and all attachments thereto, shall, when feasible, be filed through the electronic comment filing system available for that proceeding, and shall be filed in a native format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt, searchable .pdf). If electronic filing would present an undue hardship, the person filing must request an exemption from the electronic filing requirement, stating clearly the nature of the hardship, and submitting an original and one copy of the writtenpresentation or memorandum summarizing an oralpresentation to the Secretary, with a copy by mail or by electronic mail to the Commissioners or Commission employees who attended or otherwise participated in the presentation.
