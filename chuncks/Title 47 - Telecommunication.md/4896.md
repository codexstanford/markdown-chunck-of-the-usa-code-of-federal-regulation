####### Fixed customer premises equipment stations.

(2)For fixed customer premises equipment (CPE) stations transmitting in the 2305-2320 MHz band or in the 2345-2360 MHz band, the peak EIRP must not exceed 20 watts within any 5 megahertz of authorized bandwidth. Fixed CPE stations transmitting in the 2305-2320 MHz band or in the 2345-2360 MHz band must employ automatic transmit power control when operating so the stations operate with the minimum power necessary for successful communications. The use of outdoor antennas for CPE stations or outdoor CPE station installations operating with 2 watts per 5 megahertz or less average EIRP using the stepped emissions mask prescribed in ยง 27.53(a)(3) is prohibited except if professionally installed in locations removed by 20 meters from roadways or in locations where it can be shown that the ground power level of -44 dBm in the A or B blocks or -55 dBm in the C or D blocks will not be exceeded at the nearest road location. The use of outdoor antennas for fixed CPE stations operating with 2 watts per 5 megahertz or less average EIRP and the emissions mask prescribed in ยง 27.53(a)(1)(i) through (iii) is permitted in all locations. For fixed WCS CPE using TDD technology, the duty cycle must not exceed 38 percent;
