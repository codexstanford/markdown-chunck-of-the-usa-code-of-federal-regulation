####### e.g.,

(N) The network technology (4G LTE (Long Term Evolution), 5G-NR (New Radio)) and spectrum bands used for the test; and

(O) All other metrics required per the most recent specification for mobile test data adopted by Office of Economics and Analytics and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553.

(2) When a mobile service provider chooses to demonstrate mobile broadband coverage availability by submitting infrastructure data, the mobile service provider must submit such data for all cell sites and antennas that serve or interfere with the targeted area.

(i) Infrastructure data must include the following information for each cell site that the provider uses to provide service for the area subject to the verification inquiry:

(A) The latitude and longitude of the cell site measured with typical GPS Standard Positioning Service accuracy or better;

(B) The cell and site ID number for each cell site;

(C) The ground elevation above mean sea level (AMSL) of the site (in meters);

(D) Frequency band(s) used to provide service for each site being mapped including channel bandwidth (in megahertz);

(E) Radio technologies used on each band for each site;

(F) Capacity (megabits per second (Mbps)) and type of backhaul used at each cell site;

(G) Number of sectors at each cell site;

(H) Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP, in decibel-milliwatts (dBm)) of the sector at the time the mobile provider creates its map of the coverage data;

(I) Geographic coordinates of each transmitter site measured with typical GPS Standard Positioning Service accuracy or better;
