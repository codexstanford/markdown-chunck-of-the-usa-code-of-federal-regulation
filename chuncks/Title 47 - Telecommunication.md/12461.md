######## Consolidated license,Spectrum blocks A through V.

(d)-(1)Incumbent licensees operating at multiple sites may, after grant of EA licenses has been completed, exchange multiple site licenses for a single license, authorizing operations throughout the contiguous and overlapping 40 dBµV/m field strength contours of the multiple sites. Incumbents exercising this license exchange option must submit specific information on Form 601 for each of their external base sites after the close of the 800 MHz SMR auction. The incumbent's geographic license area is defined by the contiguous and overlapping 22 dBµV/m contours of its constructed and operational external base stations and interior sites that are constructed within the construction period applicable to the incumbent. Once the geographic license is issued, facilities that are added within an incumbent's existing footprint and that are not subject to prior approval by the Commission will not be subject to construction requirements.
