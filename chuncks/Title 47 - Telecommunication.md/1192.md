######## Financial hardship.

(k)(1) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a review by the Commission of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in demonstrated financial hardship.

(2) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current amount of garnishment results in demonstrated financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation. The Commission will consider any information submitted; however, demonstrated financial hardship must be based on financial records that include Federal and state tax returns, affidavits executed under the pain and penalty of perjury, and, in the case of business-related financial hardship (e.g., the debtor is a partner or member of a business-agency relationship) full financial statements (audited and/or submitted under oath) in accordance with procedures and standards established by the Commission.

(3) If a financial hardship is found, the Commission will downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the Commission, the amount garnisheed to reflect the debtor's financial condition. The Commission will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.
