####### Authorized bandwidth.

(9)Provided that the ACP requirements of this section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth that does not exceed the channel size.

(f) For operations in the 746-758 MHz, 775-788 MHz, and 805-806 MHz bands, emissions in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited to -70 dBW/MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and -80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that is representative of the type that will be used with the equipment in normal operation.

(g) For operations in the 600 MHz band and the 698-746 MHz band, the power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kilohertz or greater. However, in the 100 kilohertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to a licensee's frequency block, a resolution bandwidth of at least 30 kHz may be employed.
