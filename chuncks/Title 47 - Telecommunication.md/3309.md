(b) The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio transmitter,, the intentional radiator, contained in the UWB device. Other aspects of the operation of a UWB device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a UWB device that contains digital circuitry not directly associated with the operation of the transmitter also is subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B of this part. Similarly, an associated receiver that operates (tunes) within the frequency range 30 MHz to 960 MHz is subject to the requirements in subpart B of this part.
