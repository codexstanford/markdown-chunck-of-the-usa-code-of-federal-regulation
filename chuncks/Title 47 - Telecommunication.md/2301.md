####### ยง 2.1072 Limitation on Supplier's Declaration of Conformity.

(a) Supplier's Declaration of Conformity signifies that the responsible party, as defined in ยง 2.909, has determined that the equipment has been shown to comply with the applicable technical standards and other applicable requirements if no unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and operated.

(b) Supplier's Declaration of Conformity by the responsible party, as defined in ยง 2.909, is effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the Commission.

(c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use or make reference to Supplier's Declaration of Conformity in a deceptive or misleading manner or convey the impression that such Supplier's Declaration of Conformity reflects more than a determination by the manufacturer, importer, integrator, or responsible party, as defined in ยง 2.909, that the device or product has been shown to be capable of complying with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.
