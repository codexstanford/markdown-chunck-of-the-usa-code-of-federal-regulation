####### Adjacent channel interference.

(1)In the presence of a lower adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual carrier in frequency and 10 dB below the desired visual carrier in amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier which is 10 dB below the visual carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be performed for input signal levels of 0 dBmV and + 15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.
