(i) The coordinates of the proposed repeater to an accuracy of no less than +/-1 second latitude and longitude;

(ii) The proposed operating power(s), frequency band(s), and emission(s);

(iii) The antenna center height above ground and ground elevation above mean sea level, both to an accuracy of no less than +/-1 meter;

(iv) The antenna gain pattern(s) in the azimuth and elevation planes that include the peak of the main beam; and

(v) The antenna downtilt angle(s).

(3) An SDARS licensee operating terrestrial repeaters must maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of its terrestrial repeaters operating above 2 watts average EIRP, including the information set forth in ยง 25.263(c)(2), which shall be available upon request by the Commission.
