###### Cost-Sharing Policies Governing Broadband Radio Service Relocation From the 2150-2160/62 MHz Band
####### ยง 27.1184 Triggering a reimbursement obligation.

(a) The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine when an AWS entity has triggered a cost-sharing obligation and therefore must pay an AWS relocator of a BRS system in accordance with the formula detailed in ยง 27.1180:

(1) All or part of the relocated BRS system was initially co-channel with the licensed AWS band(s) of the AWS entity;

(2) An AWS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the BRS incumbent; and

(3) The other AWS entity has turned on or is preparing to turn on a fixed base station at commercial power and the incumbent BRS system would have been within the line of sight of the AWS entity's fixed base station, defined as follows.

(i) For a BRS system using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band exclusively to provide one-way transmissions to subscribers, the clearinghouse will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's geographic service area (GSA), based on the following criteria: use of 9.1 meters (30 feet) for the receiving antenna height, use of the actual transmitting antenna height and terrain elevation, and assumption of 4/3 Earth radius propagation conditions. Terrain elevation data must be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 3-second database. All coordinates used in carrying out the required analysis shall be based upon use of NAD-83.
