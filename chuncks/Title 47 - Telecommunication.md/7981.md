####### Rural OCN.

The term "rural OCN" means an operating company number that uniquely identifies an incumbent LEC (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter) that is a rural telephone company (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter). The term "nonrural OCN" means an operating company number that uniquely identifies an incumbent LEC (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter) that is not a rural telephone company (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter). We direct NECA to update the lists of rural and nonrural OCNs annually and provide them to the Wireline Competition Bureau in time for the Bureau to publish the lists no later than November 15. These lists will be the definitive lists of rural OCNs and nonrural OCNs for purposes of this subpart for the following calendar year.
