####### Automatic Transmitter Power Control (ATPC).

ATPC is a feature of a digital microwave radio system that adjusts the transmitter output power. ATPC allows the transmitter to operate at less than maximum power for most of the time. In a radio employing ATPC, the transmit power is reduced during normal operation conditions. When the receiver detects a reduction in signal level, a control signal is sent to the far end transmitter, instructing it to increase the power output to compensate for the signal reduction. The power output is limited to the licensed (maximum) transmit power. Guidelines for use of ATPC are set forth in the TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, "Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems (TSB 10)."
