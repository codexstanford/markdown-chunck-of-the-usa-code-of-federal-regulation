## Chapter I - Federal Communications Commission
### Subchapter C - Broadcast Radio Services
#### PART 73 - RADIO BROADCAST SERVICES
##### Subpart H - Rules Applicable to All Broadcast Stations
###### § 73.3572 Processing of TV broadcast, Class A TV broadcast, low power TV, TV translators, and TV booster applications.

(a) Applications for TV stations are divided into two groups:

(1) In the first group are applications for new stations or major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change for TV broadcast stations authorized under this part is any change in frequency or community of license which is in accord with a present allotment contained in the Table of Allotments (§ 73.622(j)). Other requests for change in frequency or community of license for TV broadcast stations must first be submitted in the form of a petition for rulemaking to amend the Table of Allotments.

(2) In the case of Class A TV stations authorized under subpart J of this part and low power TV, TV translator, and TV booster stations authorized under part 74 of this chapter, a major change is any change in:

(i) Frequency (output channel), except a change in offset carrier frequency; or

(ii) Transmitting antenna location where the protected contour resulting from the change is not predicted to overlap any portion of the protected contour based on the station's authorized facilities.

(3) Other changes will be considered minor including changes made to implement a channel sharing arrangement provided they comply with the other provisions of this section and provided, until October 1, 2000, proposed changes to the facilities of Class A TV, low power TV, TV translator and TV booster stations, other than a change in frequency, will be considered minor only if the change(s) will not increase the signal range of the Class A TV, low power TV or TV booster in any horizontal direction.

(4) The following provisions apply to displaced Class A TV, low power TV, TV translator and TV booster stations:

(i) In the case of an authorized low power TV, TV translator or TV booster which is predicted to cause or receive interference to or from an authorized TV broadcast station pursuant to § 74.705 of this chapter or interference with broadcast or other services under § 74.703 or § 74.709 of this chapter, an application for a change in output channel, together with technical modifications which are necessary to avoid interference (including a change in antenna location of less than 16.1km), will not be considered as an application for a major change in those facilities.

(ii) Provided further, that a low power TV or TV translator or TV booster station which is causing or receiving interference or is predicted to cause or receive interference to or from an authorized DTV station pursuant to § 74.706 of this chapter, or which is located within the distances specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section to the coordinates of co-channel DTV authorizations (or allotment table coordinates if there are no authorized facilities at different coordinates), may at any time file a displacement relief application for a change in output channel, together with any technical modifications which are necessary to avoid interference or continue serving the station's protected service area. Such an application will not be considered as an application for a major change in those facilities. Where such an application is mutually exclusive with applications for new low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster stations, or with other nondisplacement relief applications for facilities modifications of Class A TV, low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster stations, priority will be afforded to the displacement application(s) to the exclusion of other applications.

(iii) A Class A TV station which is causing or receiving interference or is predicted to cause or receive interference to or from an authorized TV broadcast station pursuant to § 73.6011 or § 73.613; a DTV station or allotment pursuant to § 73.6013 or § 73.623, or which is located within the distances specified below in paragraph (iv) of this section to the coordinates of co-channel DTV authorizations (or allotment table coordinates if there are no authorized facilities at different coordinates); or other service that protects and/or is protected by Class A TV stations, may at any time file a displacement relief application for a change in channel, together with technical modifications that are necessary to avoid interference or continue serving the station's protected service area, provided the station's protected contour resulting from a relocation of the transmitting antenna is predicted to overlap some portion of the protected contour based on its authorized facilities. A Class A TV station displacement relief applications will be considered major change applications, and will be placed on public notice for a period of not less than 30 days to permit the filing of petitions to deny. However, these applications will not be subject to the filing of competing applications. Where a Class A displacement relief application becomes mutually exclusive with applications for new low power TV, TV translator or TV booster stations, or with other non-displacement relief applications for facilities modifications of Class A TV, low power TV, TV translator or TV booster stations, priority will be afforded to the Class A TV displacement relief application(s) to the exclusion of other applications. Mutually exclusive displacement relief applications of Class A TV, low power TV, TV translators or TV booster stations filed on the same day will be subject to competitive bidding procedures if the mutual exclusivity is not resolved by an engineering solution.

(iv)(A) The geographic separations to co-channel DTV facilities or allotment reference coordinates, as applicable, within which to qualify for displacement relief are the following:
