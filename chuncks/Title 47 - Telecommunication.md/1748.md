(ii) You can refer to the International and Satellite Services fee guide located ator

(iii) You can run a draft electronic submission of payment online form through ICFS, in association with a filed application, and the system will automatically enter your required fee on the form.

(2)(i) A complete FCC electronic submission of payment online form must accompany all fee payments. You must provide the FRN for both the applicant and the payer. You also must include your submission ID number on the electronic submission of payment online form in the box labeled "FCC Code 2." In addition, for applications for transfer of control or assignment of license, call signs involved in the transaction must be entered into the "FCC Code 1" box on the FCC electronic submission of payment online form. (This may require the use of multiple rows on the electronic submission of payment online form for a single application where more than one call sign is involved.)
