####### Mobile and portable stations.,except that

(3)(i) For mobile and portable stations transmitting in the 2305-2315 MHz band or the 2350-2360 MHz band, the average EIRP must not exceed 50 milliwatts within any 1 megahertz of authorized bandwidth,for mobile and portable stations compliant with 3GPP LTE standards or another advanced mobile broadband protocol that avoids concentrating energy at the edge of the operating band the average EIRP must not exceed 250 milliwatts within any 5 megahertz of authorized bandwidth but may exceed 50 milliwatts within any 1 megahertz of authorized bandwidth. For mobile and portable stations using time division duplexing (TDD) technology, the duty cycle must not exceed 38 percent in the 2305-2315 MHz and 2350-2360 MHz bands. Mobile and portable stations using FDD technology are restricted to transmitting in the 2305-2315 MHz band. Power averaging shall not include intervals in which the transmitter is off.

(ii) Mobile and portable stations are not permitted to transmit in the 2315-2320 MHz and 2345-2350 MHz bands.
