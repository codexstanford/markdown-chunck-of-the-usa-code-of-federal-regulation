###### ยง 64.633 Procedures for resolution of unauthorized changes in default provider.
####### Proof of verification.

(d)Not more than 30 days after notification of the complaint or other notification, the alleged unauthorized default provider shall provide to the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau a copy of any valid proof of verification of the default provider change. This proof of verification must clearly demonstrate a valid authorized default provider change, as that term is defined in ยง ยง 64.631 through 64.632 of this part. The Commission will determine whether an unauthorized change, as defined by ยง 64.601(a) of this part, has occurred using such proof and any evidence supplied by the iTRS user or other iTRS providers. Failure by the allegedly unauthorized provider to respond or provide proof of verification will be presumed to be sufficient evidence of a violation.
