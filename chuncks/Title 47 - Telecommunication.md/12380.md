(a) Encryption is permitted on all but the two nationwide Interoperability calling channels. Radios employing encryption must have a readily accessible switch or other readily accessible control that permits the radio user to disable encryption.

(b) If encryption is employed, then transmitters manufactured after August 11, 2014 must use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specified in ANSI/TIA-102.AAAD-A. Until 2030, manufacturers may also include the Digital Encryption Standard (DES) or Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), in addition to but not in place of AES, for compatibility with legacy radios that lack AES capability.
