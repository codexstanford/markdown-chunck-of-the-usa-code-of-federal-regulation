##### Appendix B to Part 1 - Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas

WHEREAS, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (the Council) and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO) executed this Nationwide Collocation Programmatic Agreement on March 16, 2001 in accordance with 36 CFR Section 800.14(b) to address the Section 106 review process as it applies to the collocation of antennas; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC encourages collocation of antennas where technically and economically feasible, in order to reduce the need for new tower construction; and in its Wireless Infrastructure Report and Order, WT Docket No. 13-238, et al, released October 21, 2014, adopted initial measures to update and tailor the manner in which it evaluates the impact of proposed deployments on the environment and historic properties and committed to expeditiously conclude a program alternative to implement additional improvements in the Section 106 review process for small deployments that, because of their characteristics, are likely to have minimal and not adverse effects on historic properties; and,

WHEREAS, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Title VI-Public Safety Communications and Electromagnetic Spectrum Auctions, Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Public Law 112-96, 126 Stat. 156 (2012)) was adopted with the goal of advancing wireless broadband services, and the amended provisions in this Agreement further that goal; and,

WHEREAS, advances in wireless technologies since 2001 have produced systems that use smaller antennas and compact radio equipment, including those used in Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) and small cell systems, which are a fraction of the size of traditional cell tower deployments and can be installed on utility poles, buildings, and other existing structures as collocations; and,

WHEREAS, the parties to this Collocation Agreement have taken into account new technologies involving use of small antennas that may often be collocated on utility poles, buildings, and other existing structures and increase the likelihood that such collocations will have minimal and not adverse effects on historic properties, and rapid deployment of such infrastructure may help meet the surging demand for wireless services, expand broadband access, support innovation and wireless opportunity, and enhance public safety-all to the benefit of consumers and the communities in which they live; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO have agreed that these new measures should be incorporated into this Collocation Agreement to better manage the Section 106 consultation process and streamline reviews for collocation of antennas; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO have crafted these new measures with the goal of promoting technological neutrality, with the goal of obviating the need for further amendments in the future as technologies evolve; and,

WHEREAS, notwithstanding the intent to draft provisions in a manner that obviates the need for future amendments, in light of the public benefits associated with rapid deployment of the facilities required to provide broadband wireless services, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO have agreed that changes in technology and other factors relating to the placement and operation of wireless antennas and associated equipment may necessitate further amendments to this Collocation Agreement in the future; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO have agreed that with respect to the amendments involving the use of small antennas, such amendments affect only the FCC's review process under Section 106 of the NHPA, and will not limit State and local governments' authority to enforce their own historic preservation requirements consistent with Section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act and Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO acknowledge that federally recognized Indian tribes (Indian tribes), Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs), SHPO/THPOs, local governments, and members of the public make important contributions to the Section 106 review process, in accordance with Section 800.2(c) & (d) of the Council's rules, and note that the procedures for appropriate public notification and participation in connection with the Section 106 process are set forth the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement Regarding the Section 106 National Historic Preservation Act Review Process (NPA); and,

WHEREAS, the parties hereto agree that the amended procedures described in this amendment to the Collocation Agreement are, with regard to collocations as defined herein, a proper substitute for the FCC's compliance with the Council's rules, in accordance and consistent with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulations found at 36 CFR part 800; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC sought comment from Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian Organizations regarding the terms of this amendment to the Collocation Agreement by letters dated April 17, 2015, July 28, 2015, and May 12, 2016, as well as during face-to-face meetings and conference calls, including during the Section 106 Summit in conjunction with the 2015 annual conference of the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (NATHPO); and,

WHEREAS, the terms of this amendment to the Collocation Agreement do not apply on "tribal lands" as defined under Section 800.16(x) of the Council's regulations, 36 CFR 800.16(x) ("Tribal lands means all lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian communities."); and,

WHEREAS, the terms of this amendment to the Collocation Agreement do not preclude Indian tribes or NHOs from consulting directly with the FCC or its licensees, tower companies and applicants for antenna licenses when collocation activities off tribal lands may affect historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Indian tribes or NHOs; and,

WHEREAS, the execution and implementation of this amendment to the Collocation Agreement will not preclude members of the public from filing complaints with the FCC or the Council regarding adverse effects on historic properties from any existing tower or any activity covered under the terms of this Collocation Agreement;

NOW THEREFORE, in accordance with Stipulation XI (as renumbered by this amendment), the FCC, the Council, and NCSHPO agree to amend the Collocation Agreement to read as follows:

WHEREAS, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) establishes rules and procedures for the licensing of wireless communications facilities in the United States and its Possessions and Territories; and,

WHEREAS, the FCC has largely deregulated the review of applications for the construction of individual wireless communications facilities and, under this framework, applicants are required to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) in cases where the applicant determines that the proposed facility falls within one of certain environmental categories described in the FCC's rules (47 CFR 1.1307), including situations which may affect historical sites listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places ("National Register"); and,
