####### et seq.,

(a) In order to carry out its responsibilities under the Communications Act and the various treaties and international regulations, and in order to promote efficient use of the radio spectrum, the Commission has developed technical standards for radio frequency equipment. The technical standards applicable to individual types of equipment are found in that part of the rules governing the service wherein the equipment is to be operated. In addition to the technical standards, the rules governing the service may require that such equipment receive an equipment authorization from the Commission as a prerequisite for marketing and importing this equipment into the U.S.A. The marketing rules, ยง 2.801were adopted pursuant to the authority in section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 302).

(b) The rules in this subpart set out the conditions under which radio frequency devices as defined in ยง 2.801 that are capable of causing harmful interference to radio communications may be imported into the U.S.A.

(c) Nothing in this section prevents importers from shipping goods into foreign trade zones or Customs bonded warehouses, such as is the prescribed procedure under ยง 2.1204(a)(5). Radio frequency devices capable of causing harmful interference, however, cannot be withdrawn from these areas except in accordance with the provisions of this section.
