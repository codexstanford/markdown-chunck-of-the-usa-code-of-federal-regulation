####### Satellite Space Station Applications (other than DBS and DARS) and Applications for Earth Stations to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to Provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States.

We consider a Satellite Space Station application (other than DBS and DARS) and an Application for an Earth Station to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to Provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States officially filed the moment you file them through ICFS. The system tracks the date and time of filing (to the millisecond). For purposes of the queue discussed in ยง 25.158 of this chapter, we will base the order of the applications in the queue on the date and time the applications are filed, rather than the "Official Filing Date" as defined here.
