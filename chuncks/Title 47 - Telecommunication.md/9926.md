####### Required information.

(6)(i) An application in paragraph (g)(2) of this section must include the following information:

(A) The station serving as the host, if applicable;

(B) The technical facilities of the host station, if applicable;

(C) The DMA of the originating broadcaster's facility and the DMA of the host station, if applicable; and

(D) Any other information deemed necessary by the Commission to process the application.

(ii) If an application in paragraph (g)(2) of this section includes a request to air an ATSC 1.0 signal on the facilities of a host station, the LPTV or TV translator broadcaster must also indicate on the application:

(A) The predicted population within the protected contour served by the station's original ATSC 1.0 signal;

(B) The predicted population within the protected contour served by the station's original ATSC 1.0 signal that will lose the station's ATSC 1.0 service as a result of the simulcasting arrangement, including identifying areas of service loss by providing a contour overlap map; and

(C) Whether the ATSC 1.0 simulcast signal aired on the host station will serve at least 95 percent of the population in paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(A) of this section.

(iii) If an application in paragraph (g)(2) of this section includes a request to air an ATSC 1.0 signal on the facilities of a host station and does not meet the 95 percent standard in paragraph (g)(6)(ii) of this section, the application must contain, in addition to the information in paragraphs (g)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, the following information:

(A) Whether there is another possible host station(s) in the market that would result in less service loss to existing viewers and, if so, why the Next Gen TV broadcaster chose to partner with a host station creating a larger service loss;

(B) What steps, if any, the station plans to take to minimize the impact of the service loss (e.g., providing ATSC 3.0 dongles, set-top boxes, or gateway devices to viewers in the loss area); and

(C) The public interest benefits of the simulcasting arrangement and a showing of why the benefit(s) of granting the application would outweigh the harm(s). These applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
