####### ยง 90.671 Field strength limits.

The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the border of the MTA service area for MTA licensees shall not exceed 40 dBuV/m unless all bordering MTA licensees agree to a higher field strength. MTA licensees are also required to coordinate their frequency usage with so-channel adjacent MTA licensees and all other affected parties. To the extent that a single entity obtains licenses for adjacent MTAs on the same channel block, it will not be required to coordinate its operations in this manner. In the event that this standard conflicts with the MTA licensee's obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbent licensees under ยง 90.621(b), the requirements of ยง 90.621(b) shall prevail.
