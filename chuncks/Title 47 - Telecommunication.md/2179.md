(e)If a frequency or frequency band has been allocated to a radiocommunication service in the non-Federal Table, then a cross reference may be added to the pertinent FCC Rule part (column 6 of ยง 2.106) or, where greater specificity would be useful, to the pertinent subpart. For example, the band 849-851 MHz is allocated to the aeronautical mobile service for non-Federal use, rules for the use of the 849-851 MHz band have been added to part 22-Public Mobile Services (47 CFR part 22), and a cross reference, Public Mobile (22), has been added in column 6 of ยง 2.106. The exact use that can be made of any given frequency or frequency band (channeling plans, allowable emissions, etc.) is given in the FCC Rule part(s) so indicated. The FCC Rule parts in this column are not allocations, may apply to only a portion of a band, and are provided for informational purposes only. This column also may contain explanatory notes for informational purposes only.
