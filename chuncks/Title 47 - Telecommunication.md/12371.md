####### Swept power measurement.

(3)Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and average, sample, or RMS detection. Set the reference level of the spectrum analyzer to the RMS value of the transmitter power. Sweep above and below the carrier frequency to the limits defined in the tables. Calculate ACP by substracting the reference power level measured in (b)(1) from the measurements made in this step. The absolute value of the calculated ACP must be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the ACP given in the table for each condition above.
