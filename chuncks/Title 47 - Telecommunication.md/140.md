###### Public Information and Inspection of Records
####### ยง 0.457 Records not routinely available for public inspection.
######## Interagency and intra-agency memoranda or letters, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5).

(e)Interagency and intra-agency memoranda or letters and the work papers of members of the Commission or its staff will not be made available for public inspection, except in accordance with the procedures set forth in ยง 0.461. Normally such papers are privileged and not available to private parties through the discovery process, because their disclosure would tend to restrain the commitment of ideas to writing, would tend to inhibit communication among Government personnel, and would, in some cases, involve premature disclosure of their contents. The Commission will not use this deliberative process exemption to withhold records created 25 years or more before the date on which the request was received.
