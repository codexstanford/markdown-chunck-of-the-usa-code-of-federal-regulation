####### Applying the criteria.

(c)(1) Guidelines for applying the interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part are specified in the Telecommunications Industry Association's Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB 10, "Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems" (TSB 10). Other procedures that follow generally acceptable good engineering practices are also acceptable to the Commission.

(2) If TSB 10 guidelines cannot be used, the following interference protection criteria may be used by calculating the ratio in dB between the desired (carrier signal) and the undesired (interfering) signal (C/I ratio) appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation (victim receiver). Except as provided in ยง 101.147 where the applicant's proposed facilities are of a type not included in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section or where the development of the carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio is not covered by generally acceptable procedures, or where the applicant does not wish to develop the carrier-to-interference ratio, the applicant must, in the absence of criteria or a developed C/I ratio, employ the following C/I protection ratios:
