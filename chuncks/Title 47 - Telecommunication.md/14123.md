(2) Income received by FirstNet other than from fees authorized under 47 U.S.C. 1428(a) is not directly subject to NTIA review. However, NTIA will consider such non-fee-based income as part of its determination of whether such income, when combined in aggregate with the fees authorized under 47 U.S.C. 1428(a), will be sufficient to recoup FirstNet's total expenses, but not exceed the amount necessary to carry out its statutory powers, duties, and responsibilities under 47 U.S.C. 1401for the fiscal year involved.
