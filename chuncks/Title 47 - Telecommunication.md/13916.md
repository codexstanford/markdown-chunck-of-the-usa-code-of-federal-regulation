c.The NSEP TSP System may apply, at the discretion of and upon special arrangements by the entities involved, to authorize priority treatment to the following telecommunication services:

(1) Government or non-common carrier services which are not connected to common carrier provided services assigned a priority level pursuant to paragraph 13 of this directive.

(2) Portions of U.S. international services which are provided by foreign correspondents. (Subject to pertinent law, including references 4a, 4c, and 4f, U.S. telecommunication service vendors are encouraged to ensure that relevant operating arrangements are consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the NSEP TSP System. If such agreements do not exist, U.S. telecommunication service vendors should handle service provisioning and/or restoration in accordance with any system acceptable to their foreign correspondents which allows provisioning and restoration in the manner most comparable to the procedures established in this directive.) In addition, the U.S. government, acting through the Department of State, may enter into the following types of agreements to ensure that priority provisioning and restoration procedures consistent with those governing domestic services within the NSEP TSP System are in place: (a) Bilateral agreements for reciprocal priority treatment for critical foreign government telecommunication services in the U.S., and (b) multilateral agreements within such international telecommunication organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Long Lines Agency or Civil Communications Planning Committee, which have or are conducive to having a provisioning and restoration priority system.
