####### Areas.

(c)To further assist in the international allocation of the radio spectrum, the ITU has established five special geographical areas and they are defined as follows:

(1) The term "African Broadcasting Area" means:

(i) African countries, parts of countries, territories and groups of territories situated between the parallels 40&#xB0; South and 30&#xB0; North;

(ii) Islands in the Indian Ocean west of meridian 60&#xB0; East of Greenwich, situated between the parallel 40&#xB0; South and the great circle arc joining the points 45&#xB0; East, 11&#xB0;30&#x2032; North and 60&#xB0; East, 15&#xB0; North; and

(iii) Islands in the Atlantic Ocean east of line B, situated between the parallels 40&#xB0; South and 30&#xB0; North.

(2) The "European Broadcasting Area" is bounded on the west by the western boundary of Region 1, on the east by the meridian 40&#xB0; East of Greenwich and on the south by the parallel 30&#xB0; North so as to include the northern part of Saudi Arabia and that part of those countries bordering the Mediterranean within these limits. In addition, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and those parts of the territories of Iraq, Jordan, Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey and Ukraine lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.

(3) The "European Maritime Area" is bounded to the north by a line extending along parallel 72&#xB0; North from its intersection with meridian 55&#xB0; East of Greenwich to its intersection with meridian 5&#xB0; West, then along meridian 5&#xB0; West to its intersection with parallel 67&#xB0; North, thence along parallel 67&#xB0; North to its intersection with meridian 32&#xB0; West; to the west by a line extending along meridian 32&#xB0; West to its intersection with parallel 30&#xB0; North; to the south by a line extending along parallel 30&#xB0; North to its intersection with meridian 43&#xB0; East; to the east by a line extending along meridian 43&#xB0; East to its intersection with parallel 60&#xB0; North, thence along parallel 60&#xB0; North to its intersection with meridian 55&#xB0; East and thence along meridian 55&#xB0; East to its intersection with parallel 72&#xB0; North.

(4) The "Tropical Zone" (see Figure 1 of this section) is defined as:

(i) The whole of that area in Region 2 between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.

(ii) The whole of that area in Regions 1 and 3 contained between the parallels 30&#xB0; North and 35&#xB0; South with the addition of:

(A) The area contained between the meridians 40&#xB0; East and 80&#xB0; East of Greenwich and the parallels 30&#xB0; North and 40&#xB0; North; and

(B) That part of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya north of parallel 30&#xB0; North.
