####### Storage.

(3)Decoders must provide the means to:

(i) Record and store, either internally or externally, at least two minutes of audio or text messages. A decoder manufactured without an internal means to record and store audio or text must be equipped with a means (such as an audio or digital jack connection) to couple to an external recording and storing device.

(ii) Store at least ten preselected event and originator header codes, in addition to the seven mandatory event/originator codes for tests and national activations, and store any preselected location codes for comparison with incoming header codes. A non-preselected header code that is manually transmitted must be stored for comparison with later incoming header codes. The header codes of the last ten received valid messages which still have valid time periods must be stored for comparison with the incoming valid header codes for later messages. These last received header codes will be deleted from storage as their valid time periods expire.
