(4) The address to which that message is sent or directed does not include a reference to a domain name that has been posted on the FCC's wireless domain names list for a period of at least 30 days before that message was initiated, provided that the person or entity does not knowingly initiate a mobile service commercial message.

(b) Any person or entity initiating any mobile service commercial message must:

(1) Cease sending further messages within ten (10) days after receiving such a request by a subscriber;

(2) Include a functioning return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism that is clearly and conspicuously displayed for the purpose of receiving requests to cease the initiating of mobile service commercial messages and/or commercial electronic mail messages, and that does not require the subscriber to view or hear further commercial content other than institutional identification;
