####### § 0.470 Assessment of fees.
######## Commercial use requesters.

(a)(1)(i) When the Commission receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating the records sought pursuant to § 0.466 and § 0.467.

(ii) Commercial use requesters shall not be assessed search fees if the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under § 0.461(g), except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

(iii) Commercial requesters may still be assessed search fees when the Commission fails to comply with the time limits under § 0.461(g) if the Commission determines that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, so long as the Commission has provided a timely written notice to the requester and has discussed with the requester (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request. Additionally, if a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with a time limit under § 0.461(g) will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
