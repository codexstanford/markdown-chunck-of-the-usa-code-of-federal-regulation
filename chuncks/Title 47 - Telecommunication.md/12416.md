######## Contour matrix.

(3)Interference contour levels for the contour analysis described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section are determined using Table 4 or Table 5 to this paragraph (d)(3). Table 4 is used to determine the interference contour F(50,10) level of a fixed station operating on a 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth channel while Table 5 is used to determine the interference contour F(50,10) level of a fixed station operating on a 25 kilohertz bandwidth channel. The dBu level of the interference contour is determined by cross-referencing the modulation type of the station operating on the 25 kilohertz bandwidth channel with the modulation type of the station operating on the 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth channel.
