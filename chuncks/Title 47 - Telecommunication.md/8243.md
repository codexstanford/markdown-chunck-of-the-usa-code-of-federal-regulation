###### ยง 64.6306 Exemption.
####### Exemption for non-IP networks.

(b)A voice service provider may seek an exemption from the requirement to upgrade its network to allow for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of SIP calls and fully implement the STIR/SHAKEN framework as required by ยง 64.6301 throughout its network by June 30, 2021, and from associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements, by certifying on or before December 1, 2020, that, for those portions of its network that do not allow for the transmission of SIP calls, it:

(1) Has taken reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework by either:

(i) Upgrading its entire network to allow for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of SIP calls, and fully implementing the STIR/SHAKEN framework as required in ยง 64.6301 throughout its network; or

(ii) Maintaining and being ready to provide the Commission on request with documented proof that it is participating, either on its own or through a representative, including third party representatives, as a member of a working group, industry standards group, or consortium that is working to develop a non-internet Protocol caller identification authentication solution, or actively testing such a solution; and

(2) Will be capable of fully implementing an effective call authentication framework not later than June 30, 2021, because it reasonably foresees that it will have completed all necessary network upgrades to its network infrastructure to enable the authentication and verification of caller identification information for all non-internet Protocol calls originating or terminating on its network as provided by a standardized caller identification authentication framework for non-internet Protocol networks by June 30, 2021.
