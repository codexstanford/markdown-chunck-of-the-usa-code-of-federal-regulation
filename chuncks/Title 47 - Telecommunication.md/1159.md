######## Petition for hearing.

(a)(1) An employee may request a hearing by filing a written petition with the Managing Director of the Commission, or designated official stating why the employee believes the determination of the Commission concerning the existence or the amount of the debt is in error.

(2) The employee's petition must be executed under penalty of perjury by the employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, which the employee believes support his or her position.

(3) The petition must be filed no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date that the notification was hand delivered or the date of delivery by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(4) If a petition is received after the fifteenth (15) calendar day deadline referred to paragraph (a) (3) of this section, the Commission will nevertheless accept the petition if the employee can show, in writing, that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).

(5) If a petition is not filed within the time limit specified in paragraph (a) (3) of this section, and is not accepted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the employee's right to hearing will be considered waived, and salary offset will be implemented by the Commission.
