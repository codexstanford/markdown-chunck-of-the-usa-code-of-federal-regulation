(b)-(1)The rules and regulations of the Commission are contained in chapter I of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Chapter I is divided into the following four subchapters, which may be purchased separately: Subchapter A-General; Subchapter B-Common Carrier Services; Subchapter C-Broadcast Radio Services; and Subchapter D-Private Radio Services. Most persons will find that they need subchapter A, containing the general rules, and one of the other volumes, depending upon their area of interest. These four volumes are revised annually to reflect changes in the rules. See §§ 0.406, 0.412, and 0.415. The Code of Federal Regulations is fully indexed and contains numerous finding aids. See 1 CFR appendix C.
