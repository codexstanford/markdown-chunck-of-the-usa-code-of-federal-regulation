####### Rules of distribution.

(c)(1) When the filing window(s) described in paragraph (b) of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for support submitted by applicants during the filing window. If total demand exceeds the total support available, the Administrator shall allocate funds to these requests for support, beginning with the most economically disadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by the schools and libraries category one discount matrix in ยง 54.505(c) adjusted to provide a five percent increase for rural schools and libraries, as shown in the following matrix.

(2) Schools and libraries eligible for a 95 percent discount shall receive first priority for the funds. The Administrator shall next allocate funds toward the requests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for an 90 percent discount, then for a 85 percent discount, and shall continue committing funds in the same manner to the applicants at each descending discount level until there are no funds remaining. If the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all of the funding requests within a particular discount level, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that discount level using the percentage of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program.
