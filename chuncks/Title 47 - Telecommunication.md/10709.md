####### Basis for Commission determination as to encoding terms for an undefined business model.

(v)In a permit-but-disclose proceeding, unless otherwise specified by the Commission, to determine whether encoding terms as noticed may be applied to an undefined business model, the covered entity shall have the burden of proof to establish that application of the encoding terms in the undefined business model is in the public interest. In making any such determination, the Commission shall take into account the following factors:

(A) Whether the benefit to consumers of the new service, including but not limited to earlier release windows, more favorable terms, innovation or original programming, outweighs the limitation on the consumers' control over the new service;

(B) Ways in which the new service differs from services offered by any covered entity prior to December 31, 2002;
