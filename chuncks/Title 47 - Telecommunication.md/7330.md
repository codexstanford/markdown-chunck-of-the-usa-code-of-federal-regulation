###### ยง 63.03 Streamlining procedures for domestic transfer of control applications.
####### Presumptive streamlined categories.

(b)(1) The streamlined procedures provided in this rule shall be presumed to apply to all transfer of control applications in which:

(i) Both applicants are non-facilities-based carriers;

(ii) The transferee is not a telecommunications provider; or

(iii) The proposed transaction involves only the transfer of the local exchange assets of an incumbent LEC by means other than an acquisition of corporate control.

(2) Where a proposed transaction would result in a transferee having a market share in the interstate, interexchange market of less than 10 percent, and the transferee would provide competitive telephone exchange services or exchange access services (if at all) exclusively in geographic areas served by a dominant local exchange carrier that is not a party to the transaction, the streamlined procedures provided in this rule shall be presumed to apply to transfer of control applications in which:

(i) Neither of the applicants is dominant with respect to any service;

(ii) The applicants are a dominant carrier and a non-dominant carrier that provides services exclusively outside the geographic area where the dominant carrier is dominant; or

(iii) The applicants are incumbent independent local exchange carriers (as defined in ยง 64.1902 of this chapter) that have, in combination, fewer than two (2) percent of the nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide, and no overlapping or adjacent service areas.

(3) For purposes of (b)(1) and (2) of this paragraph, the terms "applicant," "carrier," "party," and "transferee" (and their plural forms) include any affiliates of such entities within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
