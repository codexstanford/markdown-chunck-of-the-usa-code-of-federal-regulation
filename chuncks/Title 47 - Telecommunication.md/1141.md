(iii) When the Commission previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (31 CFR 901.2), the Commission need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.

(5) Before the Commission refers delinquent debts to the Treasury, the Office of Managing Director must certify, in a form acceptable to the Treasury, that:

(i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

(ii) The Commission has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and its regulations.

(6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Treasury shall exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when requested in writing by the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency. Also, the Treasury may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the head of the payment certifying or authorizing agency.
