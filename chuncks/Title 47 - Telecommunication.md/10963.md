(2)The area surrounding the active character display. In Text Mode, the box is the entire screen area defined for display, whether or not displayable characters appear.

The box (or boxes, in the case of a multiple-element caption) includes all the cells of the displayed characters, the non-transparent spaces between them, and one cell at the beginning and end of each row within a caption element in those decoders that use a solid space to improve legibility.
