(c)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that would result in an average distance to the service contour of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the service contour is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures specified in ยง 22.567 for the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water.
