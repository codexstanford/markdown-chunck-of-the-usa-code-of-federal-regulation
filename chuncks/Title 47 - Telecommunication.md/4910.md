(ii)Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth as shown in the tables above. Measure the ACP in dBm. These measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate the coupled power by subtracting the measurements made in this step from the reference power measured in the previous step. The absolute ACP values must be less than the values given in the table for each condition above.
