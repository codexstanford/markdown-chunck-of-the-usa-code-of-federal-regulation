######## Global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS).

An International Maritime Organization (IMO) worldwide coordinated maritime distress system designed to provide the rapid transfer of distress messages from vessels in distress to units best suited for giving or coordinating assistance. The system includes standardized equipment and operational procedures, unique identifers for each station, and the integrated use of frequency bands and radio systems to ensure the transmission and reception of distress and safety calls and messages at short, medium and long ranges.
