######## Report and Order on Further Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,

(ii) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the clearinghouse will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub using the method prescribed in "Methods for Predicting Interference from Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for Supplying Data on Response Station Systems. MM Docket 97-217," in Amendment of 47 CFR parts 1, 21 and 74 to Enable Multipoint Distribution Service and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licensees to Engage in Fixed Two-Way Transmissions, MM Docket No. 97-217,15 FCC Rcd 14566 at 14610, Appendix D.

(b) If the application of the trigger test described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, indicates that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and notify the subsequent AWS entity of the total amount of its reimbursement obligation.

(c) Once a reimbursement obligation is triggered, the AWS entity may not avoid paying its cost-sharing obligation by deconstructing or modifying its facilities.
