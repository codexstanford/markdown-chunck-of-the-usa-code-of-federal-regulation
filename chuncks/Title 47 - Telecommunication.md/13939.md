#### Appendix to Part 216 - NCS Directives
##### Assignment and Approval of Priority Levels and Priority Actions.

a.

(1) Priority level assignments or other priority actions will be based upon section 16, NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and Priority Levels, of this directive. A priority level assignment or other priority action made by the Manager, NCS, will serve as the recommendation of the Director, OSTP (on behalf of the EOP) to the FCC. If the Director, OSTP does not approve the priority level assignment or other priority action made by the Manager, NCS, then the Director can direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level assignment or other priority action.

(2) Until the President's war emergency powers under Section 706 of the Communications Act are invoked, priority level assignments or other priority actions must be approved by the FCC. (If the FCC does not approve the priority level assignment or other priority action, then it can direct the Manager, NCS, to revise or revoke the priority level assignment or other priority action.) However, the FCC has instructed service vendors to implement any priority level assignments or other priority actions that are pending FCC approval.

(3) After invocation of the President's war emergency powers, the requirement for FCC approval of priority level assignments or other priority actions may be superseded by other procedures issued by the Director, OSTP.
