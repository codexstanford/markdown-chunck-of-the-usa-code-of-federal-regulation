###### ยง 87.151 Special requirements for differential GPS receivers.

(a) The receiver shall achieve a message failure rate less than or equal to one failed message per 1000 full-length (222 bytes) application data messages, while operating over a range from -87 dBm to -1 dBm, provided that the variation in the average received signal power between successive bursts in a given time slot shall not exceed 40 dB. Failed messages include those lost by the VHF data receiver system or which do not pass the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) after application of the forward error correction (FEC).

(b) The aircraft receiving antenna can be horizontally or vertically polarized. Due to the difference in the signal strength of horizontally and vertically polarized components of the broadcast signal, the total aircraft implementation loss is limited to 15 dB for horizontally polarized receiving antennas and 11 dB for vertically polarized receiving antennas.
