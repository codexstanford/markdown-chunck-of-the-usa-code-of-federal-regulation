####### Resolution of objections to copper retirement notices.

(f)An objection to a notice that an incumbent LEC intends to retire copper, as defined in ยง 51.325(a)(3) shall be deemed denied 90 days after the date on which the Commission releases public notice of the incumbent LEC filing, unless the Commission rules otherwise within that time. Until the Commission has either ruled on an objection or the 90-day period for the Commission's consideration has expired, an incumbent LEC may not retire those copper facilities at issue.
