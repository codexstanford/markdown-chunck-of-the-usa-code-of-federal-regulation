######## General notification procedures.

(1)Notifications of spectrum manager leasing arrangements will be processed pursuant to the general notification procedures set forth in this paragraph (e)(1) unless they are submitted and qualify for the immediate processing procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(i) To be accepted under these general notification procedures, the notification must be sufficiently complete and contain all information and certifications requested on the applicable form, FCC Form 608, including any information and certifications (including those of the spectrum lessee relating to eligibility, basic qualifications, and foreign ownership) required by the rules in this chapter and any rules pertaining to the specific service for which the notification is filed. No application fees are required for the filing of a spectrum manager leasing notification.

(ii) The licensee must submit such notification at least 21 days in advance of commencing operations unless the arrangement is for a term of one year or less, in which case the licensee must provide notification to the Commission at least ten (10) days in advance of operation. If the licensee and spectrum lessee thereafter seek to extend this leasing arrangement for an additional term beyond the initial term, the licensee must provide the Commission with notification of the new spectrum leasing arrangement at least 21 days in advance of operation under the extended term.
