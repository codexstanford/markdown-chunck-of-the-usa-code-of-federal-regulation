###### § 51.914 Additional provisions applicable to Access Stimulation traffic.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if a local exchange carrier is engaged in Access Stimulation, as defined in § 61.3(bbb) of this chapter, it shall, within 45 days of commencing Access Stimulation, or within 45 days of November 27, 2019, whichever is later:

(1) Not bill any Interexchange Carrier for terminating switched access tandem switching or terminating switched access transport charges for any traffic between such local exchange carrier's terminating end office or equivalent and the associated access tandem switch; and

(2) Shall designate, if needed, the Intermediate Access Provider(s) that will provide terminating switched access tandem switching and terminating switched access tandem transport services to the local exchange carrier engaged in access stimulation and that the local exchange carrier shall assume financial responsibility for any applicable Intermediate Access Provider's charges for such services for any traffic between such local exchange carrier's terminating end office or equivalent and the associated access tandem switch.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if a local exchange carrier is engaged in Access Stimulation, as defined in § 61.3(bbb) of this chapter, it shall, within 45 days of commencing Access Stimulation, or within 45 days of November 27, 2019, whichever is later, notify in writing the Commission, all Intermediate Access Providers that it subtends, and Interexchange Carriers with which it does business of the following:

(1) That it is a local exchange carrier engaged in Access Stimulation; and

(2) That it shall designate the Intermediate Access Provider(s) that will provide the terminating switched access tandem switching and terminating switched access tandem transport services to the local exchange carrier engaged in access stimulation and that it shall pay for those services as of that date.

(c) In the event that an Intermediate Access Provider receives notice under paragraph (b) of this section that it has been designated to provide terminating switched access tandem switching or terminating switched access tandem transport services to a local exchange carrier engaged in Access Stimulation and that local exchange carrier shall pay for such terminating access service from such Intermediate Access Provider, the Intermediate Access Provider shall not bill Interexchange Carriers for terminating switched access tandem switching or terminating switched access tandem transport service for traffic bound for such local exchange carrier but, instead, shall bill such local exchange carrier for such services.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any local exchange carrier that is not itself engaged in Access Stimulation, as that term is defined in § 61.3(bbb) of this chapter, but serves as an Intermediate Access Provider with respect to traffic bound for a local exchange carrier engaged in Access Stimulation, shall not itself be deemed a local exchange carrier engaged in Access Stimulation or be affected by paragraphs (a) and (b).

(e) Upon terminating its engagement in Access Stimulation, as defined in § 61.3(bbb) of this chapter, the local exchange carrier engaged in Access Stimulation shall provide concurrent, written notification to the Commission and any affected Intermediate Access Provider(s) and Interexchange Carrier(s) of such fact.
