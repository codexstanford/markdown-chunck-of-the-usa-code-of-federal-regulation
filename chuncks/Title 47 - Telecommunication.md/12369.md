####### Setting reference level.

(1)Set transmitter to maximum output power. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter set the measurement bandwidth to 6.25 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero and adjust the center frequency of the instrument to the assigned center frequency to measure the average power level of the transmitter. Record this power level in dBm as the "reference power level."
