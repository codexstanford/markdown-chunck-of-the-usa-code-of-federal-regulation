####### Eligibility verification processes.

(a)To verify whether a household is an eligible household, a participating provider shall-

(1) Use the National Verifier; or

(2) Rely upon an alternative verification process of the participating provider, if-

(i) The participating provider submits information as required by the Commission regarding the alternative verification process prior to seeking reimbursement; and

(ii) Not later than 7 days after receiving the information required under paragraph(a)(2)(i) of this section, the Wireline Competition Bureau-

(A) Determines that the alternative verification process will be sufficient to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse; and

(B) Notifies the participating provider of the determination under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

(3) Rely on a school to verify the eligibility of a household based on the participation of the household in the free and reduced price lunch program or the school breakfast program as described in ยง 54.1800(j)(3). The participating provider shall retain documentation demonstrating the school verifying eligibility, the program(s) that the school participates in, the qualifying household, and the program(s) the household participates in.

(4) Check its own electronic systems, whether such systems are maintained by the participating provider or a third party, to confirm that the household is not already receiving another affordable connectivity benefit from that participating provider.

(5) Collect and retain documentation establishing at least one member of the household is enrolled in a school or school district that participates in the National School Lunch Program's Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) (42 U.S.C. 1759a) if enrolling households based on CEP eligibility.
