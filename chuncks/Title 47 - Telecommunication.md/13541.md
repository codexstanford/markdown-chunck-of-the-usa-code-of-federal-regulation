###### ยง 101.105 Interference protection criteria.

(a) The interference protection criteria for fixed stations subject to this part are as follows:

(1) To long-haul analog systems, employing frequency modulated radio and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, the allowable interference level per exposure:

(i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not exceed 5 pwpO (Picowatts of absolute noise power psophometrically weighted (pwpO), appearing in an equivalent voice band channel of 300-3400 Hz); or

(ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 pwpO.

(2) To short-haul analog systems employing frequency modulated radio and frequency division multiplexing to provide multiple voice channels, the allowable interference level per exposure:

(i) Due to co-channel sideband-to-sideband interference must not exceed 25 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 250 pwpO per exposure; or

(ii) Due to co-channel carrier-beat interference must not exceed 50 pwpO except in the 952-960 MHz band interference into single link fixed relay and control stations must not exceed 1000 pwpO per exposure.

(3) FM-TV. In analog systems employing frequency modulated radio that is modulated by a standard, television (visual) signal, the allowable interference level per exposure may not exceed the levels which would apply to long-haul or short-haul FM-FDM systems, as outlined in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, having a 600-1200 voice channel capacity.

(4) 12.2-12.7 GHz band. (i) To accommodate co-primary NGSO FSS earth stations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, the PFD of an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed -135 dBW/min any 4 kHz band at a reference point at the surface of the earth at a distance greater than 3 kilometers from the MVDDS transmitting antenna.

(ii) To accommodate co-primary Direct Broadcast Satellite Service earth stations, an MVDDS transmitting system must not exceed the EPFD levels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section at any DBS subscriber location in accordance with the procedures listed in ยง 101.1440 of this part.

(A) Definition of equivalent power flux density: The equivalent power flux density (EPFD) is the power flux density produced at a direct broadcast service (DBS) receive earth station, taking into account shielding effects and the off-axis discrimination of the receiving antenna assumed to be pointing at the appropriate DBS satellite(s) from the transmitting antenna of a multichannel video distribution and data service (MVDDS) transmit station. The EPFD in dBW/min the reference bandwidth is calculated using the following formula:

(B) Regional equivalent power flux density levels:
