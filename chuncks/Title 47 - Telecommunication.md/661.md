######## Taxpayer Identification Number (TINs).

(h)Wireless applicants and licensees, including all attributable owners of auctionable licenses as defined by ยง 1.2112 of this part, are required to provide their Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6109) to the Commission, pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). Under the DCIA, the FCC may use an applicant or licensee's TIN for purposes of collecting and reporting to the Department of the Treasury any delinquent amounts arising out of such person's relationship with the Government. The Commission will not publicly disclose applicant or licensee TINs unless authorized by law, but will assign a "public identification number" to each applicant or licensee registering a TIN. This public identification number will be used for agency purposes other than debt collection.
