(2) In the 17,700 to 19,700 MHz band, transmitter output power shall not exceed 10 watts.

(b) In no event shall the average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to an isotropic radiator, exceed the values specified in the following table. In cases of harmful interference, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, order a change in the equivalent isotropically radiated power of this station.

(c) The EIRP of transmitters that use Automatic Transmitter Power Control (ATPC) shall not exceed the EIRP specified on the station authorization. The EIRP of non-ATPC transmitters shall be maintained as near as practicable to the EIRP specified on the station authorization.
