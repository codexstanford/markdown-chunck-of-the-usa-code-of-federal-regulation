####### ยง 1150.36 Exempt construction of connecting track.
######## Scope.,See

(a)This class exemption applies to proceedings involving the construction and operation of connecting lines of railroad within existing rail rights-of-way, or on land owned by connecting railroads, under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (a), (b), and (c). (See the reference to connecting track in 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(1).) This class exemption is designed to expedite and facilitate connecting track construction while ensuring full and timely environmental review. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) has found that its prior review of connecting track construction and operation is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; that continued regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power; and that the construction of connecting track would be of limited scope.49 U.S.C. 10502. To use this class exemption, a pre-filing notice, environmental report, historic report, and notice of exemption must be filed that complies with the procedures in ยง 1150.36 (b) and (c), and the Board's environmental rules, codified at 49 CFR part 1105.
