In an interim final rule published on September 3, 1999 (64 FR 48510), FHWA qualified its previous expansive interpretation of "compensation" as applied to vanpools. In short, FHWA took the position that Congress never intended for commuter vanpools arranged and operated by groups of people trying to get to work, not attempting to start a commuter transportation side business, to be subject to federal regulation. Accordingly, FHWA affirmatively stated that the Agency had no intention to regulate vanpools created for the convenience of the passengers, not for financial gain in running a commuter transportation business. Because FHWA considered the term "for compensation" to be equivalent to "for hire", the Agency recognized that payments passengers made into a vanpool to cover vehicle expenses could be considered compensation subjecting the vanpool operator to government regulation. FHWA ultimately decided that as long as funds contributed to the vanpool were not used as a source of income or to grow a commuter transportation business, then the operation should not be regulated as a for-hire motor carrier of passengers.
