#### Appendix E to Part 37 - Reasonable Modification Requests
##### 26. Five-Minute Warning or Notification of Arrival Calls.,e.g.,

A passenger's request for a telephone call 5 minutes (or another reasonable interval) in advance or at time of vehicle arrival generally should be granted. As a matter of courtesy, such calls are encouraged as a good customer service model and can prevent "no shows." Oftentimes, these calls can be generated through an automated system. In those situations where automated systems are not available and paratransit drivers continue to rely on hand-held communication devices (cellular telephones) drivers should comply with any State or Federal laws related to distracted driving.
