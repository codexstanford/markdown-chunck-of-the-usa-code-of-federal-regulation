######## Emergency discharge control

means the ability to stop a cargo tank unloading operation in the event of an unintentional release. Emergency discharge control can utilize passive or off-truck remote means to stop the unloading operation. A passive means of emergency discharge control automatically shuts off the flow of product without the need for human intervention within 20 seconds of an unintentional release caused by a complete separation of the liquid delivery hose. An off-truck remote means of emergency discharge control permits a qualified person attending the unloading operation to close the cargo tank's internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment at a distance from the cargo tank motor vehicle.
