##### Appendix A to Part 228 - Requirements of the Hours of Service Act: Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

First enacted in 1907, the Hours of Service Act was substantially revised in 1969 by Public Law 91-169. Further amendments were enacted as part of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1976, Public Law 94-348 and by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, Public Law 100-342. The purpose of the law is "to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of employees * * *." This appendix is designed to explain the effect of the law in commonly-encountered situations.

The Act governs the maximum work hours of employees engaged in one or more of the basic categories of covered service treated below. If an individual performs more than one kind of covered service during a tour of duty, then the most restrictive of the applicable limitations control.

The act applies to any railroad, as that term is defined in 45 U.S.C. 431(e). It governs the carrier's operations over its own railroad and all lines of road which it uses.
