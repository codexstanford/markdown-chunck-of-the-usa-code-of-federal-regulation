######### Verifying covered segments.,see,see,see

(2)An operator must verify the risk factors used in identifying pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area on at least an annual basis not to exceed 15 months (Appendix C of this part provides additional guidance on factors that can influence whether a pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area). If a change in circumstance indicates that the prior consideration of a risk factor is no longer valid or that an operator should consider new risk factors, an operator must perform a new integrity analysis and evaluation to establish the endpoints of any previously identified covered segments. The integrity analysis and evaluation must include consideration of the results of any baseline and periodic integrity assessments (paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section), information analyses (paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions about remediation and preventive and mitigative actions (paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section). An operator must complete the first annual verification under this paragraph no later than July 1, 2021.
