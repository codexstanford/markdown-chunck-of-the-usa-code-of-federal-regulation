##### ยง 23.51 How are a recipient's overall goals expressed and calculated?
###### Alternative methods.

(5)(i) You may use other methods to determine a base figure for your overall goal. Any methodology you choose must be based on demonstrable evidence of local market conditions and be designed to ultimately attain a goal that is rationally related to the relative availability of ACDBEs in your market area.

(ii) In the case of a car rental goal, where it appears that all or most of the goal is likely to be met through the purchases by car rental companies of vehicles or other goods or services from ACDBEs, one permissible alternative is to structure the goal entirely in terms of purchases of goods and services. In this case, you would calculate your car rental overall goal by dividing the estimated dollar value of such purchases from ACDBEs by the total estimated dollar value of all purchases to be made by car rental companies.
