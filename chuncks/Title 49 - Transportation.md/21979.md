####### Procedure.

S6.1.4Apply heat to the flask so that within 10 +/-2 minutes the fluid is refluxing in excess of 1 drop per second. The reflux rate shall not exceed 5 drops per second at any time. Immediately adjust the heating rate to obtain an equilibrium reflux rate of 1 to 2 drops per second over the next 5 +/-2 minutes. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, taking four temperature readings at 30-second intervals. Record the average of these as the observed ERBP. If no reflux is evident when the fluid temperature reaches 260 &#xB0;C (500 &#xB0;F), discontinue heating and report ERBP as in excess of 260 &#xB0;C (500 &#xB0;F).
