######## Pressure testing.

(v)Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, each container must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath. The temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F) or 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F). If the contents are sensitive to heat, or if the container is made of plastic material which softens at this test temperature, the temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) and 30 &#xB0;C (86 &#xB0;F) but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container is permitted except that a plastic container may be deformed through softening provided that it does not leak.
