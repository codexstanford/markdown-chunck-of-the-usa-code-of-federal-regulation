######### i.e.,

(xv) Results of examinations of exposed portions of buried pipelines (pipe and pipe coating condition, see ยง 195.569);

(xvi) Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and other cracking (pipe body or weld) excavations and findings, including in-situ non-destructive examinations and analysis results for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipeline;

(xvii) Aerial photography;

(xviii) Location of foreign line crossings;

(xix) Pipe exposures resulting from repairs and encroachments;

(xx) Seismicity of the area; and

(xxi) Other pertinent information derived from operations and maintenance activities and any additional tests, inspections, surveys, patrols, or monitoring required under this part.

(2) Consider information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and development or planned development along the pipeline;

(3) Consider how a potential failure would affect high consequence areas, such as location of a water intake.
