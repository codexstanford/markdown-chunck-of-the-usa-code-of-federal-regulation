### PART 24 - UNIFORM RELOCATION ASSISTANCE AND REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION FOR FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY-ASSISTED PROGRAMS
#### Appendix A to Part 24 - Additional Information
##### Section 24.103 Criteria for Appraisals.

The term "requirements" is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with The Appraisal Foundation's Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) "standards." Although this section discusses appraisal requirements, the definition of "appraisal" itself at ยง 24.2(a)(3) includes appraisal performance requirements that are an inherent part of this section.

The term "Federal and federally-assisted program or project" is used to better identify the type of appraisal practices that are to be referenced and to differentiate them from the private sector, especially mortgage lending, appraisal practice.
