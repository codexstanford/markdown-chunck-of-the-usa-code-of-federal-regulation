####### High temperature resistance test.

S10.1(a) Measure the initial outside diameter of the hose.

(b) Subject the hose to an internal vacuum of 26 inches of Hg at an ambient temperature of 257 degrees Fahrenheit (125 degrees Celsius) for a period of 96 hours. Remove the hose to room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

(c) Within 5 minutes of completion of the conditioning in S10.1(b), measure the outside diameter at the point of greatest collapse and calculate the percentage collapse based on the initial outside diameter.

(d) Cool the hose at room temperature for 5 hours. Bend the hose around a mandrel with a diameter equal to five times the initial outside diameter of the hose. Examine the exterior of the hose for cracks, charring, or disintegration visible without magnification. Remove the hose from the mandrel.

(e) Fill the hose assembly with water, allowing all gases to escape. Apply water pressure in the hose of 175 psi within 10 seconds. Maintain an internal hydrostatic pressure of 175 psi for one minute and examine the hose for visible leakage.
