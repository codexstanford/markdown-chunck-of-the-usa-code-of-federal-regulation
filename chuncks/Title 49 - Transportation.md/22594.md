S5.3

S5.3.1 The color of the red reflex reflective material on the warning device shall have the following characteristics, both before and after the warning device has been conditioned in accordance with S6.1, when the source of illumination is a lamp with a tungsten filament operating at 2856&#xB0; Kelvin color temperature. Expressed in terms of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 standard colorimetric observer system (CIE chromaticity diagram, Figure 4), the chromaticity coordinates of the red reflex reflective material shall lie within the region bounded by the spectrum locus and the lines on the diagram defined by the following equations:

S5.3.2 The color of the orange fluorescent material on the warning device shall have the following characteristics, both before and after the warning device has been conditioned in accordance with S6.1, when the source of illumination is a 150-watt high pressure xenon compact arc lamp. Expressed in terms of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 standard colorimetric observer system, the chromaticity coordinates of the orange fluorescent material shall lie within the region bounded by the spectrum locus and the lines on the diagram defined by the following equations:

The 150-watt high pressure xenon compact arc lamp shall illuminate the sample using the unmodified spectrum at an angle of incidence of 45&#xB0; and an angle of observation of 90&#xB0;. If dual purpose material is being tested, it shall be illuminated by a 150-watt high pressure xenon compact arc lamp, whose light is diffused by an integrating sphere.
