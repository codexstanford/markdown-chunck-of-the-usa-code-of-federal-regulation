####### Guidance:

This scenario describes for-hire interstate transportation by a CMV. The faith-based organization's bus is a CMV, as defined in §§ 390.5T and 390.5, operating for-hire in interstate commerce, and the organization is a motor carrier subject to all applicable FMCSRs, including parts 350 through 399. In addition, the faith-based organization is operating a passenger-carrying CMV, as defined in § 383.5 because it is designed to transport 16 or more passengers; the driver of the organization's bus must therefore hold a valid CDL with a Passenger endorsement and comply with the drug and alcohol testing regulations in part 382.

The organization must register by following the procedures in 49 CFR part 365 subpart A regarding operating authority registration and part 390 subpart E regarding USDOT number registration, because it is receiving compensation for transportation in interstate commerce. No exemptions apply to this operation.

The faith-based organization is operating a passenger vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 16, for-hire in interstate commerce and is therefore required under §§ 387.33T and 387.33 to maintain $5 million of financial responsibility.
