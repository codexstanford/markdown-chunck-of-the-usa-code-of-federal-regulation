S13.3When the vehicle is in its "as delivered" condition, measure the angle between the left side door sill and the horizontal. Mark where the angle is taken on the door sill. The "as delivered" condition is the vehicle as received at the test site, with 100 percent of all fluid capacities and all tires inflated to the manufacturer's specifications as listed on the vehicle's tire placard. When the vehicle is in its "fully loaded" condition, measure the angle between the left side door sill and the horizontal, at the same place the "as delivered" angle was measured. The "fully loaded" condition is the test vehicle loaded in accordance with S8.1.1(a) or (b) of Standard No. 208, as applicable. The load placed in the cargo area shall be centered over the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle. The pretest door sill angle, when the vehicle is on the sled, (measured at the same location as the as delivered and fully loaded condition) shall be equal to or between the as delivered and fully loaded door sill angle measurements.
