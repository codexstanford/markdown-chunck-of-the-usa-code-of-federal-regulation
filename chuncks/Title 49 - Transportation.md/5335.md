###### Subpart C - General Handling and Loading Requirements
####### ยง 174.55 General requirements.

(a) Each package containing a hazardous material being transported by rail in a freight container or transport vehicle must be loaded so that it cannot fall or slide and must be safeguarded in such a manner that other freight cannot fall onto or slide into it under conditions normally incident to transportation. When this protection cannot be provided by using other freight, it must be provided by blocking and bracing. For examples of blocking and bracing in freight containers and transport vehicles, see the Intermodal Loading Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and Containers (see table 1 to ยง 171.7 of this subchapter).

(b) Each package containing a hazardous material bearing package orientation markings prescribed in ยง 172.312 of this subchapter must be loaded within a transport vehicle or freight container to remain in the correct position indicated by those markings during transportation.

(c) The doors of a freight container or transport vehicle may not be used to secure a load that includes a package containing a hazardous material unless the doors meet the design strength requirements of Specification M-930 (for freight containers) and M-931 (for trailers) in the AAR's specification for "Specially Equipped Freight Car and Intermodal Equipment" (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter) and the load is also within the limits of the design strength requirements for the doors.
