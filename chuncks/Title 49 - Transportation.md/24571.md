####### Target reorientation-90 degree rotation.

S5.2.5.2If after following the procedure given in S5.2.5.1 there are less than four targets in a side daylight opening, repeat the procedure in 5.2 through 5.2.5.1.2, with a modification to S5.2 as follows. Reorient the target by rotating it 90 degrees about the y axis of the target such that the target positive z axis is aligned within +/-1 degree of the vehicle longitudinal axis, pointing in the direction of the vehicle positive x axis (see Figures 5a and 5b) (figures provided for illustration purposes). If after performing the procedure in this section, the remaining targets exceed the number of targets determined with the original orientation of the target, the reoriented targets represent the final target locations for the side daylight opening.
