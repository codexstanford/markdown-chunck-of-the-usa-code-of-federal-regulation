Thus, FRA considers a "willful" violation to be one that is an intentional, voluntary act committed either with knowledge of the relevant law or reckless disregard for whether the act violated the requirements of the law. Accordingly, neither a showing of evil purpose (as is sometimes required in certain criminal cases) nor actual knowledge of the law is necessary to prove a willful violation, but a level of culpability higher than negligence must be demonstrated.v.469 U.S. 111 (1985);v.809 F.2d 161 (1st Cir. 1987); andv.744 F.2d 170 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
