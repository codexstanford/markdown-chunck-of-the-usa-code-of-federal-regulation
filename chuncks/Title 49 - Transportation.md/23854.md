####### Tilt-lock adjustment.

(f)This test shall be made on buckles or other manual adjusting devices having tilt-lock adjustment normally used to adjust the size of the assembly. Three buckles or devices shall be tested. The base of the adjustment mechanism and the anchor end of the webbing shall be oriented in planes normal to each other. The webbing shall be drawn through the adjustment mechanism in a direction to increase belt length at a rate of 508 mm +/-50 mm per minute while the plane of the base is slowly rotated in a direction to lock the webbing. Rotation shall be stopped when the webbing locks, but the pull on the webbing shall be continued until there is a resistance of at least 89 N. The locking angle between the anchor end of the webbing and the base of the adjustment mechanism shall be measured to the nearest degree. The webbing shall be precycled 10 times prior to measurement.
