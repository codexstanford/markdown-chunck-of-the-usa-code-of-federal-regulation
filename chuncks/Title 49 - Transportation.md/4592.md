######## Assignment of packing groups.

(b)(1) The packing group of a Division 5.1 material which is a solid shall be assigned using the following criteria:

(i) Packing Group I, for any material which, in either concentration tested:

(A) If test O.1 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.1), the mean burning time is less than the mean burning time of a 3:2 potassium bromate/cellulose mixture; or

(B) If test O.3 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.3), the mean burning rate is greater than the mean burning rate of a 3:1 calcium peroxide/cellulose mixture.

(ii) Packing Group II, for any material which, in either concentration tested:

(A) If test O.1 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.1), the mean burning time is less than the mean burning time of a 2:3 potassium bromate/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Group I are not met; or

(B) If test O.3 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.3), the mean burning rate is greater than the mean burning rate of a 1:1 calcium peroxide/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Group I are not met.

(iii) Packing Group III for any material which, in either concentration tested:

(A) If test O.1 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.1), the mean burning time is less than the mean burning time of a 3:7 potassium bromate/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Groups I and II are not met; or

(B) If test O.3 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.3), the mean burning rate is greater than the mean burning rate of a 1:2 calcium peroxide/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Groups I and II are not met.

(iv) The materials is not classified as a Division 5.1 material if, in either concentration tested:

(A) If test O.1 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.1), the sample tested does not ignite and exhibit burn, or exhibits a mean burning time of greater than or equal to the mean burning time of a 3:7 potassium bromate/cellulose mixture.

(B) If test O.3 is used (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, sub-section 34.4.3), the sample tested does not ignite and exhibit burn, or exhibits a mean burning rate less than or equal to the mean burning rate of a 1:2 calcium peroxide/cellulose mixture.

(2) The packing group of a Division 5.1 material which is a liquid shall be assigned using the following criteria:

(i) Packing Group I for:

(A) Any material which spontaneously ignites when mixed with cellulose in a 1:1 ratio; or

(B) Any material which exhibits a mean pressure rise time less than the pressure rise time of a 1:1 perchloric acid (50 percent)/cellulose mixture.

(ii) Packing Group II, any material which exhibits a mean pressure rise time less than or equal to the pressure rise time of a 1:1 aqueous sodium chlorate solution (40 percent)/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Group I are not met.

(iii) Packing Group III, any material which exhibits a mean pressure rise time less than or equal to the pressure rise time of a 1:1 nitric acid (65 percent)/cellulose mixture and the criteria for Packing Group I and II are not met.
