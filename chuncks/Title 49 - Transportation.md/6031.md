######## Alternative volumetric expansion testing.

(3)As an alternative to the testing prescribed in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, every cylinder may be volumetrically expansion tested by the water jacket or direct expansion test method. The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

(i) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of at least two (2) times its service pressure.

(ii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

(iii) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
