####### Lateral neck flexion qualification test.

(2)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure W4 in appendix A to this subpart, shall rotate in the direction of pre-impact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 76.5 degrees and 87.5 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within these angles, the peak moment measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S8) shall have a value between 25.3 N-m and 32.0 N-m.

(ii) The decaying headform rotation vs. time curve shall cross the zero angle with respect to its initial position at time of impact relative to the pendulum centerline between 61 to 71 ms after the time the peak rotation value is reached.

(iii) All instrumentation data channels are defined to be zero when the longitudinal centerline of the neck and pendulum are parallel.

(iv) The headform rotation shall be calculated by the following formula with the integration beginning at time zero:

(v) (Headform Angular Rate)is the angular rate about the y-axis in deg/sec measured on the headform (drawing 020-9050, sheet 1), and (Pendulum Angular Rate)is the angular rate about the y-axis in deg/sec measured on the pendulum interface plate (drawing 020-9051).
