###### Cost of labor.

(a)This includes the amount paid for labor expended by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or making soundings for tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; and cost of labor expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary use in construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks provided for the protection of traffic during the progress of addition and betterment work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting company's expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation and holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and retirement plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office expenses and traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when borne by the carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the labor, as shall also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability insurance premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned to construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental expenses while thus engaged shall be included in the cost of the work. No charge shall be made against road and equipment accounts for the pay of officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in connection with extensions, additions, or betterments, although traveling and incidental expenses incurred by such officers and employees solely on account of such work shall be included in the account to which the cost of the work is chargeable.
