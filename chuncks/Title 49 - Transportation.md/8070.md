####### § 192.620 Alternative maximum allowable operating pressure for certain steel pipelines.
######## How does an operator calculate the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure?

(a)An operator calculates the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure by using different factors in the same formulas used for calculating maximum allowable operating pressure under § 192.619(a) as follows:

(1) In determining the alternative design pressure under § 192.105, use a design factor determined in accordance with § 192.111(b), (c), or (d) or, if none of these paragraphs apply, in accordance with the following table:

(i) For facilities installed prior to December 22, 2008, for which § 192.111(b), (c), or (d) applies, use the following design factors as alternatives for the factors specified in those paragraphs: § 192.111(b)-0.67 or less; 192.111(c) and (d)-0.56 or less.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) The alternative maximum allowable operating pressure is the lower of the following:

(i) The design pressure of the weakest element in the pipeline segment, determined under subparts C and D of this part.

(ii) The pressure obtained by dividing the pressure to which the pipeline segment was tested after construction by a factor determined in the following table:
