S5.1 Demonstrate compliance with S4.2 of this standard in accordance with the test procedures specified in this standard, under the conditions of S6, using the equipment described in S7. In the impact test described by these procedures, target locations are identified (S5.2) and the zero displacement plane location is determined (S5.3). The glazing is pre-broken, fully retracted or removed prior to the impact test (S5.4). The countermeasure is deployed, if applicable, and an ejection impactor (see S7.1) strikes the countermeasure at the impact target locations, at the specified speeds and times (S5.5). The lateral displacement of the ejection impactor beyond the zero displacement plane is measured.
