####### Crush strength determination.

(e)Ignore all data prior to 6.4 mm (0.25 in) of crush and after 16.5 mm (0.65 in) of crush. Divide the remaining data into three sections or displacement intervals (n = 1, 2, 3) (see Figure 4) as follows. Interval one is from 6.4-9.7 mm (0.25-0.38 in) deflection, inclusive. Interval two is from 9.7-13.2 mm (0.38-0.52 in) deflection, exclusive. Interval three is from 13.2-16.5 mm (0.52-0.65 in) deflection, inclusive. Find the average for each section as follows:
