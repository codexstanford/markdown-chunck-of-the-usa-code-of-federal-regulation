S5.6.7.1

S5.6.7.1.1 According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Apply the parking brakes by making an application actuation of the parking brake control. Reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero, turn on the engine and allow it to idle, and allow the pressures in the vehicle's reservoirs to rise until they stabilize or until the compressor shut-off point is reached. At that time, make a release actuation of the parking brake control, and determine whether all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm failures or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.

S5.6.7.1.2 At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.1.1, and using the following procedure, determine the threshold maximum reservoir rate (in psi per minute). With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application.

S5.6.7.1.3 Using the following procedure, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage rate that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate determined in S5.6.7.1.2. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level that is to be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).
