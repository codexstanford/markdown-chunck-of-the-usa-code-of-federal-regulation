####### ยง 192.506 Transmission lines: Spike hydrostatic pressure test.
######## Spike test requirements.

(a)Whenever a segment of steel transmission pipeline that is operated at a hoop stress level of 30 percent or more of SMYS is spike tested under this part, the spike hydrostatic pressure test must be conducted in accordance with this section.

(1) The test must use water as the test medium.

(2) The baseline test pressure must be as specified in the applicable paragraphs of ยง 192.619(a)(2) or ยง 192.620(a)(2), whichever applies.

(3) The test must be conducted by maintaining a pressure at or above the baseline test pressure for at least 8 hours as specified in ยง 192.505.

(4) After the test pressure stabilizes at the baseline pressure and within the first 2 hours of the 8-hour test interval, the hydrostatic pressure must be raised (spiked) to a minimum of the lesser of 1.5 times MAOP or 100% SMYS. This spike hydrostatic pressure test must be held for at least 15 minutes after the spike test pressure stabilizes.
