######## General.

(a)Any respondent may request a formal hearing, pursuant to ยง 1503.413(c)(3) or ยง 1503.421(c)(3), to be conducted in accordance with the procedures in subpart G of this part. The filing of a request for a formal hearing does not guarantee a person an opportunity to appear before an ALJ in person, because the ALJ may issue an initial decision or dispositive order resolving the case prior to the commencement of the formal hearing.
