######## Fuse/Fuze.

Although these two words have a common origin (French fusee, fusil) and are sometimes considered to be different spellings, it is useful to maintain the convention that fuse refers to a cord-like igniting device, whereas fuze refers to a device used in ammunition which incorporates mechanical, electrical, chemical, or hydrostatic components to initiate a train by deflagration or detonation.
