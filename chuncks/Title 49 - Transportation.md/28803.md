######## Substitution of purchasers and disposition after sale.

(i)(1) Prior to the consummation of a purchase under this section, an offeror may substitute its corporate affiliate as the purchaser under an agreement, provided the Board has determined either:

(i) The original offeror has guaranteed the financial responsibility of its affiliate; or

(ii) The affiliate has demonstrated financial responsibility in its own right.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a purchaser under this section may not:

(i) Transfer the line or discontinue service over the line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the original sale under these provisions; or

(ii) Transfer the line, except to the carrier from whom the line was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation.

(3) Paragraph (i)(2) of this section does not preclude a purchaser under this section from transferring the line to a corporate affiliate following the consummation of the original sale. Prior Board approval of the affiliate's acquisition and operation, however, is required under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323. A corporate affiliate acquiring a line under this section is prohibited from discontinuing service over the line or transferring the line to a party that is not a corporate affiliate during the time periods prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
