(1) The person received an eviction notice prior to the initiation of negotiations and, as a result of that notice is later evicted; or

(2) The person is evicted after the initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement; and

(3) In either case the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make available the payments and other assistance set forth in this part.
