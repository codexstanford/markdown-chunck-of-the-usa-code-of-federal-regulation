######## Method of hammer testing.

(b)If staybolts are tested while the boiler contains water, the hydrostatic pressure must be not less than 95 percent of the MAWP. The steam locomotive owner and/or operator shall tap each bolt with a hammer and determine broken bolts from the sound or the vibration of the sheet.
