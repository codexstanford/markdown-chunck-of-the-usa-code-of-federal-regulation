####### ยง 178.68 Specification 4E welded aluminum cylinders.
######## Pressure test.

(1)All cylinders with a wall stress greater than 18,000 psig must be tested by water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

(i) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

(ii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

(iii) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 12 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
