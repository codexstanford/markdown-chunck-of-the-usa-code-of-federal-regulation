####### Zinc chloride resistance test.

S12.13(a) Utilize a cylinder having a radius equal to the supported bend radius in Table VIII for the size of tubing being tested. The cylinder is constructed of a non-reactive material or coated to prevent chemical reaction with zinc chloride. The length of the tubing sample is long enough so that its ends will not be submerged during the immersion in zinc chloride, or the ends of the tubing are plugged to keep the zinc chloride from entering the tubing.

(b) Bend the tubing 180 degrees around the cylinder and hold in place with a clamp or other suitable support constructed of non-reactive materials, applying only enough force on the tubing to hold it in position.

(c) Immerse the tubing and cylinder in a 50 percent zinc chloride aqueous solution at room temperature for 200 hours.

(d) Remove the tubing and cylinder from the solution. While still on the test cylinder, inspect the tubing under 7-power magnification for cracks.
