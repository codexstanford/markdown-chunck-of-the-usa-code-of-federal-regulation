######## Requalification marking method.

(c)The depth of requalification markings may not be greater than specified in the applicable specification. The markings must be made by stamping, engraving, scribing or applying a label embedded in epoxy that will remain legible and durable throughout the life of the cylinder, or by other methods that produce a legible, durable mark.

(1) A cylinder used as a fire extinguisher (see ยง 180.209(j)) may be marked by using a pressure sensitive label.

(2) For a DOT 3HT cylinder, when stamped, the test date and RIN must be applied by low-stress steel stamps to a depth no greater than that prescribed at the time of manufacture. Stamping on the sidewall is not authorized.

(3) For a composite cylinder, the requalification markings must be applied on a pressure sensitive label, securely affixed and overcoated with epoxy in a manner prescribed by the cylinder manufacturer, near the original manufacturer's label. Stamping of the composite surface is not authorized.
