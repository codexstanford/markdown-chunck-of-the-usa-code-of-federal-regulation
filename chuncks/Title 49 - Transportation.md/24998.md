####### Thoracic accelerometers.

(c)(1) Install accelerometers in the thoracic assembly as shown in drawing SA 106C 001, sheet 1, using suitable spacers and adaptors to affix them to the frontal surface of the spine assembly so that the sensitive axes of the three accelerometers intersect at a point in the midsagittal plane located 0.95 inches posterior of the spine mounting surface, and 0.55 inches below the horizontal centerline of the two upper accelerometer mount attachment hole centers.

(2) The sternum-thoracic assembly has three orthogonally mounted accelerometers aligned as follows:

(i) Align one accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane.

(ii) Align the second accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the attachment surface, and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane.

(iii) Align the third accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is perpendicular to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane.

(iv) The seismic mass center for any of these accelerometers may be at any distance up to 0.4 inches of the axial intersection point.
