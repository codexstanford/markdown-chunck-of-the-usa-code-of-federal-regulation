####### Centrifuge.

(b)A centrifuge capable of whirling two or more filled centrifuge tubes at a speed which can be controlled to give a relative centrifugal force (r.c.f.) between 600 and 700 at the tip of the tubes. The revolving head, trunnion rings, and trunnion cups, including the rubber cushion, shall withstand the maximum centrifugal force capable of being delivered by the power source. The trunnion cups and cushions shall firmly support the tubes when the centrifuge is in motion. Calculate the speed of the rotating head using this equation:

Table VI shows the relationship between diameter, swing, relative centrifugal force (r.c.f.), and revolutions per minute.
