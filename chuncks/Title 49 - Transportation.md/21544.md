S14.6.5.1.1 A sample headlamp, mounted on a headlamp test fixture, with all drain holes, breathing devices or other designed openings in their normal operating positions, is positioned within a cubical box, with inside measurements of 900 mm on each side or larger if required for adequate wall clearance (, a distance of at least 150 mm between the headlamp and any wall of the box).

S14.6.5.1.2 The box contains 4.5 kg of fine powdered cement which conforms to the ASTM C150-77 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5). Every 15 minutes, the cement is agitated by compressed air or fan blower(s) by projecting blasts of air for a two-second period in a downward direction so that the cement is diffused as uniformly as possible throughout the entire box.

S14.6.5.1.3 This test is continued for five hours after which the exterior surfaces of the headlamp are wiped clean.
