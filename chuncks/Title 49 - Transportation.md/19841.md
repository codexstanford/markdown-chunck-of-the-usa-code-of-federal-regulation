###### Credit calculation.

(D)Calculate credits as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Credits generated from engines and powertrains certified under this section may be used in other averaging sets as described in 40 CFR 1036.740(d).

(ii) There are no separate credit allowances for advanced technology vehicles in the Phase 2 program. Instead, vehicle families containing plug-in battery electric hybrids, all-electric, and fuel cell vehicles certifying to Phase 2 vocational and tractor standards may multiply credits by a multiplier of:

(A) 3.5 times for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;

(B) 4.5 times for all-electric vehicles; and

(C) 5.5 times for fuel cell vehicles.

(D) Incentivized credits for vehicles equipped with advanced technologies maintain the same credit flexibilities and restrictions as conventional credits specified in paragraph (a) of this section during the Phase 2 program.

(E) For vocational vehicles and tractors subject to Phase 2 standards, create separate vehicle families if there is a credit multiplier for advanced technology; group those vehicles together in a vehicle family if they use the same multiplier.

(F) For Phase 2 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and for fuel cells powered by any fuel other than hydrogen, calculate fuel consumption credits using an FEL based on equivalent emission measurements from powertrain testing. Phase 2 advanced-technology credits do not apply for hybrid vehicles that have no plug-in capability.
