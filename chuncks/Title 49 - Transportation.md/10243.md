(d) As a railroad, if you have a regulated employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (an employee drives a commercial motor vehicle and performs switchman duties for you), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is random tested.

Railroads may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.
