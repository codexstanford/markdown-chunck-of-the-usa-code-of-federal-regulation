###### ยง 571.106 Standard No. 106; Brake hoses.
####### Extended plug gauge.

S6.12.2(a) The test in 6.12.1 may be conducted with an extended plug gauge to enable testing of the entire brake hose from one end fitting, without cutting the brake hose. The extended plug gauge weight and spherical diameter specifications are as shown in Figure 4, but the handle portion of the gauge may be deleted and the gauge length may be greater than 3 inches.

(b) The required performance of the extended plug gauge in S6.12.1(e) is that after the plug gauge is released, the extended plug gauge shall fall under the force of gravity alone at an average rate of 1 inch per second until the spherical diameter of the extended gauge passes through all portions of the brake hose assembly containing hose. If the extended plug gauge does not pass through all portions of the brake hose assembly containing hose at an average rate of 1 inch per second, this constitutes failure of the constriction test.
