###### Sleeping Quarters.

Under the 1976 amendments to the Act it is unlawful for any common carrier to provide sleeping quarters for persons covered by the Hours of Service Act which do not afford such persons an opportunity for rest, free from interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad, in clean, safe, and sanitary quarters. Such sleeping quarters include crew quarters, camp or bunk cars, and trailers.

Sleeping quarters are not considered to be "free from interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad" if noise levels attributable to noise sources under the control of the railroad exceed an L(8) value of 55dB(A).
