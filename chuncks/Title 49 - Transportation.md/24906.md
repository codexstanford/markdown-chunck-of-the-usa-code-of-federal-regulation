####### Platform Lighting on public use lifts.

S4.1.5Public-use lifts must be provided with a light or set of lights that provide at least 22 lm/mor 22 Lux (2 lm/ftor 2 foot-candles) of illumination on all portions of the surface of the platform when the platform is at the vehicle floor level. Additionally, a light or set of lights must provide at least 11 lm/mor 11 Lux (1 lm/ftor 1 foot-candle) of illumination on all portions of the surface of the platform and all portions of the surface of the passenger-unloading ramp at ground level. In preparation for taking illumination measurements, operate the vehicle engine by idling or driving the test vehicle, with the vehicle's HVAC system turned off, for a minimum of 20 minutes, after which the engine is turned off. Illumination measurements are then recorded no later than 10 minutes after the time the engine is turned off, with the vehicle in a location where there is no apparent ambient light, and with the sensing element of the measuring device within 50 mm (2 inches) of the platform surface being measured.
