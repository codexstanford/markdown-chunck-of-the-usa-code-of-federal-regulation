####### Guidance:

This scenario describes for-hire interstate transportation of passengers by a CMV. The faith-based organization's bus is a CMV, as defined in § 390.5, operating for hire in interstate commerce, and the organization is a motor carrier subject to all applicable FMCSRs, including parts 350 through 399. In addition, the faith-based organization is operating a passenger-carrying CMV, as defined in § 383.5 because it is designed to transport 16 or more passengers; the driver of the faith-based organization's bus must hold a valid CDL with a Passenger endorsement and comply with the drug and alcohol testing regulations in part 382.

This is for hire interstate transportation of passengers by motor vehicle because the families pay the organization to use the bus and no exemptions apply to the operation. Thus, operating authority registration is required. The organization must register by following the procedures in 49 CFR part 365 subpart A regarding operating authority registration and part 390 subpart E regarding USDOT number registration.

Likewise, because the faith-based organization is operating a passenger vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 16, for-hire in interstate commerce, it is required under §§ 387.33T and 387.33 to maintain $5 million of financial responsibility.
