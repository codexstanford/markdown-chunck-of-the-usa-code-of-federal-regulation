##### Appendix E to Part 229 - Performance Criteria for Locomotive Crashworthiness

This appendix provides performance criteria for the crashworthiness evaluation of alternative locomotive designs, and design standards for wide-nosed locomotives and any for other locomotive, except monocoque/semi-monocoque design locomotives and narrow-nose design locomotives. Each of the following criteria describes a collision scenario and a given performance measure for protection provided to cab occupants, normally through structural design. Demonstration that these performance criteria have been satisfied may be accomplished through any of the methods described in ยง 229.205. This performance criteria is intended to prevent intrusion into the cab seating area occupied by crews. This excludes inner and outer vestibule areas.
