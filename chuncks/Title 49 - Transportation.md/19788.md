(5)Through model year 2026, trailer manufacturers may calculate a number of trailers that are exempt from the standards and certification requirements of this part. Calculate the number of exempt box vans in a given model year by multiplying the manufacturer's total U.S.-directed production volume of certified box vans by 0.20 and rounding to the nearest whole number; however, in no case may the number of exempted box vans be greater than 350 units in any given model year. Repeat this calculation to determine the number of non-box trailers, up to 250 annual units, that are exempt from standards and certification requirements. Perform the calculation based on the manufacturer's projected production volumes in the first year that standards apply; in later years, use actual production volumes from the preceding model year. Manufacturers include these calculated values of the production volumes of exempt trailers in their annual production report under ยง 535.8 and 40 CFR 1037.250.
