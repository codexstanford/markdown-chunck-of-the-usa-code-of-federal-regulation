####### Retraction.

S7.4.5When tested under the conditions of S8.1.2 and S8.1.3, with anthropomorphic dummies whose arms have been removed and which are positioned in accordance with S10 of this standard in the front outboard seating positions and restrained by the belt systems for those positions, the torso and lap belt webbing of any of those seat belt systems shall automatically retract to a stowed position either when the adjacent vehicle door is in the open position and the seat belt latchplate is released, or, at the option of the manufacturer, when the latchplate is released. That stowed position shall prevent any part of the webbing or hardware from being pinched when the adjacent vehicle door is closed. A belt system with a tension-relieving device in an open-bodied vehicle with no doors shall fully retract when the tension-relieving device is deactivated. For the purposes of these retraction requirements, outboard armrests, which are capable of being stowed, on vehicle seats shall be placed in their stowed position.
