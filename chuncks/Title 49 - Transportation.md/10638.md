###### Suicide data

means data regarding the death of an individual due to the individual's commission of suicide as determined by a coroner, public police officer or other public authority or injury to an individual due to that individual's attempted commission of suicide as determined by a public police office or other public authority. Only the death of, or injury to, the individual who committed the suicidal act is suicide data. Therefore, casualties to a person caused by the suicidal act of another person are not considered suicide data.
