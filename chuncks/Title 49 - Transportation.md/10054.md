####### Independent

with respect to a medical facility, means not under the ownership or control of the railroad and not operated or staffed by a salaried officer or employee of the railroad. The fact that the railroad pays for services rendered by a medical facility or laboratory, selects that entity for performing tests under this part, or has a standing contractual relationship with that entity to perform tests under this part or perform other medical examinations or tests of railroad employees does not, by itself, remove the facility from this definition.
