(1)Vehicle manufacturers producing vehicles intended for off-road may exempt vehicles without requesting approval from the agencies subject to the criteria in ยง 535.5(b)(9)(i) and 40 CFR 1037.631(a). If unusual circumstances exist and a manufacturer is uncertain as to whether its vehicles qualify, the manufacturer should ask for a preliminary determination from the agencies before submitting its application for certification in accordance with 40 CFR 1037.205 for the applicable vehicles. Send the request with supporting information to EPA and the agencies will coordinate in making a preliminary determination as specified in 40 CFR 1037.210. These decisions are considered to be preliminary approvals and subject to final review and approval.
