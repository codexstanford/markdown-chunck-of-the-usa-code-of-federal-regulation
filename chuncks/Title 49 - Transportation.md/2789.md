(2) Referring the employee to an appropriate education and/or treatment program;

(3) Conducting a face-to-face follow-up evaluation to determine if the employee has actively participated in the education and/or treatment program and has demonstrated successful compliance with the initial assessment and evaluation recommendations;

(4) Providing the DER with a follow-up drug and/or alcohol testing plan for the employee; and
