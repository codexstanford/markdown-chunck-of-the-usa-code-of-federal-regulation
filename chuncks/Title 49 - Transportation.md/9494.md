####### Flattened rail

(9)means a short length of rail, not at a joint, which has flattened out across the width of the rail head to a depth ofinch or more below the rest of the rail and 8 inches or more in length. Flattened rail occurrences have no repetitive regularity and thus do not include corrugations, and have no apparent localized cause such as a weld or engine burn. Their individual length is relatively short, as compared to a condition such as head flow on the low rail of curves.
