####### ยง 386.64 Reconsideration.

(a) Within 20 days following service of the Final Agency Order, any party may petition the Assistant Administrator for reconsideration of the order. If a civil penalty was imposed, the filing of a petition for reconsideration stays the entire action, unless the Assistant Administrator orders otherwise.

(b) In the event a Notice of Default and Final Agency Order is issued by the Field Administrator as a result of the respondent's failure to reply in accordance with ยง 386.14(a), the only issue that will be considered upon reconsideration is whether a default has occurred under ยง 386.14(c). The Final Agency Order may be vacated where a respondent can demonstrate excusable neglect, a meritorious defense, or due diligence in seeking relief.

(c) Either party may serve an answer to a petition for reconsideration within 30 days of the service date of the petition.

(d) Following the close of the 30-day period, the Assistant Administrator will rule on the petition.

(e) The ruling on the petition will be the Final Agency Order. A petition for reconsideration of the Assistant Administrator's ruling will not be permitted.
