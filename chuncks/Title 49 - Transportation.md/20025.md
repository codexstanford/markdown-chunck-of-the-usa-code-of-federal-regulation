(4) The target area designated by the original vehicle manufacturer for the parts subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be maintained for the duration of the production of such replacement part, unless a restyling of the part makes it no longer practicable to mark the part within the original target area. If there is such a restyling, the original vehicle manufacturer shall inform NHTSA of that fact and the new target area, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

(f) Each replacement part must bear the symbol "DOT" in letters at least one centimeter high within 5 centimeters of the trademark and of the letter "R", and entirely within the target area specified under paragraph (d) of this section. The symbol "DOT" constitutes the manufacturer's certification that the replacement part conforms to the applicable theft prevention standard, and shall be inscribed or affixed by means that comply with paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of replacement parts subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, which were not originally manufactured for sale in the United States, the importer shall inscribe the "DOT" symbol before the part is imported into the United States.
