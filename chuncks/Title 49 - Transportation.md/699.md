###### et seq.,

(b) If you are a primary airport that does not now have a DBE concessions program, and you apply for a grant of FAA funds for airport planning and development under 49 U.S.C. 47107you must submit an ACDBE program to the FAA at the time of your application. Timely submission and FAA approval of your ACDBE program are conditions of eligibility for FAA financial assistance.

(c) If you are the owner of more than one airport that is required to have an ACDBE program, you may implement one plan for all your locations. If you do so, you must establish a separate ACDBE goal for each location.

(d) If you make any significant changes to your ACDBE program at any time, you must provide the amended program to the FAA for approval before implementing the changes.

(e) If you are a non-primary airport, non-commercial service airport, a general aviation airport, reliever airport, or any other airport that does not have scheduled commercial service, you are not required to have an ACDBE program. However, you must take appropriate outreach steps to encourage available ACDBEs to participate as concessionaires whenever there is a concession opportunity.
