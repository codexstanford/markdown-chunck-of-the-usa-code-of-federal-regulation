####### ยง 1152.32 Calculation of avoidable costs.

This section defines: Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of avoidable costs; the conditions under which certain cost elements become eligible for inclusion; and the basis of apportioning those cost elements which are not assigned to the branch on an actual expense basis. The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch shall be the total of the costs assigned to the branch in accordance with this section. The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch shall be just and reasonable, and shall not exceed those necessary for an honest and efficient operation. Those expenses apportioned under this section shall be derived from the latest Form R-1 Annual Report for Class I railroads filed with the Board prior to the conclusion of the subsidy year, and company records for all non-Class I railroads, and assigned to the branch according to the procedures set forth in ยง 1152.33 of these regulations. When the term "Actual" is specified as the basis for assigning an expense, it shall mean that the only costs which can be assigned to the account are those costs which are incurred solely as a result of the continuation of rail freight service on the branch. The accounts in the following charts, which list only the "freight-only" account numbers, shall include the portion of common expenses that have been apportioned to freight service.
