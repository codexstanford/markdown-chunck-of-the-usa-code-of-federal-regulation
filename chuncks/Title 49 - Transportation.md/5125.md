(o)Each tank car must have an insulation system so that the thermal conductance is not more than 0.613 kilojoules per hour, per square meter, per degree Celsius (0.03 B.t.u. per square foot per hour, per degree Fahrenheit) temperature differential. Each tank car must be equipped with one reclosing pressure relief valve having a start-to-discharge pressure not to exceed 75 percent of the tank test pressure and one non-reclosing pressure relief valve having a rupture disc design to burst at a pressure less than the tank test pressure. The discharge capacity of each pressure relief device must be sufficient to prevent building up of pressure in the tank in excess of 82.5 percent of the test pressure of the tank. Tanks must be equipped with two regulating valves set to open at a pressure not to exceed 24.1 Bar (350 psi) on DOT 105A500W tanks and at a pressure not to exceed 27.6 Bar (400 psi) on DOT 105A600W tanks. Each regulating valve and pressure relief device must have its final discharge piped to the outside of the protective housing.
