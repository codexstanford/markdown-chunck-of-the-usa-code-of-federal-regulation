###### Subpart A - General Information and Regulations
####### § 175.10 Exceptions for passengers, crewmembers, and air operators.
######## e.g.,,e.g.,

(14) Battery powered heat-producing devices (battery-operated equipment such as diving lamps and soldering equipment) as checked or carry-on baggage and with the approval of the operator of the aircraft. The heating element, the battery, or other component (fuse) must be isolated to prevent unintentional activation during transport. Any battery that is removed must be carried in accordance with the provisions for spare batteries in paragraph (a)(18) of this section. Each installed or spare lithium battery:

(i) For a lithium metal battery, a lithium content must not exceed 2 grams; or

(ii) For a lithium ion battery, the Watt-hour rating must not exceed 100 Wh.

(15) A wheelchair or other battery-powered mobility aid equipped with a non-spillable battery or a dry sealed battery when carried as checked baggage, provided-

(i) The battery conforms to the requirements of § 173.159a(d) of this subchapter for non-spillable batteries;

(ii) The battery conforms to the requirements of § 172.102(c)(1), special provision 130 of this subchapter for dry sealed batteries, as applicable;

(iii) Visual inspection including removal of the battery, where necessary, reveals no obvious defects (removal of the battery from the housing should be performed by qualified airline personnel only);

(iv) The battery is disconnected and the battery terminals are protected to prevent short circuits, unless the wheelchair or mobility aid design provides an effective means of preventing unintentional activation;

(v) The non-spillable battery is-

(A) Securely attached to the wheelchair or mobility aid;

(B) Removed and placed in a strong, rigid packaging marked "NONSPILLABLE BATTERY" (unless fully enclosed in a rigid housing that is properly marked); or

(C) Is handled in accordance with paragraph (a)(16)(iv) of this section; and

(vi) The dry sealed battery is-

(A) Securely attached to the wheelchair or mobility aid; or

(B) Removed and placed in a strong, rigid packaging marked with the words "not restricted" in accordance with § 172.102(c)(2), special provision 130, of this subchapter;

(vii) A maximum of one spare battery that conforms to the requirements in (a)(15)(i) or (ii) may be carried per passenger if handled in accordance with paragraph (a)(15)(v) or (vi) of this section, as applicable.

(16) A wheelchair or other battery-powered mobility aid equipped with a spillable battery, when carried as checked baggage, provided-

(i) Visual inspection including removal of the battery, where necessary, reveals no obvious defects (however, removal of the battery from the housing should be performed by qualified airline personnel only);

(ii) The battery is disconnected and terminals are insulated to prevent short circuits;

(iii) The pilot-in-command is advised, either orally or in writing, prior to departure, as to the location of the battery aboard the aircraft; and

(iv) The wheelchair or mobility aid is loaded, stowed, secured and unloaded in an upright position, or the battery is removed, and carried in a strong, rigid packaging under the following conditions:

(A) The packaging must be leak-tight and impervious to battery fluid. An inner liner may be used to satisfy this requirement if there is absorbent material placed inside of the liner and the liner has a leakproof closure;

(B) The battery must be protected against short circuits, secured upright in the packaging, and be packaged with enough compatible absorbent material to completely absorb liquid contents in the event of rupture of the battery; and

(C) The packaging must be labeled with a CORROSIVE label, marked to indicate proper orientation, and marked with the words "Battery, wet, with wheelchair."

(17) A wheelchair or other mobility aid equipped with a lithium ion battery, when carried as checked baggage, provided-

(i) The lithium ion battery must be of a type that successfully passed each test in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), as specified in § 173.185 of this subchapter, unless approved by the Associate Administrator;

(ii) The operator must verify that:

(A) Visual inspection of the wheelchair or other mobility aid reveals no obvious defects;

(B) Battery terminals are protected from short circuits (e.g., enclosed within a battery housing);

(C) The battery must be securely attached to the mobility aid; and

(D) Electrical circuits are isolated;

(iii) The wheelchair or other mobility aid must be loaded and stowed in such a manner to prevent its unintentional activation and its battery must be protected from short circuiting;

(iv) The wheelchair or other mobility aid must be protected from damage by the shifting of baggage, mail, service items, or other cargo;

(v) Where a lithium ion battery-powered wheelchair or other mobility aid does not provide adequate protection to the battery:

(A) The battery must be removed from the wheelchair or other mobility aid according to instructions provided by the wheelchair or other mobility aid owner or its manufacturer;

(B) The battery must be carried in carry-on baggage only;

(C) Battery terminals must be protected from short circuits (by placement in original retail packaging or otherwise insulating the terminal e.g. by taping over exposed terminals or placing each battery in a separate plastic bag or protective pouch);

(D) The battery must not exceed 300 Watt-hour (Wh); and

(E) A maximum of one spare battery not exceeding 300 Wh or two spares not exceeding 160 Wh each may be carried;

(vi) The pilot-in-command is advised either orally or in writing, prior to departure, as to the location of the lithium ion battery or batteries aboard the aircraft.
