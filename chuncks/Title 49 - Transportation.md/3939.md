######## Hazardous substances.

(c)(1) Except for Class 7 (radioactive) materials described in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, if the proper shipping name for a material that is a hazardous substance does not identify the hazardous substance by name, the name of the hazardous substance must be entered in parentheses in association with the basic description. If the material contains two or more hazardous substances, at least two hazardous substances, including the two with the lowest reportable quantities (RQs), must be identified. For a hazardous waste, the waste code (e.g., D001), if appropriate, may be used to identify the hazardous substance.

(2) The letters "RQ" must be entered on the shipping paper either before or after the basic description required by ยง 172.202 for each hazardous substance (see definition in ยง 171.8 of this subchapter). For example: "RQ, UN 1098, Allyl alcohol, 6.1, I, Toxic-inhalation hazard, Zone B"; or "UN 3077, Environmentally hazardous substances, solid, n.o.s., 9, III, RQ (Adipic acid)".
