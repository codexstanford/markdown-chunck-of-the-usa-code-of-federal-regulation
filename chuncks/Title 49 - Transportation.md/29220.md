###### Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.

2-13

(a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but the resulting track extensions or reductions shall be accounted for as additions or retirements as appropriate.

(b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take the place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be accounted for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the property account.
