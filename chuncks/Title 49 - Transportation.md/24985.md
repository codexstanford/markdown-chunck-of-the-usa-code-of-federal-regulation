###### ยง 572.73 Neck assembly and test procedure.
####### Neck assembly impact response requirements.

(b)When the head-neck assembly (SA 106C 010 and SA 106C 020) is tested according to the test procedure in ยง 572.73(c), the head:

(1) Shall rotate, while translating in the direction of the pendulum preimpact flight, in reference to the pendulum's longitudinal center line a total of 78 degrees +/-6 degrees about the head's center of gravity; and

(2) Shall rotate to the extent specified in Table B at each indicated point in time, measured from time of impact, with the chordal displacement measured at the head's center of gravity.

(i) Chordal displacement at time "T" is defined as the straight line distance between the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head's center of gravity at time "zero;" and the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head's center of gravity at time T as illustrated by Figure 3 in ยง 572.11.

(ii) The peak resultant acceleration recorded at the location of the accelerometers mounted in the headform according to ยง 572.77(b) shall not exceed 30g.

(3) The pendulum shall not reverse direction until the head's center of gravity returns to the original "zero" time position relative to the pendulum arm.
