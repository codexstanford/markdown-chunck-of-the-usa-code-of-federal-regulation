###### Determining the country of origin of components.

(c)(1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item of equipment is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item (the U.S. and Canada are treated separately).

(2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all components.
