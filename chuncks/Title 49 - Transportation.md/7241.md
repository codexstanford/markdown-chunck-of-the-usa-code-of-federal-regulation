####### ยง 179.500-4 Thickness of wall.

(a) Minimum thickness of wall of each finished tank shall be such that at a pressure equal toof the marked test pressure of the tank, the calculated fiber stress in psi at inner wall of tank multiplied by 3.0 will not exceed the tensile strength of any specimen taken from the tank and tested as prescribed in ยง 179.500-7(b). Minimum wall thickness shall beinch.

(b) Calculations to determine the maximum marked test pressure permitted to be marked on the tank shall be made by the formula:

(c) Measure at one end, in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tank and at least 18 inches from that end before necking-down:

(1) Make similar measurements and calculation for a corresponding location at the other end of the tank.

(2) Use the smaller result obtained, from the foregoing, in making calculations prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
