####### Rear unit.

(b)The rear unit shall be capable of determining the brake pipe pressure on the rear car and transmitting that information to the front unit for display to the locomotive engineer. The rear unit shall be-

(1) Capable of measuring the brake pipe pressure on the rear car with an accuracy of +/-3 pounds per square inch (psig) and brake pipe pressure variations of +/-1 psig;

(2) Equipped with a "bleeder valve" that permits the release of any air under pressure from the rear of train unit or the associated air hoses prior to detaching the rear unit from the brake pipe;

(3) Designed so that an internal failure will not cause an undesired emergency brake application;

(4) Equipped with either an air gauge or a means of visually displaying the rear unit's brake pipe pressure measurement; and

(5) Equipped with a pressure relief safety valve to prevent explosion from a high pressure air leak inside the rear unit.
