####### Head injury criteria.

S6.2(a)(1) For any two points in time, tand t, during the event which are separated by not more than a 36 millisecond time interval and where tis less than t, the head injury criterion (HIC) shall be determined using the resultant head acceleration at the center of gravity of the dummy head, a, expressed as a multiple of g (the acceleration of gravity) and shall be calculated using the expression:

(2) The maximum calculated HICvalue shall not exceed 1,000.

(b)(1) For any two points in time, tand t, during the event which are separated by not more than a 15 millisecond time interval and where tis less than t, the head injury criterion (HIC) shall be determined using the resultant head acceleration at the center of gravity of the dummy head, a, expressed as a multiple of g (the acceleration of gravity) and shall be calculated using the expression:

(2) The maximum calculated HICvalue shall not exceed 700.

S6.3 The resultant acceleration calculated from the output of the thoracic instrumentation shown in drawing 78051.218, revision R incorporated by reference in part 572, subpart E of this chapter shall not exceed 60 g's, except for intervals whose cumulative duration is not more than 3 milliseconds.
