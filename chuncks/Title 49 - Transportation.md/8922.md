####### ยง 195.418 Valves: Onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.
######## Laterals.

(3)Laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume may have RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as long as all of these laterals contributing hazardous liquid volumes to the shut-off segment do not contribute more than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume, based upon maximum flow volume at the operating pressure. A check valve may be used as an alternative equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into the lateral. Check valves used as an alternative equivalent technology in accordance with this paragraph are not subject to ยง 195.419 but must be inspected, operated, and remediated in accordance with ยง 195.420, including for closure and leakage, to ensure operational reliability. An operator using a such a valve as an alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to PHMSA in accordance with ยง 195.18.
