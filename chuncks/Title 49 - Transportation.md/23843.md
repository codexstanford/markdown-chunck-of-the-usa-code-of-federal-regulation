####### Breaking strength.

(b)Webbing from three seat belt assemblies shall be conditioned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and tested for breaking strength in a testing machine of capacity verified to have an error of not more than one percent in the range of the breaking strength of the webbing in accordance with ASTM E4-79 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5). The machine shall be equipped with split drum grips illustrated in Figure 1, having a diameter between 51 and 102 mm. The rate of grip separation shall be between 51 and 102 mm per minute. The distance between the centers of the grips at the start of the test shall be between 102 and 254 mm. After placing the specimen in the grips, the webbing shall be stretched continuously at a uniform rate to failure. Each value shall be not less than the applicable breaking strength requirement in S4.2(b), but the median value shall be used for determining the retention of breaking strength in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section.
