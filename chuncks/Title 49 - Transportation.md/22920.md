####### Reference Speed Determination.

S7.7.1.2Using the Preliminary Reference Speed determined in S7.7.1.1, perform two series of test runs using the J-Turn test maneuver to determine the Reference Speed. The first series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using counter-clockwise steering. The second series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using clockwise steering. During each test run, the driver attempts to maintain a speed equal to the Preliminary Reference Speed throughout the J-Turn test maneuver. The Reference Speed is the minimum entrance speed at which ESC service brake application occurs for at least two of four consecutive test runs of each series conducted at the same entrance speed (within +/-1.6 km/h (+/-1.0 mph)). The Reference Speed is determined for each direction: clockwise steering and counter-clockwise steering. If ESC service brake application does not occur during at least two test runs of either series, the Preliminary Reference Speed is increased by 1.6 km/h (1.0 mph), and the procedure in this section is repeated.
