###### Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report (Supplements or Employee Supplements).

(g)(1) Employee Statements Supplementing Railroad Accident Reports are voluntary, not mandatory; nonsubmission of a Supplement does not imply that the employee admits or endorses the railroad's conclusions as to cause or any other allegations.

(2) Although a Supplement is completely optional and not required, if an employee wishes to submit a Supplement and assure that, after receipt, it will be properly placed by FRA in a file with the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and that it will be required to be reviewed by the railroad that issued the Notice, the Supplement must be made on part II of Form FRA F 6180.78 (entitled "Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report"), following the instructions printed on the form. These instructions require that, within 35 days of the date that the Notice was hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) to the employee (except for good cause shown), the original of the Supplement be filed with FRA and a copy be hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) to the railroad that issued the Notice so that the railroad will have an opportunity to reassess its reports to FRA concerning the accident.

(3) Information that the employee wishes to withhold from the railroad must not be included in this Supplement. If an employee wishes to provide confidential information to FRA, the employee should not use the Supplement form (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78, "Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report"), but rather provide such confidential information by other means, such as a letter to the employee's collective bargaining representative, or to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Analysis, RRS-22, Mail Stop 25 West Building 3rd Floor, Room W 33-306, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The letter should include the name of the railroad making the allegations, the date and place of the accident, and the rail equipment accident/incident number.
