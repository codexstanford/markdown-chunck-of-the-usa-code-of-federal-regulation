###### Formula.

(a)Funds appropriated for or reallocated in any fiscal year (in this section referred to jointly as "funds") are to be distributed to each State as follows:

(1) Two-thirds of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a State's rail mileage that, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10904(d), is either potentially subject to abandonment or is to become the subject of an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance which a carrier plans to submit, but has not yet submitted, bears to the total such rail mileage in all the States;

(2) One-third of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a State's rail mileage for which the Commission has found within three years prior to the first day of the fiscal year for which the funds are being allocated that the public convenience and necessity permits the abandonment, or the discontinuance, of rail service on such rail mileage, bears to the total such rail mileage in all the States. Until September 30, 1981, such rail mileage includes the rail mileage which was eligible under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to section 402 of the Rail Act, and all rail mileage which, prior to October 1, 1978, had been included for formula allocation purposes. The Administrator will calculate rail mileage under this paragraph as of October 1 of each year; and

(3) The above calculations will be adjusted if necessary so that no State receives less than 1 percent of the funds appropriated for a fiscal year.
