S14.2.5.7.2

S14.2.5.7.2.1 The maximum effective area of the photometric sensor must fit within a circle whose diameter is equal to 0.009 times the actual test distance from the light source of the sample headlamp to the sensor.

S14.2.5.7.2.2 The sensor effective area is defined as the actual area of intercepted light striking the detector surface of the photometer. Sensor systems incorporating lens(es) that change the diameter of the intercepted light beam before it reaches the actual detector surface, the maximum size requirements must apply to the total area of the light actually intercepted by the lens surface.

S14.2.5.7.2.3 The sensor must be capable of intercepting all direct illumination from the largest illuminated dimension of the sample lamp at the test distance.

S14.2.5.7.3 The color response of the photometer must be corrected to that of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer (2-degree) Photopic Response Curve, as shown in the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5).
