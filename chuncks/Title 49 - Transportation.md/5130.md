######## Odorant fade.

(2)For cargo tanks or portable tanks being transported from a refinery, gas plant or pipeline terminal and in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation. The offeror must have procedures in place to:

(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is being added;

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added;

(iv) Ensure that quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive cargo tanks or portable tanks that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the packaging or receive new or recently cleaned cargo tanks or portable tanks are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures to ensure that potential odorant fade is addressed;

(v) Inspect a cargo tank or portable tank for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorant remains in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.

(c) Except as otherwise provided, the loading of a liquefied gas into a cargo tank or portable tank shall be determined by weight or by a suitable liquid level gauging device. The vapor pressure (psig) at 115 &#xB0;F. must not exceed the design pressure of the cargo tank or portable tank container. The outage and filling limits for liquefied gases must be as prescribed in ยง 173.24b of this part, except that this requirement does not apply to:
