######## Installation of service lines under buildings.

(f)Where an underground service line is installed under a building:

(1) It must be encased in a gas tight conduit;

(2) The conduit and the service line must, if the service line supplies the building it underlies, extend into a normally usable and accessible part of the building; and

(3) The space between the conduit and the service line must be sealed to prevent gas leakage into the building and, if the conduit is sealed at both ends, a vent line from the annular space must extend to a point where gas would not be a hazard, and extend above grade, terminating in a rain and insect resistant fitting.
