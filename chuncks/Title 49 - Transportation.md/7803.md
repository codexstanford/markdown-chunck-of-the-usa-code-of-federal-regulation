######## Integrity management baseline risk-assessment intervals.,see

(2)No later than March 13, 2024, each UNGSF operator must complete the baseline risk assessments of all reservoirs and caverns, and at least 40% of the baseline risk assessments for each of its UNGSF wells (including wellhead assemblies), beginning with the highest-risk wells, as identified by the risk analysis process. No later than March 13, 2027, an operator must complete baseline risk assessments on all its wells (including wellhead assemblies). Operators may use prior risk assessments for a well as a baseline (or part of the baseline) risk assessment in implementing its initial integrity management program, so long as the prior assessments meet the requirements of API RP 1171 (incorporated by reference,ยง 192.7), section 8, and continue to be relevant and valid for the current operating and environmental conditions. When evaluating prior risk-assessment results, operators must account for the growth and effects of indicated defects since the time the assessment was performed.
