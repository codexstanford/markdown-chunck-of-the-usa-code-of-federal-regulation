S7.

The test conditions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of S7 apply to the test procedures in S8.

(a) Vehicle seats are adjusted to their full rearward and full downward position and the seat back is placed in its most upright position. When SFAD 2 is used in testing and cannot be attached to the lower anchorages with the seat back in this position, adjust the seat back as recommended by the manufacturer in its instructions for attaching child restraints. If no instructions are provided, adjust the seat back to the position that enables SFAD 2 to attach to the lower anchorages that is the closest to the most upright position.

(b) Head restraints are adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, provided pursuant to S12, as to how the head restraints should be adjusted when using the child restraint anchorage system. If instructions with regard to head restraint adjustment are not provided pursuant to S12, the head restraints are adjusted to any position.
