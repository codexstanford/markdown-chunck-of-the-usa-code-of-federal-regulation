######## Definitions and requirements,Design pressure

(b)-(1)means the pressure to be used in calculations required by the recognized pressure vessel code. The design pressure must not be less than the highest of the following pressures:

(i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or

(ii) The sum of-

(A) The absolute vapor pressure (in bar) of the hazardous material at 65 &#xB0;C, minus 1 bar (149 &#xB0;F, minus 100 kPa);

(B) The partial pressure (in bar) of air or other gases in the ullage space, resulting from their compression during filling without pressure relief by a maximum ullage temperature of 65 &#xB0;C (149 &#xB0;F) and a liquid expansion due to an increase in mean bulk temperature of 35 &#xB0;C (95 &#xB0;F); and

(C) A head pressure determined on the basis of the forces specified in ยง 178.274(c) of this subchapter, but not less than 0.35 bar (35 kPa).
