##### ยง 535.5 Standards.
###### Subfamily standards.

(4)Manufacturers may generate or use fuel consumption credits for averaging, banking, and trading as described in ยง 535.7(c). This requires that manufacturers calculate a credit quantity if they specify a Family Emission Limit (FEL) that is different than the standard specified in this section. The FEL may not be less than the result of emission and fuel consumption modeling from 40 CFR 1037.520. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the specific vehicle subfamily instead of the standards specified in paragraph (2) of this section.
