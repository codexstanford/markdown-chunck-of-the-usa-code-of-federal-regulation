######## e.g.

(vi) Applications and operations of the train automatic air brake, including emergency applications. The system shall record, or provide a means of determining, that a brake application or release resulted from manipulation of brake controls at the position normally occupied by the locomotive engineer. In the case of a brake application or release that is responsive to a command originating from or executed by an on-board computer (, electronic braking system controller, locomotive electronic control system, or train control computer), the system shall record, or provide a means of determining, the involvement of any such computer;

(vii) Applications and operations of the independent brake, if so equipped;

(viii) Applications and operations of the dynamic brake, if so equipped;

(ix) Cab signal aspect(s), if so equipped and in use;

(x) Emergency brake application(s);

(xi) Wheel slip/slide alarm activation (with a property-specific minimum duration);

(xii) Lead locomotive headlight activation switch on/off;

(xiii) Lead locomotive auxiliary lights activation switch on/off;

(xiv) Horn control handle activation;

(xv) Locomotive number;

(xvi) Locomotive position in consist (lead or trail);

(xvii) Tractive effort;

(xviii) Brakes apply summary train line;

(xix) Brakes released summary train line;

(xx) Cruise control on/off, if so equipped and used; and

(xxi) Safety-critical train control data routed to the locomotive engineer's display with which the engineer is required to comply, specifically including text messages conveying mandatory directives and maximum authorized speed. The format, content, and proposed duration for retention of such data shall be specified in the Product Safety Plan or PTC Safety Plan submitted for the train control system under subparts H or I, respectively, of part 236 of this chapter, subject to FRA approval under this paragraph. If it can be calibrated against other data required by this part, such train control data may, at the election of the railroad, be retained in a separate certified crashworthy memory module.

(5) A locomotive equipped with an event recorder that is remanufactured, as defined in this part, on or after October 1, 2007, shall be equipped with an event recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of appendix D to this part and is capable of recording, at a minimum, the same data as the recorder that was on the locomotive before it was remanufactured.

(6) An event recorder originally manufactured after January 1, 2010, that is installed on any locomotive identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be an event recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of appendix D to this part and that is capable of recording, at a minimum, the same data as the event recorder that was previously on the locomotive.
