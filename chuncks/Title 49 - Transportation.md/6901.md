####### ยง 178.965 Drop test.
######## Drop height.

(e)(1) For all Large Packagings, drop heights are specified as follows:

(i) Packing group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet)

(ii) Packing group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet)

(iii) Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet)

(2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.

(3) The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non-hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:

(i) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for each Large Packaging design type; and

(ii) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:

(A) Packing Group I: SG x 1.5 m (4.9 feet).

(B) Packing Group II: SG x 1.0 m (3.3 feet).

(C) Packing Group III: SG x 0.67 m (2.2 feet).
