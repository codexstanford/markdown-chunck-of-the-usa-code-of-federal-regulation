Later in this interpretive rule, FMCSA explains the applicability of existing statutes and regulations in a question and answer format to clarify the conditions under which highway transportation of passengers by CMV within a single State would constitute interstate commerce if the passengers are beginning a trip to, or completing a trip from, a point outside the State by another mode of transportation (aircraft, railroad, or vessel). It is FMCSA's legal position for purposes of enforcement jurisdiction and motor carrier registration requirements, that, if a passenger plans a trip involving more than one mode of transportation that begins and ends in different States or a place outside the United States and has prearranged the CMV portion of the trip, as demonstrated by an advance guarantee for the service, all transportation during the trip is in interstate commerce, because the passenger prearranged the transportation with persistent intent of continuous interstate movement throughout the trip. Additional prearranged side trips or excursions made before the trip begins or while traveling in interstate commerce are included as part of the flow of interstate commerce. However, if the passenger has made no arrangement for transportation and upon arriving at an airport, port, or railway station, makes arrangements for transportation, that later-arranged transportation is not a continuation of the trip and is not in interstate commerce. Prearrangement in multimodal transportation of a passenger is an important consideration in determining interstate commerce because it can establish the passenger's intent about travel and provide a clear linkage of continual transportation segments. When one such segment is interstate in nature, all linked transportation segments are in the stream of interstate commerce.
