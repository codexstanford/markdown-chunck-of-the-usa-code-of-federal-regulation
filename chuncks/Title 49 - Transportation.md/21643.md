####### Starting time, voltage drop, and flash rate and percent current "on" time tests.

S14.9.3.2.1The power supply used in the standard test circuit for conducting the starting time, the voltage drop, and the flash rate and percent current "on" time tests must comply with the following specifications:

(a) Must not generate any adverse transients not present in motor vehicles;

(b) Be capable of supplying 11-16 vdc for 12 volt flashers and 5-9 vdc for 6 volt flashers to the input terminals of the standard test circuit;

(c) Be capable of supplying required design current(s) continuously and inrush currents as required by the design bulb load complement;

(d) Be capable of supplying an output voltage that does not deviate more than 2% with changes in the static load from 0 to maximum (not including inrush current) nor for static input line voltage variations;

(e) Be capable of supplying an output voltage that does not deviate more than 1.0 vdc from 0 to maximum load (including inrush current) and must recover 63% of its maximum excursion within 100 µsec; and

(f) Have a ripple voltage of 75mv, peak to peak.
