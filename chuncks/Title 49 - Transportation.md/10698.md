###### Design Requirements.

(1)Any electronic record keeping system used to retain a record required to be retained by this part shall meet the following design parameters:

(i) The electronic record system shall be designed such that the integrity of each record is retained through appropriate levels of security such as recognition of an electronic signature, or other means, which uniquely identify the initiating person as the author of that record. No two persons shall have the same electronic identity;

(ii) The electronic system shall ensure that each record cannot be modified, or replaced, once the record is submitted to FRA;

(iii) Any amendment to a record shall be electronically stored apart from the record which it amends. Each amendment to a record shall uniquely identify the person making the amendment and the date the amendment was made;

(iv) The electronic system shall provide for the maintenance of reports as originally submitted to FRA without corruption or loss of data; and

(v) Policies and procedures must be in place to prevent persons from altering electronic records, or otherwise interfering with the electronic system.
