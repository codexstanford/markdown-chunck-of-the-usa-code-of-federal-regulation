(ii) The moment measured by the six axis neck transducer (drawing C-1709, revision D) about the occipital condyles, referenced in Figure 21, shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (lbs-ft) = My-0.058 x Fx, where My is the moment measured in lbs-ft by the "Y" axis moment sensor of the six axis neck transducer and Fx is the force measured in lbs by the "X" axis force sensor (Channel Class 600) of the six axis neck transducer. The moment shall have a maximum value between-39 lbs-ft and -59 lbs-ft, occurring between 65 ms and 79 ms, and the negative moment shall decay for the first time to 0 lb-ft between 120 ms and 148 ms.
