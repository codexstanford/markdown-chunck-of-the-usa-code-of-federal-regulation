This includes safety violations alleging that any components, parts, or accessories of intermodal chassis or trailers, except those listed in ยง 392.7(b) of this chapter, were not in good working order when inspected at roadside. Such violations will not be used by FMCSA in making a safety fitness determination of a motor carrier (unless there is evidence that the driver or motor carrier caused or substantially contributed to the violations) because the driver could not readily detect these violations during a pre-trip inspection performed in accordance with ยง 392.7(b).
