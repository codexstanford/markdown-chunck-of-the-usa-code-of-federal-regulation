####### Side posts and corner braces.

(a)(1) For modified girder, semi-monocoque, or truss construction, the sum of the section moduli in inches-about a longitudinal axis, taken at the weakest horizontal section between the side sill and side plate-of all posts and braces on each side of the car located between the body corner posts shall be not less than 0.30 multiplied by the distance in feet between the centers of end panels.

(2) For modified girder or semi-monocoque construction only, the sum of the section moduli in inches-about a transverse axis, taken at the weakest horizontal section between the side sill and side plate-of all posts, braces and pier panels, to the extent available, on each side of the car located between body corner posts shall be not less than 0.20 multiplied by the distance in feet between the centers of end panels.

(3) The center of an end panel is the point midway between the center of the body corner post and the center of the adjacent side post.

(4) The minimum section moduli or thicknesses specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be adjusted in proportion to the ratio of the yield strength of the material used to that of mild open-hearth steel for a car whose structural members are made of a higher strength steel.
