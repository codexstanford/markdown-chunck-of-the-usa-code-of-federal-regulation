(2) Each demand must contain an affidavit by the party seeking the material or his attorney setting forth the material sought and its relevance to the proceeding, and containing a certification, with support, that the information is not available from other sources, including Board materials described in §§ 837.3 and part 801 of this chapter.

(3) In the absence of General Counsel approval of a demand, the employee is not authorized to comply with the demand.

(4) The General Counsel shall advise the requester of approval or denial of the demand, and may attach whatever conditions to approval considered appropriate or necessary to promote the purposes of this part.
