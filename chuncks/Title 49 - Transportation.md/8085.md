####### § 192.624 Maximum allowable operating pressure reconfirmation: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.
######## Method 2: Pressure Reduction.,i.e.,

(2)Reduce pressure, as necessary, and limit MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii). The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during a continuous 30-day period. The value used as the highest actual sustained operating pressure must account for differences between upstream and downstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest maximum pressure value for the entire pipeline segment or using the operating pressure gradient along the entire pipeline segment (the location-specific operating pressure at each location).

(i) Where the pipeline segment has had a class location change in accordance with § 192.611, and records documenting diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength), and pressure tests are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must reduce the pipeline segment MAOP as follows:

(A) For pipeline segments where a class location changed from Class 1 to Class 2, from Class 2 to Class 3, or from Class 3 to Class 4, reduce the pipeline MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.39 for Class 1 to Class 2, 1.67 for Class 2 to Class 3, and 2.00 for Class 3 to Class 4.

(B) For pipeline segments where a class location changed from Class 1 to Class 3, reduce the pipeline MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 2.00.

(ii) Future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart K is allowed if the MAOP is established using Method 2.

(iii) If an operator elects to use Method 2, but desires to use a less conservative pressure reduction factor or longer look-back period, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 no later than 7 calendar days after establishing the reduced MAOP. The notification must include the following details:

(A) Descriptions of the operational constraints, special circumstances, or other factors that preclude, or make it impractical, to use the pressure reduction factor specified in § 192.624(c)(2);

(B) The fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis that complies with § 192.712;

(C) Justification that establishing MAOP by another method allowed by this section is impractical;

(D) Justification that the reduced MAOP determined by the operator is safe based on analysis of the condition of the pipeline segment, including material properties records, material properties verified in accordance § 192.607, and the history of the pipeline segment, particularly known corrosion and leakage, and the actual operating pressure, and additional compensatory preventive and mitigative measures taken or planned; and

(E) Planned duration for operating at the requested MAOP, long-term remediation measures and justification of this operating time interval, including fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue growth analysis and other validated forms of engineering analysis that have been reviewed and confirmed by subject matter experts.
