####### Electronic stability control system,ESC system

ormeans a system that has all of the following attributes:

(1) It augments vehicle directional stability by having the means to apply and adjust the vehicle brake torques individually at each wheel position on at least one front and at least one rear axle of the truck tractor or bus to induce correcting yaw moment to limit vehicle oversteer and to limit vehicle understeer;

(2) It enhances rollover stability by having the means to apply and adjust the vehicle brake torques individually at each wheel position on at least one front and at least one rear axle of the truck tractor or bus to reduce lateral acceleration of a vehicle;

(3) It is computer-controlled with the computer using a closed-loop algorithm to induce correcting yaw moment and enhance rollover stability;

(4) It has a means to determine the vehicle's lateral acceleration;

(5) It has a means to determine the vehicle's yaw rate and to estimate its side slip or side slip derivative with respect to time;

(6) It has a means to estimate vehicle mass or, if applicable, combination vehicle mass;

(7) It has a means to monitor driver steering inputs;

(8) It has a means to modify engine torque, as necessary, to assist the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle and/or combination vehicle; and

(9) When installed on a truck tractor, it has the means to provide brake pressure to automatically apply and modulate the brake torques of a towed trailer.
