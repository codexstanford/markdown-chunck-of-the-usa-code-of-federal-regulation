#### PART 583 - AUTOMOBILE PARTS CONTENT LABELING
##### ยง 583.6 Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content.

(a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in ยง 583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian Parts Content for each carline on a model year basis. This determination shall be made before the beginning of each model year. Items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied supplier. All value otherwise added at the final assembly point and beyond, including all final assembly costs, is excluded from the calculation of U.S./Canadian parts content. The country of origin of nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate rinse, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, tire assembly fluid, rivets, adhesives, grommets, and wheel weights, used in final assembly of the vehicle, is considered to be the country where final assembly of the vehicle takes place.
