####### Test Procedures.

S5.3.2

S5.3.2.1 Force the test cleat, as defined in S5.3.2.2, with its length axis (see S5.3.2.2(a)) parallel to the rolling axis of the non-pneumatic tire assembly, and its height axis (see S5.3.2.2(c)), coinciding with a radius of the non-pneumatic tire assembly, into the tread of the tire at five test points equally spaced around the circumference of the tire. At each test point, the test cleat is forced into the tire at a rate of two inches per minute until the applicable minimum energy level, as shown in S4.2.2.4, calculated using the formula contained in S5.3.2.3, is reached.

S5.3.2.2 The test cleat is made of steel and has the following dimensions;

(a) Minimum length of one inch greater than the maximum tire width of the tire,

(b) Width of one-half inch with the surface which contacts the tire's tread having one-quarter inch radius, and

(c) Minimum height of one inch greater than the difference between the unloaded radius of the non-pneumatic tire assembly and the maximum radius of the non-pneumatic rim or wheel center member, if used with the non-pneumatic tire assembly being tested.

S5.3.2.3 The energy level is calculated by the following formula:
