####### ยง 195.567 Which pipelines must have test leads and what must I do to install and maintain the leads?
######## Installation.

(b)You must install test leads as follows:

(1) Locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain electrical measurements indicating the adequacy of cathodic protection.

(2) Provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly stress or break the lead and the lead will otherwise remain mechanically secure and electrically conductive.

(3) Prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on pipe.

(4) For leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from the conduit.

(5) At the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area with an electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.
