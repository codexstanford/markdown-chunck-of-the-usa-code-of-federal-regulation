######## Nonreclosing pressure relief device.

(f)In addition to paragraphs (a), (b)(4), (c), and (d) of this section, a nonreclosing pressure relief device must conform to the following requirements:

(1) A non-reclosing pressure relief device must incorporate a rupture disc designed to burst at a pressure equal to the greater of 100% of the tank test pressure, or 33% of the tank burst pressure.

(2) The approach channel and the discharge channel may not reduce the required minimum flow capacity of the pressure relief device.

(3) The non-reclosing pressure relief device must be designed to prevent interchange with other fittings installed on the tank car, must have a structure that encloses and clamps the rupture disc in position (preventing any distortion or damage to the rupture disc when properly applied), and must have a cover, with suitable means of preventing misplacement, designed to direct any discharge of the lading downward.

(4) The non-reclosing pressure relief device must be closed with a rupture disc that is compatible with the lading and manufactured in accordance with Appendix A of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars. The tolerance for a rupture disc is + 0 to -15 percent of the burst pressure marked on the disc.
