S5.2.3.3 If a primary quadrant contains only one target center, that target is the primary target for that quadrant (Figure 3) (figure provided for illustration purposes). If there is more than one target center in a primary quadrant, the primary target for that quadrant is the lowest target in a lower quadrant and the highest target in an upper quadrant. If there is a primary quadrant that does not contain a target center, the target center closest to the primary quadrant outline is the primary target.
