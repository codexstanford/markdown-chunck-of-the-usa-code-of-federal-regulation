(i) If the Agency Official determines the motor carrier's registration should be suspended, he or she will enter an order suspending the motor carrier's registration; or

(ii) If the Agency Official determines the motor carrier's registration should not be suspended, he or she will enter an order terminating the proceeding.

(2) If the Agency Official issues an order to suspend the motor carrier's registration, the order will:

(i) Provide notice to the motor carrier of the right to petition the Assistant Administrator for review of the order within 15 days of service of the order suspending the registration, and provide notice of the procedures in ยง 385.911(e);

(ii) Provide notice that a timely petition for review will stay the effective date of the order unless the Assistant Administrator orders otherwise for good cause; and
