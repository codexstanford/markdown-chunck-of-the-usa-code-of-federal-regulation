####### Water content of motor vehicle brake fluids.

S7.2Use analytical methods based on ASTM D1123-59 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5) for determining the water content of brake fluids, or other methods of analysis yielding comparable results. To be acceptable for use, such other method must measure the weight of water added to samples of the SAE RM-66-04 (see Appendix A of SAE Standard J1703 NOV83 (incorporated by reference in ยง 571.5)) and TEGME Compatibility Fluids (see Appendix B of SAE Standard J1703 JAN95 (incorporated by reference in ยง 571.5)) within +/-15 percent of the water added for additions up to 0.8 percent by weight, and within +/-5 percent of the water added for additions greater than 0.8 percent by weight. The SAE RM-66-04 Compatibility Fluid used to prepare the samples must have an original ERBP of not less than 205 &#xB0;C (401 &#xB0;F) when tested in accordance with S6.1. The SAE TEGME fluid used to prepare the samples must have an original ERBP of not less than 240 &#xB0;C (464 &#xB0;F) when tested in accordance with S6.1.
