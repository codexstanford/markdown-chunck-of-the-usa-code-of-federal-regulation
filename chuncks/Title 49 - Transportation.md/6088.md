######## Pressure testing.

(i)Each cylinder, before insulating and jacketing, must successfully withstand a pressure test as follows:

(1) The cylinder must be tested by the proof pressure, water-jacket, or direct expansion test method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR; see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

(2) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

(3) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1 5.7.2 or 7.1.2. Determination of expansion properties is not required.

(4) There must be no evidence of leakage, visible distortion or other defect.
