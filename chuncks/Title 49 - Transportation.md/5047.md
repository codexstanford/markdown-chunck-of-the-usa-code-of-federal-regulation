######## Pressure testing.

(v)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each container, after it is filled, must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath; the temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F), or 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F)). If the contents are sensitive to heat, the temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) and 30 &#xB0;C (86 &#xB0;F) but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container may occur. However, instead of this standard water bath test, container(s) may be tested using one of the following methods subject to certain conditions-
