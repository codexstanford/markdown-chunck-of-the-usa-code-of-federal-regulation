######## Analysis of rupture and valve shut-offs; preventive and mitigative measures.

(ii)If a failure or accident on an onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline involves the closure of a rupture-mitigation valve (RMV), as defined in ยง 195.2, or the closure of an alternative equivalent technology, the operator of the pipeline must also conduct a post-failure or -accident analysis of all of the factors that may have impacted the release volume and the consequences of the release and identify and implement operations and maintenance measures to minimize the consequences of a future failure or incident. The analysis must include all relevant factors impacting the release volume and consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:

(A) Detection, identification, operational response, system shut-off, and emergency-response communications, based on the type and volume of the release or failure event;

(B) Appropriateness and effectiveness of procedures and pipeline systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), communications, valve shut-off, and operator personnel;

(C) Actual response time from identifying a rupture following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at ยง 195.2, to initiation of mitigative actions and isolation of the segment, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the mitigative actions taken;

(D) Location and timeliness of actuation of all RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies; and

(E) All other factors the operator deems appropriate.
