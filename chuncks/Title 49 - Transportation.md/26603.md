(d) FTA will assign overall ratings for proposed Small Starts projects by averaging the summary ratings for project justification and local financial commitment. When the average of these ratings is unclear (e.g., summary project justification rating of "medium-high" and summary local financial commitment rating of "medium"), FTA will round up the overall rating to the higher rating except in the following circumstances:

(1) A "medium" overall rating requires a rating of at least "medium" on both project justification and local financial commitment.

(2) If a project receives a "low" rating on either project justification or local financial commitment, the overall rating will be "low."
