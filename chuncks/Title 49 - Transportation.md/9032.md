(2) Risk factors an operator can use to determine an integrity assessment schedule;

(3) Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line size, age of pipeline, and product transported, an operator may use to determine if a pipeline segment falls into a high, medium or low risk category;

(4) Types of internal inspection tools an operator could use to find pipeline anomalies;

(5) Measures an operator could use to measure an integrity management program's performance; and

(6) Types of records an operator will have to maintain.

(7) Types of conditions that an integrity assessment may identify that an operator should include in its required schedule for evaluation and remediation.
