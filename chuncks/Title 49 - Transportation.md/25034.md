(2)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure N3, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 85 degrees and 103 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyles shall be not more than -19 N-m (-14 ft-lbf) and not less than -24 N-m (-17.7ft-lbf).

(ii) The negative moment shall decay for the first time to -5 N-m (-3.7 ft-lbf) between 123 ms and 147 ms.

(iii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = M-(0.01778m) x (F).

(iv) Mis the moment about the y-axis and Fis the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) and 0.017778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.

(3) Time-zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material.
