######## Driver physical conditions.

(f)(1) Intrastate drivers who do not meet the physical qualification standards in ยง 391.41 of this subchapter may continue to be qualified to operate a CMV in intrastate commerce if:

(i) The driver was qualified under existing State law or regulation at the time the State adopted physical qualification standards consistent with the Federal standards in ยง 391.41 of this subchapter;

(ii) The otherwise non-qualifying medical or physical condition has not substantially worsened; and

(iii) No other non-qualifying medical or physical condition has developed.

(2) The State may adopt or continue programs granting variances to intrastate drivers with medical or physical conditions that would otherwise be non-qualifying under the State's equivalent of ยง 391.41 of this subchapter if the variances are based on sound medical judgment combined with appropriate performance standards ensuring no adverse effect on safety.

(3) A State that has physical qualification standards or variances continued in effect or adopted by the State under this paragraph for drivers operating CMVs in intrastate commerce has the option not to adopt laws and regulations that establish a separate registry of medical examiners trained and qualified to apply such physical qualification standards or variances.
