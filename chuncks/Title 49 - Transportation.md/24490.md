####### Location of the tether anchorage.

S6.2A vehicle manufactured on or after September 1, 1999 and before September 1, 2004 may, at the manufacturer's option (with said option irrevocably selected prior to, or at the time of, certification of the vehicle), meet the requirements of S6.2.1 or S6.2.2. Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 2004 must meet the requirements of S6.2.1 of this standard.

S6.2.1 Subject to S6.2.1.1 and S6.2.1.2, the part of each tether anchorage that attaches to a tether hook must be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 3 to 7 of this standard of the designated seating position for which it is installed. The zone is defined with reference to the seating reference point (see § 571.3). (For purposes of the figures, "H Point" is defined to mean seating reference point.) A tether anchorage may be recessed in the seat back, provided that it is not in the strap wrap-around area at the top of the vehicle seat back. For the area under the vehicle seat, the forwardmost edge of the shaded zone is defined by the torso line reference plane.

S6.2.1.1 In the case of passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles manufactured before September 1, 2004, the part of each user-ready tether anchorage that attaches to a tether hook may, at the manufacturer's option (with said option selected prior to, or at the time of, certification of the vehicle), instead of complying with S6.2.1, be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 8 to 11 of this standard of the designated seating position for which it is installed, relative to the shoulder reference point of the three dimensional H-point machine described in section 3.1 of SAE Standard J826-1992 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) such that-

(a) The H-point of the three dimensional H-point machine is located-

(1) At the actual H-point of the seat, as defined in section 2.2.11.3 of SAE Recommended Practice J1100-1993 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5), at the full rearward and downward position of the seat; or

(2) In the case of a designated seating position that has a child restraint anchorage system, midway between vertical longitudinal planes passing through the lateral center of the bar in each of the two lower anchorages of that system; and

(b) The back pan of the H-point machine is at the same angle to the vertical as the vehicle seat back with the seat adjusted to its full rearward and full downward position and the seat back in its most upright position.

S6.2.1.2 In the case of a vehicle that-

(a) Has a user-ready tether anchorage for which no part of the shaded zone shown in Figures 3 to 7 of this standard of the designated seating position for which the anchorage is installed is accessible without removing a seating component of the vehicle; and

(b) Has a tether strap routing device that is-

(1) Not less than 65 mm behind the torso line for that seating position, in the case of a flexible routing device or a deployable routing device, measured horizontally and in a vertical longitudinal plane; or

(2) Not less than 100 mm behind the torso line for that seating position, in the case of a fixed rigid routing device, measured horizontally and in a vertical longitudinal plane, the part of that anchorage that attaches to a tether hook may, at the manufacturer's option (with said option selected prior to, or at the time of, certification of the vehicle) be located outside that zone.

(c) The measurement of the location of the flexible or deployable routing device described in S6.2.1.2(b)(1) is made with SFAD 2 properly attached to the lower anchorages. A 40 mm wide nylon tether strap is routed through the routing device and attached to the tether anchorage in accordance with the written instructions required by S12 of this standard. The forwardmost contact point between the strap and the routing device must be within the stated limit when the tether strap is flat against the top surface of the SFAD and tensioned to 55 to 65 N. In seating positions without lower anchorages of a child restraint anchorage system, the SFAD 2 is held with its central lateral plane in the central vertical longitudinal plane of the seating position. The adjustable anchor attaching bars of the SFAD 2 are replaced by spacers that end flush with the back surface of the SFAD.

S6.2.2 Subject to S6.2.2.1 and S6.2.2.2, the portion of each user-ready tether anchorage that is designed to bind with a tether strap hook shall be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 3 to 7 of this standard of the designated seating position for which it is installed, with reference to the H-point of a template described in section 3.1 of SAE Standard J826-1992 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5), if:

(a) The H-point of the template is located-

(1) At the unique Design H-point of the designated seating position, as defined in section 2.2.11.1 of SAE Recommended Practice J1100-1993 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5), at the full downward and full rearward position of the seat, or-

(2) In the case of a designated seating position that has a means of affixing the lower portion of a child restraint system to the vehicle, other than a vehicle seat belt, midway between the two lower restraint system anchorages;

(b) The torso line of the template is at the same angle to the transverse vertical plane as the vehicle seat back with the seat adjusted to its full rearward and full downward position and the seat back in its most upright position; and

(c) The template is positioned in the vertical longitudinal plane that contains the H-point of the template.

S6.2.2.1 In passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles manufactured before September 1, 2004, the portion of each user-ready tether anchorage to which a tether strap hook attaches may be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 8 to 11 of the designated seating position for which it is installed, with reference to the shoulder reference point of a template described in section 3.1 of SAE Standard J826-1992 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5), if:

(a) The H-point of the template is located-

(1) At the unique Design H-point of the designated seating position, as defined in section 2.2.11.1 of SAE Recommended Practice J1100-1993 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5), at the full downward and full rearward position of the seat, or-

(2) In the case of a designated seating position that has a means of affixing the lower portion of a child restraint system to the vehicle, other than a vehicle seat belt, midway between the two lower restraint system anchorages;

(b) The torso line of the template is at the same angle to the vertical plane as the vehicle seat back with the seat adjusted to its full rearward and full downward position and the seat back in its most upright position; and

(c) The template is positioned in the vertical longitudinal plane that contains the H-point of the template.

S6.2.2.2 The portion of a user-ready tether anchorage in a vehicle that is designed to bind with the tether strap hook may be located outside the shaded zone referred to in S6.2.2, if no part of the shaded zone is accessible without removing a seating component of the vehicle and the vehicle is equipped with a routing device that-

(a) Ensures that the tether strap functions as if the portion of the anchorage designed to bind with the tether strap hook were located within the shaded zone;

(b) Is at least 65 mm behind the torso line, in the case of a non-rigid-webbing-type routing device or a deployable routing device, or at least 100 mm behind the torso line, in the case of a fixed rigid routing device; and

(c) When tested after being installed as it is intended to be used, is of sufficient strength to withstand, with the user-ready tether anchorage, the load referred to in S6.3.4 or S6.3.4.1, as applicable.
