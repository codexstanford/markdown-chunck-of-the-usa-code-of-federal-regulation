####### Test procedure.

(b)

(1) Soak the assembly in a test environment as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(j);

(2) Attach the neck-headform assembly, as shown in Figure V2-A or V2-B in appendix A to this subpart, to the 49 CFR Part 572 pendulum test fixture (Figure 22, 49 CFR 572.33) in either the left or right lateral impact orientations, respectively, so that the midsagittal plane of the neck-headform assembly is vertical and at right angle (90 +/-1 degrees) to the plane of motion of the pendulum longitudinal centerline;

(3) Release the pendulum from a height sufficient to achieve a velocity of 5.57 +/-0.06 m/s measured at the center of the pendulum accelerometer, as shown in 49 CFR Part 572 Figure 15, at the instant the pendulum makes contact with the decelerating mechanism;

(4) The neck flexes without the neck-headform assembly making contact with any object;

(5) Time zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum mounted striker plate and the pendulum deceleration mechanism;

(6) Allow a period of at least thirty (30) minutes between successive tests on the same neck assembly.
