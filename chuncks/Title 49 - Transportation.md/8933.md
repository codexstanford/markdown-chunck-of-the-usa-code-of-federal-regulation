####### § 195.420 Valve maintenance.

(a) Each operator shall maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation of its pipeline systems in good working order at all times.

(b) Each operator must, at least twice each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 7months, inspect each valve to determine that it is functioning properly. Each rupture-mitigation valve (RMV), as defined in § 195.2, or alternative equivalent technology that is installed under § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, must also be partially operated. Operators are not required to close the valve fully during the drill; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to demonstrate compliance, unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional closure percentage for maintaining reliability.

(c) Each operator shall provide protection for each valve from unauthorized operation and from vandalism.

(d) For each remote-control valve (RCV) installed in accordance with § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, an operator must conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA system displays and the installed valves, sensors, and communications equipment, in accordance with § 195.446(c) and (e).
