####### prima facie,prima facie,prima facie,not

(e) A difference in weights at origin and destination, both of which are based on supervised scales, establishesthat the loss occurred in transit and that the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, which nevertheless, was accepted by the railroad as the basis for assessing freight charges, such unsupervised weight in combination with a supervised weight establishesthat the loss occurred in transit and the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, with the above exception, acase of railroad liability for loss in transit hasbeen established. Such difference in weights is a factor, however, to be considered in connection with other evidence that a clear-record car arrived at destination with seals intact and unbroken or that the shipper made a written complaint that any car placed for loading was defective, in response to which the railroad filed a written report after investigation of the complaint. See paragraph (c) of ยง 1037.3.
