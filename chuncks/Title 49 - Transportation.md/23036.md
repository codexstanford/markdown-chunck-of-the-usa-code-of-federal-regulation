####### Trim level

is defined to mean a subset of vehicles within the same model designation with the same body type and which are alike in their general level of standard equipment, such as a "base" trim level of a vehicle model. Vehicles with only minor trim differences that are unlikely to affect vehicle-emitted sound are not considered different for the purposes of this safety standard.
