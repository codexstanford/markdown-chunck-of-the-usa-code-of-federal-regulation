The FMCSRs incorporate "compensation" into the definition ofwhich the rules treat as "a person engaged in the transportation of goods or passengers for compensation" (§§ 390.5T and 390.5). In a notice of interpretation published on May 7, 1993, FHWA provided an expansive interpretation of "compensation," stating that compensation includes both direct and indirect payment. In addition, FHWA said certain nonbusiness organizations, including churches and charities, operate as for-hire passenger carriers when they engage in chartered operations, charging a fee (58 FR 27328, 27329). The notice clarified that certain businesses, including hotels and car rental agencies operating shuttle bus services, and outdoor recreation operations such as whitewater rafting outfits and scuba diving schools transporting patrons to or from a recreation site, constitute for-hire motor carriage of passengers. "Compensation" as used in the context of a business enterprise includes both direct and indirect payment for the transportation service provided. It need not mean "for profit."
