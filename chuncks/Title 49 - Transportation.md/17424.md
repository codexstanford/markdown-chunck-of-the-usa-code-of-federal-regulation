####### Scenario 3:

A faith-based organization sponsors a trip for its members to an amusement park in a neighboring State. The trip is announced in the organization's newsletters, but not advertised to the general public. Group members may invite friends and family, including non-members, to join. An event fee paid by all trip participants covers transportation, lodging, food, and admission to the amusement park. The organization's bus that will be used for the trip is designed to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver. The trip will extend beyond the commercial zone of the city where the organization is located.
