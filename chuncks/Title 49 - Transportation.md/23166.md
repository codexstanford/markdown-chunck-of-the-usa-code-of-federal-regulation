S8.17Determine the distance between a level surface and a standard reference point on the test vehicle's body, directly above each wheel opening, when the vehicle is in its "as delivered" condition. The "as delivered" condition is the vehicle as received at the test site, filled to 100 percent of all fluid capacities and with all tires inflated to the manufacturer's specifications listed on the vehicle's tire placard. Determine the distance between the same level surface and the same standard reference points in the vehicle's "fully loaded condition." The "fully loaded condition" is the test vehicle loaded in accordance with S8.16. The load placed in the cargo area shall be centered over the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle. The pretest vehicle attitude shall be the same as either the "as delivered" or "fully loaded" attitude or is between the "as delivered" attitude and the "fully loaded" attitude. If the test configuration requires that the vehicle be elevated off the ground, the pretest vehicle attitude must be maintained.
