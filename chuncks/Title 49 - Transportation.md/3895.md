####### ยง 172.101 Purpose and use of hazardous materials table.
######## Generic or n.o.s. descriptions.

(ii)If an appropriate technical name is not shown in the Table, selection of a proper shipping name shall be made from the generic or n.o.s. descriptions corresponding to the specific hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard, if any, for the material. The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as "Alcohol, n.o.s." rather than "Flammable liquid, n.o.s.". Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as "Coating solution" or "Extracts, flavoring, liquid", rather than by an n.o.s. entry, such as "Flammable liquid, n.o.s." It should be noted, however, that an n.o.s. description as a proper shipping name may not provide sufficient information for shipping papers and package markings. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical name of one or more constituents which makes the product a hazardous material may be required in association with the proper shipping name.
