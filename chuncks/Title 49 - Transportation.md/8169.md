######## Records.

(g)An operator must keep for the life of the pipeline records of the investigations, analyses, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section. Records must document justifications, deviations, and determinations made for the following, as applicable:

(1) The technical approach used for the analysis;

(2) All data used and analyzed;

(3) Pipe and weld properties;

(4) Procedures used;

(5) Evaluation methodology used;

(6) Models used;

(7) Direct in situ examination data;

(8) In-line inspection tool run information evaluated, including any multiple in-line inspection tool runs;

(9) Pressure test data and results;

(10) In-the-ditch assessments;

(11) All measurement tool, assessment, and evaluation accuracy specifications and tolerances used in technical and operational results;

(12) All finite element analysis results;

(13) The number of pressure cycles to failure, the equivalent number of annual pressure cycles, and the pressure cycle counting method;

(14) The predicted fatigue life and predicted failure pressure from the required fatigue life models and fracture mechanics evaluation methods;

(15) Safety factors used for fatigue life and/or predicted failure pressure calculations;

(16) Reassessment time interval and safety factors;

(17) The date of the review;

(18) Confirmation of the results by qualified technical subject matter experts; and

(19) Approval by responsible operator management personnel.
