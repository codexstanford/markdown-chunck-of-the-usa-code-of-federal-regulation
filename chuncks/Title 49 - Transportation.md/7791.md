####### ยง 192.9 What requirements apply to gathering pipelines?
######## Composite materials.

(h)Pipe and components made with composite materials not otherwise authorized for use under this part may be used on Type C gathering pipelines if the following requirements are met:

(1) Steel and plastic pipe and components must meet the installation, construction, initial inspection, and initial testing requirements in subparts B though G and J of this part applicable to transmission lines.

(2) Operators must notify PHMSA in accordance with ยง 192.18 at least 90 days prior to installing new or replacement pipe or components made of composite materials otherwise not authorized for use under this part in a Type C gathering pipeline. The notifications required by this section must include a detailed description of the pipeline facilities in which pipe or components made of composite materials would be used, including:

(i) The beginning and end points (stationing by footage and mileage with latitude and longitude coordinates) of the pipeline segment containing composite pipeline material and the counties and States in which it is located;

(ii) A general description of the right-of-way including high consequence areas, as defined in ยง 192.905;

(iii) Relevant pipeline design and construction information including the year of installation, the specific composite material, diameter, wall thickness, and any manufacturing and construction specifications for the pipeline;

(iv) Relevant operating information, including MAOP, leak and failure history, and the most recent pressure test (identification of the actual pipe tested, minimum and maximum test pressure, duration of test, any leaks and any test logs and charts) or assessment results;

(v) An explanation of the circumstances that the operator believes make the use of composite pipeline material appropriate and how the design, construction, operations, and maintenance will mitigate safety and environmental risks;

(vi) An explanation of procedures and tests that will be conducted periodically over the life of the composite pipeline material to document that its strength is being maintained;

(vii) Operations and maintenance procedures that will be applied to the alternative materials. These include procedures that will be used to evaluate and remediate anomalies and how the operator will determine safe operating pressures for composite pipe when defects are found;

(viii) An explanation of how the use of composite pipeline material would be in the public interest; and

(ix) A certification signed by a vice president (or equivalent or higher officer) of the operator's company that operation of the applicant's pipeline using composite pipeline material would be consistent with pipeline safety.

(3) Repairs or replacements using materials authorized under this part do not require notification under this section.
