####### Pressure differential test.

(2)The packaging shall be restrained while either pressure or a vacuum is applied internally. The packaging must be pressurized to the pressure required by ยง 178.604(e) of this subchapter for the appropriate packing group. The method of restraint must not affect the results of the test. The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to appropriately pressurize or evacuate the interior of the packaging and to determine if there is leakage into or out of the packaging. A packaging passes the pressure differential test if there is no change in measured internal pressure.
