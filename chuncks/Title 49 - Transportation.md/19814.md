#### PART 535 - MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY PROGRAM
##### ยง 535.7 Averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) credit program.
###### Innovative and off-cycle technology credits.

(iv)Credits can be generated by vehicle or engine families or subconfigurations having fuel consumption reductions resulting from technologies not reflected in the GEM simulation tool or in the FTP chassis dynamometer and that were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles or engines before model year 2010 that are not reflected in the specified test procedure. Manufacturers should prove that these technologies were not in common use in heavy-duty vehicles or engines before model year 2010 by demonstrating factors such as the penetration rates of the technology in the market. NHTSA will not approve any request if it determines that these technologies do not qualify. The approach for determining innovative and off-cycle technology credits under this fuel consumption program is described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section and by EPA under 40 CFR 86.1819-14(d)(13), 1036.610, and 1037.610.
