(1) Schedules consisting solely of Type 1 assignments do not have to be analyzed.

(2) Schedules containing Type 2 assignments do not have be analyzed if-

(i) The Type 2 assignment is no longer in duration than, and fully contained within, the schedule of another Type 2 assignment that has already been determined to present an acceptable level of risk for fatigue that does not violate the fatigue threshold; and

(ii) If the longer Type 2 schedule within which another Type 2 schedule is contained requires mitigations to be applied in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk for fatigue that does not violate the fatigue threshold, the same or more effective mitigations must be applied to the shorter Type 2 schedule that is fully contained within the already acceptable Type 2 schedule.
