####### Flexion.

(1)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure O1, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 77 degrees and 91 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA5572-311), about the occipital condyles may not be less than 69 N-m (51 ft-lbf) and not more than 83 N-m (61 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m (7.4 ft-lbf) between 80 ms and 100 ms after time zero.

(ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m)= M-(0.01778m) x (F).

(iii) Mis the moment about the y-axis, Fis the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), and 0.01778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
