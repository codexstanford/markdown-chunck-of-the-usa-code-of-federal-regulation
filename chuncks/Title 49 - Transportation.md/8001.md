######## Design and construction.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each new transmission line and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must have features incorporated into its design and construction to reduce the risk of internal corrosion. At a minimum, unless it is impracticable or unnecessary to do so, each new transmission line or replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must:

(1) Be configured to reduce the risk that liquids will collect in the line;

(2) Have effective liquid removal features whenever the configuration would allow liquids to collect; and

(3) Allow use of devices for monitoring internal corrosion at locations with significant potential for internal corrosion.
