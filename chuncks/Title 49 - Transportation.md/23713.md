S22.2.1.5

(a) Place any adjustable safety belt anchorages at the vehicle manufacturer's nominal design position for a 50th percentile adult male occupant.

(b) Without attaching the child restraint anchorage system components specified in S5.9 of ยง 571.213 to a vehicle child restraint anchorage system specified in ยง 571.225, align the child restraint system facing forward, such that Plane A is aligned with Plane B.

(c) While maintaining the child restraint positions achieved in S22.2.1.5(b), secure the child restraint by following, to the extent possible, the child restraint manufacturer's directions regarding proper installation of the restraint. Cinch the vehicle belts to any tension from zero up to 134 N to secure the child restraint. Measure belt tension in a flat, straight section of the lap belt between the child restraint belt path and the contact point with the belt anchor or vehicle seat, on the side away from the buckle (to avoid interference from the shoulder portion of the belt).
