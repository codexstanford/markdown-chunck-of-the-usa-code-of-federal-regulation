####### Head accelerometers.

(b)(1) Install accelerometers in the head as shown in drawing SA 106C 001 sheet 1 using suitable spacers or adaptors as needed to affix them to the horizontal transverse bulkhead so that the sensitive axes of the three accelerometers intersect at the point in the midsagittal plane located 0.4 inches below the intersection of a line connecting the longitudinal center lines of the roll pins in either side of the dummy's head with the head's midsagittal plane.

(2) The head has three orthogonally mounted accelerometers aligned as follows:

(i) Align one accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is perpendicular to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane.

(ii) Align the second accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the horizontal bulkhead, and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane.

(iii) Align the third accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane.

(iv) The seismic mass center for any of these accelerometers may be at any distance up to 0.4 inches from the axial intersection point.
