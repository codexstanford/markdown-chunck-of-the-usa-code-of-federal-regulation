(1) Printed legibly in English;

(2) Available for use away from the package containing the hazardous material; and

(3) Presented-

(i) On a shipping paper;

(ii) In a document, other than a shipping paper, that includes both the basic description and technical name of the hazardous material as required by §§ 172.202 and 172.203(k), the ICAO Technical Instructions, the IMDG Code, or the TDG Regulations, as appropriate, and the emergency response information required by this subpart (e.g., a material safety data sheet); or

(iii) Related to the information on a shipping paper, a written notification to pilot-in-command, or a dangerous cargo manifest, in a separate document (e.g., an emergency response guidance document), in a manner that cross-references the description of the hazardous material on the shipping paper with the emergency response information contained in the document. Aboard aircraft, the ICAO "Emergency Response Guidance for Aircraft Incidents Involving Dangerous Goods" and, aboard vessels, the IMO "Emergency Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods", or equivalent documents, may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section for a separate document.
