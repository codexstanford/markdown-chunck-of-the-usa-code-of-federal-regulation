####### Remanufactured locomotive

means a locomotive rebuilt or refurbished from a previously used or refurbished underframe ("deck"), containing fewer than 25% previously used components (measured by dollar value of the components). For calculation purposes, the percentage of previously used components is determined with equivalent value of new parts and is calculated using dollar values from the same year as the new parts used to remanufacture the locomotive.
