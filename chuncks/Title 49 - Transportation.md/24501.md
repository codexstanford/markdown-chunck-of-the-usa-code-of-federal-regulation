###### ยง 571.225 Standard No. 225; Child restraint anchorage systems.
####### Provisions for simultaneous and sequential testing.

S9.4.2(a) In the case of vehicle seat assemblies equipped with more than one child restraint anchorage system, the lower anchorages may, at the agency's option, be tested simultaneously. However, forces may not be applied simultaneously for any two adjacent seating positions whose midpoints are less than 400 mm apart, as measured in accordance with S9.4.2(a)(1) and (2) and Figure 20.

(1) The midpoint of the seating position lies in the vertical longitudinal plane that is equidistant from vertical longitudinal planes through the geometric center of each of the two lower anchorages at the seating position.

(2) Measure the distance between the vertical longitudinal planes passing through the midpoints of the adjacent seating positions, as measured along a line perpendicular to the planes.

(b) The lower anchorages of a particular child restraint anchorage system will not be tested if one or both of the anchorages have been previously tested under this standard.
