## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Transportation
### PART 40 - PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS
#### Subpart D - Collection Sites, Forms, Equipment and Supplies Used in DOT Urine Collections
##### ยง 40.47 May employers use the CCF for non-Federal collections or non-Federal forms for DOT collections?
###### e.g.,

(b) (1) In the rare case where the collector, either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (post-accident or reasonable suspicion test with insufficient time to obtain the CCF), uses a non-Federal form for a DOT collection, the use of a non-Federal form does not present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for an MRO to cancel the result.

(2) The use of the non-Federal form is a "correctable flaw." As an MRO, to correct the problem you must follow the procedures of ยง 40.205(b)(2).
