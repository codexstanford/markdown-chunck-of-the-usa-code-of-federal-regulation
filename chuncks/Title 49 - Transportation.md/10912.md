####### Capabilities of program logic.

(c)The program logic must have the ability to-

(1) Calculate the total time on duty for each employee, using data entered by the employee and treating each identified period as defined in ยง 228.5;

(2) Identify input errors through the use of program edits;

(3) Require records, including outstanding records, the completion of which was delayed, to be completed in chronological order;

(4) Require reconciliation when the known (system-generated) prior time off differs from the prior time off reported by an employee;

(5) Require explanation if the total time on duty reflected in the certified record exceeds the statutory maximum for the employee;

(6) Require the use of a quick tie-up process when the employee has exceeded or is within three minutes of his or her statutory maximum time on duty;

(7) Require that the employee's certified final release be not more than three minutes in the future, and that the employee may not certify a final release time for a current duty tour that is in the past, compared to the clock time of the computer system at the time that the record is certified, allowing for changes in time zones;

(8) Require automatic modification to prevent miscalculation of an employee's total time on duty for a duty tour that spans changes from and to daylight savings time;

(9) For train employees, require completion of a full record at the end of a duty tour when the employee initiates a tie-up with less than the statutory maximum time on duty and a quick tie-up is not mandated;

(10) For train employees, disallow use of a quick tie-up when the employee has time remaining to complete a full record, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

(11) Disallow any manipulation of the tie-up process that precludes compliance with any of the requirements specified by paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(10) of this section.
