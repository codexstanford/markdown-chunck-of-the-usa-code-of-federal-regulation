(4) The barrier impacts the test vehicle with the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle parallel to the line of travel and perpendicular to the barrier face within a tolerance of +/-5 degrees. The test vehicle and barrier face are aligned so that the barrier strikes the rear of the vehicle with 70 percent overlap toward either side of the vehicle. So aligned, the barrier face fully engages one half of the rear of the vehicle and partially engages the other half. At impact, the vehicle's longitudinal centerline is located inboard either of the side edges of the barrier by a distance equal to 20 percent of the vehicle's width +/-50 mm (Figure 3). The vehicle's width is the maximum dimension measured across the widest part of the vehicle, including bumpers and molding, but excluding such components as exterior mirrors, flexible mud flaps, marker lamps, and dual rear wheel configurations.
