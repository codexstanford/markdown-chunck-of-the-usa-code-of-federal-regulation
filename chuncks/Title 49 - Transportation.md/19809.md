##### ยง 535.7 Averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) credit program.
###### General provisions.

(a)After the end of each model year, manufacturers must comply with the fuel consumption standards in ยง 535.5 for averaging, banking and trading credits. Trailer manufacturers are excluded from this section except for those producing full-aero box trailers, which may comply with special provisions in paragraph (e) of this section. Manufacturers comply with standards if the sum of averaged, banked and traded credits generate a "zero" credit balance or a credit surplus within an averaging set of vehicles or engines. Manufacturers fail to comply with standards if the sum of the credit flexibilities generate a credit deficit (or shortfall) in an averaging set. Credit shortfalls must be offset by banked or traded credits within three model years after the shortfall is incurred. These processes are hereafter referenced as the NHTSA ABT credit program. The following provisions apply to all fuel consumption credits.
