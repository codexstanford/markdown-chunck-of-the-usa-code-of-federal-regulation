(i) An employee may, within 60 days of receipt of the toxicology report, request a retest of his or her PAT testing specimen. A request for retest must be emailed toThe employee's request must specify the railroad, accident date, and location. Upon receipt of the employee's request, FRA will identify and select a qualified referee laboratory that has available an appropriate, validated assay for the specimen type and analyte(s) declared positive. Because some analytes may deteriorate during storage, if the referee laboratory detects levels above its Limit of Detection (as defined in 49 CFR 40.3), FRA will report the retest result as corroborative of the original PAT test result.
