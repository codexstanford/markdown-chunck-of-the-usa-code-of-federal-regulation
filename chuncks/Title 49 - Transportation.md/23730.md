####### Test procedure for determining stages of air bag systems subject to low risk deployment (low speed crashes) test requirement.

S22.5

S22.5.1 The test described in S22.5.2 shall be conducted with an unbelted 50th percentile adult male test dummy in the driver's seating position according to S8 as it applies to that seating position and an unbelted 5th percentile adult female test dummy either in any front outboard passenger vehicle seating position according to S16 as it applies to that seating position or at any fore-aft seat position on any passenger side.

S22.5.2 Impact the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward at any speed, up to and including 26 km/h (16 mph) into a fixed rigid barrier that is perpendicular +/-5 degrees to the line of travel of the vehicle under the applicable conditions of S8, S10, and S16 excluding S10.7, S10.8, S10.9, and S16.3.5.

S22.5.3 Determine which inflation stage or combination of stages are fired and determine the time delay between successive stages. That stage or combination of stages, with time delay between successive stages, shall be used in deploying the air bag when conducting the low risk deployment tests described in S22.4, S24.4, and S26.

S22.5.4 If the air bag does not deploy in the impact described in S22.5.2, the low risk deployment tests described in S22.4, S24.4, and S26 shall be conducted with all stages using the maximum time delay between stages.
