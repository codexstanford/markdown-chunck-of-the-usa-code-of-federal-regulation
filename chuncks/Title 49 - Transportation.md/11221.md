(1) A lead locomotive originally ordered before October 1, 2006, and placed in service before October 1, 2009, including a controlling remote distributed power locomotive, a lead manned helper locomotive, a DMU locomotive, and an MU locomotive, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, shall have an in-service event recorder that records the following data elements:

(i) Train speed;

(ii) Selected direction of motion;

(iii) Time;

(iv) Distance;

(v) Throttle position;

(vi) Applications and operations of the train automatic air brake;

(vii) Applications and operations of the independent brake;

(viii) Applications and operations of the dynamic brake, if so equipped; and

(ix) Cab signal aspect(s), if so equipped and in use.

(2) A locomotive originally manufactured before October 1, 2006, and equipped with an event recorder that uses magnetic tape as its recording medium shall have the recorder removed from service on or before October 1, 2009 and replaced with an event recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of appendix D of this part and that records at least the same number of data elements as the recorder it replaces.

(3) A lead locomotive, a lead manned helper locomotive, and a controlling remotely distributed power locomotive, other than a DMU or MU locomotive, originally ordered on or after October 1, 2006 or placed in service on or after October 1, 2009, shall be equipped with an event recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of Appendix D of this part. The certified event recorder memory module shall be mounted for its maximum protection. (Although other mounting standards may meet this standard, an event recorder memory module mounted behind and below the top of the collision posts and above the platform level is deemed to be mounted "for its maximum protection.") The event recorder shall record, and the certified crashworthy event recorder memory module shall retain, the following data elements:

(i) Train speed;

(ii) Selected direction of motion;

(iii) Time;

(iv) Distance;

(v) Throttle position;
