S6.2.1The procedure shall be done in accordance with SAE Recommended Practice J578-1988 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5). When visually compared to the light emitted from a filter/source with a combination of chromaticity coordinates as explained in SAE Recommended Practice J578-1988 within specific boundaries [y = 0.33 (yellow boundary) and y = 0.98- x (purple boundary)] the color of light emitted from the test object shall not be less saturated (paler), yellower, or purpler. The test object shall be placed perpendicular to the light source to simulate lamps on stop signal arms. In making visual comparisons, the light from the test object shall light one portion of a comparison field and the light from the filter/source standard shall light an adjacent area. To make a valid visual comparison, the two fields to be viewed shall be of near equal luminance.
