####### Exception to notice requirement.

(g)The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:

(1) The Board determines that the information requested should not be disclosed; or

(2) The information already has been published or otherwise officially made available to the public; or

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or

(4) Disclosure is required by a Board rule that:

(i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;

(ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the Board that are to be released; and

(iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is submitted or within a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or

(5) The information requested was not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure, when the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the Board has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or

(6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with these regulations appears obviously frivolous; in such case, the Board must provide the submitter only with written notice of any administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.
