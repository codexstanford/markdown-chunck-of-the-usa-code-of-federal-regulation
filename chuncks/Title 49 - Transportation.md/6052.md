######## Burst testing.

(3)(i) For purposes of burst testing, each 1,000 cylinders or fewer successively produced each day constitutes a lot. All cylinders of a lot must be of identical size, construction heat treatment, finish, and quality.

(ii) One cylinder must be selected from each lot and be hydrostatically pressure tested to destruction. If this cylinder bursts below five (5) times the service pressure, then two additional cylinders from the same lot as the previously tested cylinder must be selected and subjected to this test. If either of these cylinders fails by bursting below five (5) times the service pressure then the entire lot must be rejected. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.
