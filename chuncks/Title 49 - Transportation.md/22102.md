###### ยง 571.116 Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids.
####### Summary of the procedure.

S6.13.1Brake fluid is stroked under controlled conditions at an elevated temperature in a simulated motor vehicle hydraulic braking system consisting of three slave wheel cylinders and an actuating master cylinder connected by steel tubing. Referee standard parts are used. All parts are carefully cleaned, examined, and certain measurements made immediately prior to assembly for test. During the test, temperature, rate of pressure rise, maximum pressure, and rate of stroking are specified and controlled. The system is examined periodically during stroking to assure that excessive leakage of fluid is not occurring. Afterwards, the system is torn down. Metal parts and SBR cups are examined and remeasured. The brake fluid and any resultant sludge and debris are collected, examined, and tested.
