##### ยง 583.6 Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content.
###### ii

() The value of materials used to produce a product in the earliest of these two substantial transformation stages shall be treated as value added in the country in which that stage occurred.

(B) For any material used by the supplier which was imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that material (determined according to the principles set forth in (A), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is counted.

(iii) Allied suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment shall determine the value that is added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials in the equipment in accordance with (c)(3).

(iv) For the minor items listed in the ยง 583.4 definition of "passenger motor vehicle equipment" as being excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.

(v) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that equipment (determined according to the principles set forth in the rest of (c)(4)), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is counted.

(vi) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States and/or Canada.

(5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered zero. This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information from their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.

(6) If a manufacturer or allied supplier requests information in a timely manner from one or more of its outside suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, but does not receive that information despite a good faith effort to obtain it, the manufacturer or allied supplier may make its own good faith value added determinations, subject to the following provisions:

(i) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall make the same value added determinations as would be made by the outside supplier;

(ii) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall consider the amount of value added and the location in which the value was added for all of the stages that the outside supplier would be required to consider;

(iii) The manufacturer or allied supplier may determine that particular value is added in the United States and/or Canada only if it has a good faith basis to make that determination;

(iv) A manufacturer and its allied suppliers may, on a combined basis, make value added determinations for no more than 10 percent, by value, of a carline's total parts content from outside suppliers;

(v) Value added determinations made by a manufacturer or allied supplier under this paragraph shall have the same effect as if they were made by the outside supplier;

(vi) This provision does not affect the obligation of outside suppliers to provide the requested information.
