####### ยง 192.634 Transmission lines: Onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.
######## Shut-off segment.

(1)For purposes of this section, a "shut-off segment" means the segment of pipe located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the new or replaced Class 3 or Class 4 or HCA pipeline segment and the downstream valve closest to the downstream endpoint of the new or replaced Class 3 or Class 4 or HCA pipeline segment so that the entirety of the segment that is within the HCA or the Class 3 or Class 4 location is between at least two RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. If any crossover or lateral pipe for gas receipts or deliveries connects to the shut-off segment between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off segment also must extend to a valve on the crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for gas to be transported to the rupture site (except for residual gas already in the shut-off segment). Multiple Class 3 or Class 4 locations or HCA segments may be contained within a single shut-off segment. The operator is not required to select the closest valve to the shut-off segment as the RMV, as that term is defined in ยง 192.3, or the alternative equivalent technology. An operator may use a manual compressor station valve at a continuously manned station as an alternative equivalent technology, but it must be able to be closed within 30 minutes following rupture identification, as that term is defined at ยง 192.3. Such a valve used as an alternative equivalent technology would not require a notification to PHMSA in accordance with ยง 192.18.
