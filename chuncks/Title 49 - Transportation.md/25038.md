###### ยง 572.125 Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.
####### Upper/lower torso assembly.

(a)The test objective is to determine the stiffness effects of the lumbar spine (drawing 127-3002), including cable (drawing 127-8095), mounting plate insert (drawing 910420-048), nylon shoulder bushing (drawing 9001373), nut (drawing 9001336), and abdominal insert (drawing 127-8210), on resistance to articulation between upper torso assembly (drawing 127-2000) and lower torso assembly (drawing 127-3000).

(b)(1) When the upper torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the head to neck pivot pin level through a rigidly attached adaptor bracket as shown in Figure N5 according to the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper torso assembly to translate in angular motion until the machined rear surface of the instrument cavity at the back of the thoracic spine box is at 45 +/-0.5 degrees relative to the vertical transverse plane, at which time the force applied as shown in Figure N5 must be not less than 147 N (33 lbf) and not more than 200 N (45 lbf), and

(2) Upon removal of the force, the torso assembly must return to within 8 degrees of its initial position.
