####### Performance Criteria.

(c)

(1) The pendulum deceleration pulse is characterized in terms of decrease in velocity as obtained by integrating the pendulum acceleration output from time zero:

(2) The maximum translation-rotation of the midsagittal plane of the headform disk (180-9061 or 9062) in the lateral direction measured, with the rotation transducers specified in 49 CFR 572.200(e) shall be 71 to 81 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis of the pendulum (see Figure V2-C in appendix A to this subpart) occurring between 50 and 70 ms from time zero;

(3) Peak occipital condyle moment shall not be higher than -36 Nm and not lower than -44 Nm. The moment measured by the upper neck load cell (Mx) shall be adjusted by the following formula: Mx(oc)= Mx + 0.01778Fy;

(4) The decaying moment shall cross the 0 Nm line after peak moment between 102 ms-126 ms after time zero.
