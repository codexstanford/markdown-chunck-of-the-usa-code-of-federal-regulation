(e)-(1)It is preferable that the fuel economy and environment label information be incorporated into the Monroney label, provided that the prominence and legibility of the fuel economy and environment label is maintained. If the fuel economy and environment label is incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be placed on a separate section in the Monroney label and must not be intermixed with that label information, except for vehicle descriptions as noted in 40 CFR 600.302-08(d)(1). If the fuel economy and environment label is not incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be located on a side window, and as close as possible to the Monroney label. If the window is not large enough to accommodate both the Monroney label and the fuel economy and environment label, the latter must be located on another window as close as physically possible to the Monroney label.
