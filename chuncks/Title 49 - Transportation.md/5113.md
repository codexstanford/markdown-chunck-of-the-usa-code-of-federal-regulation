(d)(1) As an alternative to the authorized tank car specification noted in the column 4 of the table in paragraph (c) of this section, a car of the same authorized tank car specification but of the next lower test pressure, as prescribed in column 5 of the table at ยง 179.101-1, may be used provided both of the following conditions are met:

(i) The difference between the alternative and the required minimum plate thicknesses, based on the calculation prescribed in ยง 179.100-6 of this subchapter, is added to the alternative tank car jacket and head shield. When the jacket and head shield are made from any authorized steel with a minimum tensile strength from 70,000 p.s.i. to 80,000 p.s.i., but the required minimum plate thickness calculation is based on steel with a minimum tensile strength of 81,000 p.s.i., the thickness to be added to the jacket and head shield must be increased by a factor of 1.157. Forming allowances for heads are not required to be considered when calculating thickness differences as prescribed in this paragraph.

(ii) The tank car jacket and head shield must be manufactured from carbon steel plate as prescribed in ยง 179.100-7(a) of this subchapter.
