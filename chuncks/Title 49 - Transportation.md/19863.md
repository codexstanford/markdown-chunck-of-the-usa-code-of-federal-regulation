###### End of the Year (EOY) and Final reports.

(d)Heavy-duty vehicle and engine manufacturers participating in the ABT program are required to submit EOY and final reports containing information for NHTSA as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and in accordance with 40 CFR 86.1865, 1036.730, and 1037.730. Only manufacturers without credit deficits may decide not to participate in the ABT or may waive the requirement to send an EOY report. The EOY and final reports are used to review a manufacturer's preliminary or final compliance information and to identify manufacturers that might have a credit deficit for the given model year. For model years 2013 and later, heavy-duty vehicle and engine manufacturers complying with NHTSA's voluntary and mandatory standards must submit EOY and final reports through the EPA database including both GHG emissions and fuel consumption information for each given model year.
