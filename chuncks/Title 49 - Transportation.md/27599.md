The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the application.

The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
