(b)At a minimum, each railroad shall keep the records described in paragraph (a) of this section for one periodic maintenance interval for each specific type of equipment as described in the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance plan required by ยง 238.107. FRA strongly encourages railroads to keep these records for longer periods of time because they form the basis for future reliability-based decisions concerning test and maintenance intervals that may be developed pursuant to ยง 238.307(b).
