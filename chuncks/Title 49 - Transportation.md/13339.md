####### Automated tracking system.

(5)Automated tracking systems used to meet the tagging requirements contained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may prohibit or revoke a railroad's ability to utilize an automated tracking system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the automated tracking system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA or a railroad's employees, or fails to adequately track or monitor the movement of defective equipment. Such a determination will be made in writing and will state the basis for such action.

(6) After a qualified maintenance person or a qualified person verifies that the defective equipment is safe to remain in service as required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the defective equipment that develops a condition not in compliance with this part while en route may continue in passenger service not later than the next calendar day mechanical inspection, if the requirements of this paragraph are otherwise fully met.
