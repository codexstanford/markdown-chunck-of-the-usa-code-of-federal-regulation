##### 8. Boarding Separately From Wheelchair.

A wheelchair user's request to board a fixed route or paratransit vehicle separately from his or her device when the occupied weight of the device exceeds the design load of the vehicle lift should generally be granted. (Note, however, that under ยง 37.165(b), entities are required to accommodate device/user loads and dimensions that exceed the former "common wheelchair" standard, as long as the vehicle and lift will accommodate them.)
