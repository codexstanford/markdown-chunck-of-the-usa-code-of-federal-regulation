######## MC 306, MC 307, MC 312 cargo tanks.

(f)Either a Registered Inspector or a Design Certifying Engineer and the owner of a MC 306, MC 307 or MC 312 cargo tank motor vehicle constructed in accordance with and used under an exemption issued before December 31, 1990, that authorizes a condition specified in this paragraph shall examine the cargo tank motor vehicle and its design to determine if it meets the requirements of the applicable MC 306, MC 307 or MC 312 specification in effect at the time of manufacture, except as specified herein.

(1) A cargo tank motor vehicle constructed after August 1, 1981, or the date specified in the applicable exemption, in conformance with the following conditions that apply, may be remarked and certified in accordance with paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section:

(i) A vacuum-loaded cargo tank must have an ASME Code stamped specification plate marked with a minimum internal design pressure of 25 psig, and be designed for a minimum external design pressure of 15 psig.

(ii) An outlet equipped with a self-closing system which includes an external stop-valve must have the stop valve and associated piping protected within the vehicle's rear-end tank protection device, vehicle frame or an equally adequate accident damage protection device (See § 178.345-8 of this subchapter.) The self-closing system (See § 178.345-11 of this subchapter) must be equipped with a remotely actuated means of closure as follows:

(A) For a cargo tank used in other than corrosive service, the remote means of closure must be activated for closure by manual or mechanical means and, in case of fire, by an automatic heat activated means.

(B) For a cargo tank used in corrosive service, the remote means of closure may be actuated by manual or mechanical means only.

(iii) A cargo tank having an unreinforced portion of the shell exceeding 60 inches must have the circumferential reinforcement located so that the thickness and tensile strength of shell material in combination with the frame and circumferential reinforcement produces a structural integrity at least equal to that prescribed in § 178.345-3 of this subchapter or the specification in effect at time of manufacture.

(iv) A cargo tank having a projection from the tank shell or head that may contain lading in any tank position is authorized, provided such projection is as strong as the tank shell or head and is located within the motor vehicle's rear-end tank protection or other appropriate accident damage protection device.

(v) A cargo tank may be constructed of nickel, titanium, or other ASME sheet or plate materials in accordance with an exemption.

(2) A vacuum-loaded cargo tank constructed after August 1, 1981, or the date specified in the applicable exemption, in conformance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, except that an outlet equipped with an external valve which is not part of a self-closing system:

(i) Must be equipped with a self-closing system prior to September 1, 1993.

(ii) May be remarked and certified in accordance with paragraphs (f)(5) and (6) of this section after the cargo tank motor vehicle has been equipped with the self-closing system.

(3) A vacuum-loaded cargo tank constructed prior to August 1, 1981, in conformance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, except for paragraph (f)(1)(i), may be remarked and certified in accordance with paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section.

(4) A vacuum-loaded cargo tank constructed prior to August 1, 1981, in conformance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, except for paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, and except that an outlet is equipped with an external valve which is not part of a self-closing system:

(i) Must be equipped with a self-closing system prior to September 1, 1993.

(ii) May be remarked and certified in accordance with paragraphs (f)(5) and (6) of this section after the cargo tank motor vehicle has been equipped with the self-closing system.

(5) The owner of a cargo tank for which a determination has been made that the cargo tank is in conformance with paragraph (f) (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section shall complete a written certification, in English, signed by the owner and containing at least the following information:

(i) A statement certifying that each cargo tank conforms to § 180.405 (f) (1), (2), (3), or (4);

(ii) The applicable DOT exemption number, the applicable specification number and the owner's and manufacturer's serial number for the cargo tank;

(iii) A statement setting forth any modifications made to bring the cargo tank into conformance with § 180.405(f) (1), (2), (3), or (4), or the applicable specification;

(iv) A statement identifying the person certifying the cargo tank and the date of certification.

(6) The owner of a certified cargo tank shall remove the exemption number stenciled on the cargo tank and shall durably mark the specification plate (or a plate placed adjacent to the specification plate) "MC + + + -E ****####" (where " + + + " is to be replaced by the applicable specification number, "* * * *" by the exemption number and "# # # #" by the alloy.)

(7) A cargo tank remarked and certified in conformance with this paragraph (f) is excepted from the provisions of § 180.405(c).

(8) During the period the cargo tank is in service, and for one year thereafter, the owner of a cargo tank that is certified and remarked in this manner must retain on file at its principal place of business a copy of the certificate and the last exemption in effect.
