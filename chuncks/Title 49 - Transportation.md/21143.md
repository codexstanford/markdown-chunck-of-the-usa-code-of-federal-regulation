S7.3.12

S7.3.12.1 When a taillamp is combined with a stop lamp, the luminous intensity of the stop lamp at each identified test point must not be less than the luminous intensity of the taillamp at that same test point times the multiplier shown for that test point in Table IX.

S7.3.12.2 If a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used on a passenger car or on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or trailer of less than 2032 mm in overall width, and the distance between the optical axes for both the taillamp and stop lamp is within 560 mm for two compartment or lamp arrangements or 410 mm for three compartment or lamp arrangements, then the ratio must be computed with all compartments or lamps lighted.

S7.3.12.3 If a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used and the distance between optical axes for one of the functions exceeds 560 mm for two compartment or lamp arrangements or 410 mm for three compartments or lamp arrangements, then the ratio must be computed for only those compartments or lamps where the taillamp and stop lamp are optically combined.

S7.3.12.4 Where the taillamp is combined with the stop lamp, and the maximum luminous intensity of the taillamp is located below horizontal and within an area generated by a 0.5 &#xB0; radius around a test point for a taillamp on a passenger car or on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or trailer of less than 2032 mm in overall width, or by a 1.0 &#xB0; radius around a test point for a taillamp on a vehicle 2032 mm or more in overall width, the ratio for the test point may be computed using the lowest value of the taillamp luminous intensity within the generated area.
