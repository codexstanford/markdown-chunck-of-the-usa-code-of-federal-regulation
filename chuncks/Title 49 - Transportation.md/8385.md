####### Reference half cells.

IV.A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell contacting the electrolyte.

B. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the saturated cooper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference half cells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to -0.85 volt as referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell:

(1) Saturated KCl calomel half cell: -0.78 volt.

(2) Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: -0.80 volt.

C. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate metallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured and if its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell is established.
