##### Appendix B to Part 227 - Methods for Estimating the Adequacy of Hearing Protector Attenuation

This appendix is mandatory.

Employers must select one of the following three methods by which to estimate the adequacy of hearing protector attenuation.

Derate the hearing protector attenuation by type using the following requirements:

A. Subtract 7 dB from the published Noise Reduction Rating (NRR).

B. Reduce the resulting amount by:

1. 20% for earmuffs,

2. 40% for form-able earplugs, or

3. 60% for all other earplugs.

C. Subtract the remaining amount from the A-weighted TWA. You will have the estimated A-weighted TWA for that hearing protector.
