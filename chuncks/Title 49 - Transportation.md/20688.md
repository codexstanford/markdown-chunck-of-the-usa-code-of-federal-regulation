####### Transmission selector control.

S6.4For S7.3, S7.5, S7.8, S7.15, S7.17, S7.11.1.2, S7.11.2.2, S7.11.3.2, and as required for S7.13, the transmission selector control is in neutral for all decelerations. For all other tests during all decelerations, the transmission selector is in the control position, other than overdrive, recommended by the manufacturer for driving on a level surface at the applicable test speed. To avoid engine stall during tests required to be run in gear a manual transmission may be shifted to neutral (or the clutch disengaged) when the vehicle speed decreases to 20 mph.
