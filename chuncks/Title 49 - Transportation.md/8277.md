####### ยง 192.927 What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA)?
######## Identification of locations for excavation and direct examination.

(3)An operator's plan must identify the locations where internal corrosion is most likely in each ICDA region. In the location identification process, an operator must identify a minimum of two locations for excavation within each ICDA Region within a covered segment and must perform a direct examination for internal corrosion at each location, using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or other generally accepted measurement technique. One location must be the low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA Region. The second location must be further downstream, within a covered segment, near the end of the ICDA Region. If corrosion exists at either location, the operator must-

(i) Evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and remediate the defect in accordance with ยง 192.933;

(ii) As part of the operator's current integrity assessment either perform additional excavations in each covered segment within the ICDA region, or use an alternative assessment method allowed by this subpart to assess the line pipe in each covered segment within the ICDA region for internal corrosion; and

(iii) Evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline system with similar characteristics to the ICDA region containing the covered segment in which the corrosion was found, and as appropriate, remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with ยง 192.933.
