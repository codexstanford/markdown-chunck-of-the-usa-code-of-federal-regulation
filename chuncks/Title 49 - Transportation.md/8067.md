######## Rupture post-failure and incident summary.

(d)If a failure or incident on an onshore gas transmission pipeline or a Type A gathering pipeline involves the identification of a rupture following a notification of potential rupture, or the closure of an RMV (as those terms are defined in ยง 192.3), or the closure of an alternative equivalent technology, the operator of the pipeline must complete a summary of the post-failure or incident review required by paragraph (c) of this section within 90 days of the incident, and while the investigation is pending, conduct quarterly status reviews until the investigation is complete and a final post-incident summary is prepared. The final post-failure or incident summary, and all other reviews and analyses produced under the requirements of this section, must be reviewed, dated, and signed by the operator's appropriate senior executive officer. The final post-failure or incident summary, all investigation and analysis documents used to prepare it, and records of lessons learned must be kept for the useful life of the pipeline. The requirements of this paragraph (d) are not applicable to distribution pipelines or Types B and C gas gathering pipelines.
