######## Porous filling.

(p)(1) Cylinders must be filled with a porous material in accordance with the following:

(i) The porous material may not disintegrate or sag when wet with solvent or when subjected to normal service;

(ii) The filling material must be uniform in quality and free of voids, except that a well drilled into the filling material beneath the valve is authorized if the well is filled with a material of such type that the functions of the filling material are not impaired;

(iii) Overall shrinkage of the filling material is authorized if the total clearance between the cylinder shell and filling material, after solvent has been added, does not exceedof 1 percent of the respective diameter or length but not to exceedinch, measured diametrically and longitudinally;

(iv) The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling material;

(v) The installed filling material must meet the requirements of CGA C-12 (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter); and

(vi) Porosity of filling material may not exceed 80 percent except that filling material with a porosity of up to 92 percent may be used when tested with satisfactory results in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-12.

(2) When the porosity of each cylinder is not known, a cylinder taken at random from a lot of 200 or less must be tested for porosity. If the test cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be tested individually and those cylinders that pass the test are acceptable.

(3) For filling that is molded and dried before insertion in cylinders, porosity test may be made on sample block taken at random from material to be used.

(4) The porosity of the filling material must be determined; the amount of solvent at 70 &#xB0;F for a cylinder:

(i) Having shell volumetric capacity above 20 pounds water capacity (nominal) may not exceed the following:

(ii) Having volumetric capacity of 20 pounds or less water capacity (nominal), may not exceed the following:
