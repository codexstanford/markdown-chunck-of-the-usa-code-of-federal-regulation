##### Gifts, entertainment, and favors.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an employee may not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, food, lodging, loan, or other thing of monetary value, from a person or employer of a person who:

(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relationships with the Association.

(2) Has interests which may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of that employee's official duties.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may:

(1) Accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value when the circumstances make it clear that an obvious family relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned is the motivating factor;

(2) Accept food or refreshment of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour if the employee is properly in attendance;

(3) Accept unsolicited advertising or promotional material such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, or other items of nominal intrinsic value; or

(4) Accept an invitation addressed to the Association, when approved by the General Counsel, to participate in an inaugural trip or similar ceremonial event related to transportation, and accept food, lodging, and entertainment incident thereto.

(c) An employee may not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself. However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or a donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, retirement, or transfer.
