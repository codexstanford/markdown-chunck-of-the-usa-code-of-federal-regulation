## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Transportation
### PART 99 - EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CONDUCT
#### Appendix E to Part 99 - Statutes Regulating Post-Employment Responsibilities of Government and Special Government Employees
##### New 18 U.S.C. 208.

This section forbids certain actions by an officer or employee of the Government in his role as a servant or representative of the Government. Its thrust is therefore to be distinguished from that of sections 203 and 205 which forbid certain actions in his capacity as a representative of persons outside the Government.

Subsection (a) in substance requires an officer or employee of the executive branch, an independent agency or the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, to refrain from participating as such in any matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child or partner has a financial interest. He must also remove himself from a matter in which a business or nonprofit organization with which he is connected or is seeking employment has a financial interest.
