S14.6.6.2

S14.6.6.2.1 Tests are made with all filaments lighted at design voltage that are intended to be used simultaneously in the headlamp and which in combination draw the highest total wattage. These include but are not limited to filaments used for turn signal lamps, fog lamps, parking lamps, and headlamp lower beams lighted with upper beams when the wiring harness is so connected on the vehicle.

S14.6.6.2.2 If a turn signal is included in the headlamp assembly, it is operated at 90 flashes a minute with a 75% +/-2% current "on time."

S14.6.6.2.3 If the lamp produces both the upper and lower beam, it is tested in both the upper beam mode and the lower beam mode under the conditions above described, except for a headlamp with a single type HB1 or type HB2 light source.
