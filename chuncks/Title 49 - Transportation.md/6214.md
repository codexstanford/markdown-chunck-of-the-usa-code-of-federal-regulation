(1)A specimen must be removed from the cylinder used for the mechanical tests specified in paragraph (j) of this section. The specimen must be taken from across the seam; edges must be parallel for a distance of approximately 2 inches on either side of the weld. The specimen must be fractured in tension. The actual breaking stress must be a minimum of 30,000 psi. The apparent breaking stress calculated on the minimum design wall thickness must be a minimum of two (2) times the stress calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the specimen fails to meet the requirements, the lot must be rejected except that specimens may be taken from two (2) additional cylinders from the same lot as the previously tested specimens. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
