######## Pressure testing.,Lot testing.

(i)Each cylinder must successfully withstand a pressure test as follows: (1)(i) At least one (1) cylinder randomly selected out of each lot of 200 or fewer must be tested by the water jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR; see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

(ii) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of 2 times service pressure.

(iii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

(iv) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
