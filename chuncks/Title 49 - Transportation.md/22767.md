####### Vehicle weight.

S6.3.1.

S6.3.1.1. For the tests at GVWR, the vehicle is loaded to its GVWR such that the weight on each axle as measured at the tire-ground interface is in proportion to its GAWR, with the fuel tank filled to 100% of capacity. However, if the weight on any axle of a vehicle at LLVW exceeds the axle's proportional share of the GVWR, the load required to reach GVWR is placed so that the weight on that axle remains the same as at LLVW.

S6.3.1.2. For the test at LLVW, the vehicle is loaded to its LLVW such that the added weight is distributed in the front passenger seat area.
