######## § 390.113 Reasons for removal from the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners.

FMCSA may remove a medical examiner from the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners when a medical examiner fails to meet or maintain the qualifications established by §§ 390.103 through 390.115, the requirements of other regulations applicable to the medical examiner, or otherwise does not meet the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 31149.
