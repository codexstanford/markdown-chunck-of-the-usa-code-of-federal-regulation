####### Rear outboard designated seating position

(b)means any "outboard designated seating position" (as that term is defined at 49 CFR 571.3) that is rearward of the front seat(s), except any designated seating positions adjacent to a walkway located between the seat and the side of the vehicle, which walkway is designed to allow access to more rearward seating positions.

S4.2.4.2 Any rear outboard designated seating position with a seat that can be adjusted to be forward-facing and to face some other direction shall either:

(i) Meet the requirements of S4.2.4 with the seat in any position in which it can be occupied while the vehicle is in motion; or

(ii) When the seat is in its forward-facing position, have a Type 2 seat belt assembly with an upper torso restraint that conforms to S7.1 and S7.2 of this standard and that adjusts by means of an emergency locking retractor that conforms with Standard No. 209 (49 CFR 571.209), which upper torso restraint may be detachable at the buckle, and, when the seat is in any position in which it can be occupied while the vehicle is in motion, have a Type 1 seat belt or the pelvic portion of a Type 2 seat belt assembly that conforms to S7.1 and S7.2 of this standard.

S4.2.4.3 Any rear outboard designated seating position on a readily removable seat (that is, a seat designed to be easily removed and replaced by means installed by the manufacturer for that purpose) in a vehicle manufactured on or after September 1, 1992 shall meet the requirements of S4.2.4 and may use an upper torso belt that detaches at either its upper or lower anchorage point, but not both anchorage points, to meet those requirements. The means for detaching the upper torso belt may use a pushbutton action.
