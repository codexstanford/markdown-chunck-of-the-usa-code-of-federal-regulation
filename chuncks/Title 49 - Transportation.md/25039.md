####### Test procedure.

(c)The test procedure for the torso assemblies is as follows:

(1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 &#xB0;C (66 and 78 &#xB0;F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.

(2) Attach the dummy (with or without the legs below the femurs) to the fixture in a seated posture as shown in Figure N5.

(3) Secure the pelvis at the pelvis instrument cavity rear face by threading fourin cap screws into the available threaded attachment holes. Tighten the mountings so that the test material is rigidly affixed to the test fixture and the pelvic-lumbar joining surface is horizontal.

(4) Flex the thorax forward three times between vertical and until the torso reference plane, as shown in figure N5, reaches 30 +/-2 degrees from vertical. Bring the torso to vertical orientation, remove all externally applied flexion forces, and wait 30 minutes before conducting the test. During the 30-minute waiting period, the dummy's upper torso shall be externally supported at or near its vertical orientation to prevent sagging.

(5) Remove the external support and wait two minutes. Measure the initial orientation of the torso reference plane of the seated, unsupported dummy as shown in Figure N5. This initial torso orientation angle may not exceed 22 degrees.

(6) Attach the loading adapter bracket to the spine of the dummy, the pull cable, and the load cell as shown in Figure N5.

(7) Apply a tension force in the midsagittal plane to the pull cable as shown in Figure N5 at any upper torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second, until the torso reference plane is at 45 +/-0.5 degrees of flexion relative to the vertical transverse plane as shown in Figure N5.

(8) Continue to apply a force sufficient to maintain 45 +/-0.5 degrees of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during the 10-second period.

(9) Release all force as rapidly as possible, and measure the return angle at 3 minutes or any time thereafter after the release.
