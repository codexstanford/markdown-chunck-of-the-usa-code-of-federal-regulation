### PART 40 - PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS
#### Subpart L - Alcohol Screening Tests
##### ยง 40.247 What procedures does the BAT or STT follow after a screening test result?
###### i.e.,

(ii) Tell the employee the reason for the waiting period required by ยง 40.251(a) (to prevent an accumulation of mouth alcohol from leading to an artificially high reading);

(iii) Explain that following your instructions concerning the waiting period is to the employee's benefit;

(iv) Explain that the confirmation test will be conducted at the end of the waiting period, even if the instructions have not been followed;

(v) Note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF that the waiting period instructions were provided;

(vi) Instruct the person accompanying the employee to carry a copy of the ATF to the BAT who will perform the confirmation test; and

(vii) Ensure that you or another BAT, STT, or employer representative observe the employee as he or she is transported to the confirmation testing site. You must direct the employee not to attempt to drive a motor vehicle to the confirmation testing site.

(c) If the screening test is invalid, you must, as the BAT or STT, tell the employee the test is cancelled and note the problem on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. If practicable, repeat the testing process (see ยง 40.271).
