####### Marking and instructions.

(3)Each manual override device and each retention mechanism shall be marked, and instructions provided for their use, as specified in ยง 299.423.

(f) The status of each powered, exterior side door in a passenger car shall be displayed to the driver in the operating cab. Door interlock sensors shall be provided to detect trainset motion and shall be nominally set to operate at 5 km/h.

(g) All powered exterior side passenger doors shall-

(1) Be equipped with the service-proven door safety system utilized by the N700 or an alternate door safety system designed subject to a Failure Modes, Effects, Criticality Analysis (FMECA);

(2) Be designed with an obstruction detection system capable of detecting a rigid flat bar, 6.4 mm (inches) wide and 76 mm (3 inches) high and a rigid rod, 9.5 mm (inches) in diameter;

(3) Incorporate an obstruction detection system sufficient to detect large obstructions;

(4) Be designed so that activation of a door by-pass feature does not affect the operation of the obstruction detection system on all the other doors on the trainset;

(5) Have the door control station located in a secured area that is only accessible to crewmembers or maintenance personnel;

(6) Be designed such that the door open or closed circuit is not affected by the throttle position; and

(7) Use discrete, dedicated trainlines for door-open and door-close commands, door-closed summary circuit, and no motion, if trainlined.

(h) All powered exterior side door systems in a trainset shall-

(1) Be designed with a door summary circuit. The door summary circuit shall be connected or interlocked to prohibit the trainset from developing tractive power if an exterior side door in a passenger car, other than a door under the direct physical control of a crewmember for his or her exclusive use, is not closed;

(2) Be connected to side door status indicators located on the exterior of each unit of the trainset;

(3) Be connected to a door summary status indicator that is readily viewable to the driver from his or her normal position in the operating cab;

(4) If equipped with a trainset-wide door by-pass device, be designed so that the trainset-wide door by-pass functions only when activated from the operating cab of the trainset;

(5) Be equipped with a lock (cut-out/lock-out) mechanism installed at each door panel to secure a door in the closed and locked position. When the lock mechanism is utilized to secure the door in the closed position, a door-closed indication shall be provided to the door summary circuit; and

(6) Be designed such that a crew key or other secure device be required to lock-out an exterior side door to prevent unauthorized use.
