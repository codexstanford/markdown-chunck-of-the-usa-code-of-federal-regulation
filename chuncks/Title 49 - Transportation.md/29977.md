(a)The ALJ may issue an initial decision after the conclusion of the hearing or after the submission of written posthearing briefs, if so ordered. In each oral or written decision, the ALJ must include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the ALJ's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by the ALJ, and a discussion of the basis for any order issued in the proceedings. The ALJ is not required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the substance of the initial decision. If the ALJ refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the ALJ must make copies of that initial decision available to all parties and the TSA decision maker.
