######## Wall thickness; wall stress.

(g)The wall thickness/wall stress of the cylinder must conform to the following:

(1) The calculated wall stress at 750 psi may not exceed 35,000 psi, or one-half of the minimum ultimate strength of the steel as determined in paragraph (l) of this section, whichever value is the smaller. The measured wall thickness may not include galvanizing or other protective coating.

(i) Calculation of wall stress must be made by the formula:

(ii) Either D or d must be calculated from the relation D = d + 2t, where t = minimum wall thickness.

(2) Cylinders with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch, the ratio of straight side wall length to outside diameter may not exceed 3.5.

(3) For cylinders having outside diameter over 5 inches, the minimum wall thickness must be 0.087 inch.
