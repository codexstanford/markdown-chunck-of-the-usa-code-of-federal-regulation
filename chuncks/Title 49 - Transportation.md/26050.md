###### ยง 587.15 Verification of aluminum honeycomb crush strength.
####### Sample locations.

(a)To ensure uniformity of crush strength across the whole of the deformable face, 8 samples are taken from 4 locations evenly spaced across the honeycomb material. Seven of these 8 samples must meet the crush strength requirements when tested in accordance with the following sections. The location of the samples depends on the size of the honeycomb material being tested. Four samples, each measuring 300 mm (11.8 in) x 300 mm (11.8 in) x 25 mm (1 in) thick are cut from the honeycomb material. (See Figure 2 for how to locate these samples on two different sizes of honeycomb material.) Each of these larger samples is cut into samples of the size specified in ยง 587.15(b). Verification is based on the testing of two samples from each of the four locations. The other two samples are retained for future verification, if necessary.
