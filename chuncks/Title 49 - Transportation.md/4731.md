######## Protection against inadvertent actuation.

(c)A chemical oxygen generator must incorporate one of the following means of preventing inadvertent actuation:

(1) A chemical oxygen generator that is not installed in protective breathing equipment (PBE):

(i) Mechanically actuated devices:

(A) Two pins, installed so that each is independently capable of preventing the actuator from striking the primer;

(B) One pin and one retaining ring, each installed so that each is independently capable of preventing the actuator from striking the primer; or

(C) A cover securely installed over the primer and a pin installed so as to prevent the actuator from striking the primer and cover.

(ii) Electrically actuated devices: The electrical leads must be mechanically shorted and the mechanical short must be shielded in metal foil.

(iii) Devices with a primer but no actuator: A chemical oxygen generator that has a primer but no actuating mechanism must have a protective cover over the primer to prevent actuation from external impact.

(2) A chemical oxygen generator installed in a PBE must contain a pin installed so as to prevent the actuator from striking the primer, and be placed in a protective bag, pouch, case or cover such that the protective breathing equipment is fully enclosed in such a manner that the protective bag, pouch, case or cover prevents unintentional actuation of the oxygen generator.
