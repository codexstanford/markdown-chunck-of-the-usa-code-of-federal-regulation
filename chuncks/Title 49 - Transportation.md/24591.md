####### Static deflection.

S7.2The ejection impactor targeting point must not deflect more than 20 mm in the x-z plane when a 981 N +/-5 N force is applied in a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane, through the y axis of the headform and no more than 5 mm rear of the posterior surface of the headform. The force is applied once in each of the following headform axes: + z, -z, + x, -x. The static deflection measurement is made with the ejection impactor extended 400 mm outboard of the theoretical point of impact with the countermeasure and attached to the ejection propulsion mechanism, including any support frame and anchors.
