(2) Each inner receptacle with a removable closure has its closure held securely in place with wire, tape, or other positive means;

(3) Unless equivalent cushioning and absorbent material surrounds the inside packaging, each inner receptacle is securely packed in an inside packaging with cushioning and absorbent material that:

(i) Will not react chemically with the material, and

(ii) Is capable of absorbing the entire contents (if a liquid) of the receptacle;

(4) The inside packaging is securely packed in a strong outer packaging;

(5) The completed package is capable of sustaining-

(ii) Placed in vials or other rigid containers with no more than 30 mL of alcohol or alcohol solution. The containers are placed in a plastic bag that is heat-sealed;

(2) The bagged specimens are placed in another plastic bag with sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire liquid contents inside the primary receptacle. The outer plastic bag is then heat-sealed;

(3) The completed bag is placed in a strong outer packaging with sufficient cushioning material that conforms to subpart B of part 173;

(4) The aggregate net quantity of flammable liquid in one outer packaging may not exceed 1 L; and
