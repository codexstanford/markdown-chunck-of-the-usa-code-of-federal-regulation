####### Test procedure.

(b)(1) Soak the neck-headform assembly in a test environment as specified in ยง 572.189(n);

(2) Attach the neck-headform assembly to the part 572 subpart E pendulum test fixture as shown in Figure U2-A in appendix A to this subpart, so that the midsagittal plane of the neck-headform assembly is vertical and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the pendulum longitudinal centerline shown in Figure U2-A. Torque the half-spherical screws (175-2004) located at either end of the neck assembly to 88 +/-5 in-lbs using the neck compression tool (175-9500) or equivalent;

(3) Release the pendulum from a height sufficient to allow it to fall freely to achieve an impact velocity of 3.4+/-0.1 m/s measured at the center of the pendulum accelerometer (Figure 22 as set forth in 49 CFR 572.33) at the time the pendulum makes contact with the decelerating mechanism. The velocity-time history of the pendulum falls inside the corridor determined by the upper and lower boundaries specified in Table 1 to paragraph (a) of this section.

(4) Allow the neck to flex without the neck-headform assembly making contact with any object;

(5) Time zero is defined in ยง 572.189(j).
