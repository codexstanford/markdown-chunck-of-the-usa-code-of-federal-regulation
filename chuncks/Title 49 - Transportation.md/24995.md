####### Limbs test procedure.

(c)The test procedure for the limbs is as follows:

(1) Seat and orient the dummy without back support on a seating surface that is 11 +/-0.2 inches above a horizontal (floor) surface as specified in ยง 572.78(c).

(i) Orient the dummy as specified in Figure 43 with the hip joint adjustment at any setting between 1g and 2g.

(ii) Place the dummy legs in a plane parallel to the dummy's midsagittal plane with the knee pivot center line perpendicular to the dummy's midsagittal plane, and with the feet flat on the horizontal (floor) surface.

(iii) Adjust the feet and lower legs until the line between the midpoint of each knee pivot and each ankle pivot is within 2 degrees of the vertical.

(2) If necessary, reposition the dummy so that at the level one inch below the seating surface, the rearmost point of the dummy's lower legs remains not less than 3 inches and not more than 6 inches forward of the forward edge of the seat.

(3) Align the test probe specified in ยง 572.77(a) with the longitudinal center line of the femur force gauge, so that at impact, the probe's longitudinal center line coincides with the sensor's longitudinal center line within +/-2 degrees.

(4) Impact the knee with the test probe moving horizontally and parallel to the midsagittal plane at the specified velocity.

(5) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.
