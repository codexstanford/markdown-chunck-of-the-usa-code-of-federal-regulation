### PART 99 - EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CONDUCT
#### Appendix to Subtitle A - United States Railway Association - Employee Responsibilities and Conduct
##### Employees required to submit statement.

(a) Each of the following employees shall submit a statement of employment and financial interest on a form provided by the Association:

(1) Each employee who within the preceding two years was employed by or served as an attorney or consultant to, a railroad or a company significantly engaged in the manufacture, construction or supply of railroad facilities and equipment, including, but not limited to, rolling stock, terminal facilities, signal equipment, track and road bed, and electrical and communication transmission equipment. The General Counsel shall decide, in a doubtful case, whether the relationship to the railroad industry is sufficiently significant as to require submission of a statement of employment and financial interest.

(2) Each employee who is in a position identified in Appendix 2.

(b) Any employee who believes that his position has been improperly included as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and financial interest is entitled to have that inclusion reviewed by the General Counsel.

(c) Any employee in a position which meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded from the reporting requirements of this section if the General Counsel determines that the duties of the position are at such a level of responsibility that the submission of a statement is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review and the remote or inconsequential effect on the integrity of the Association.
