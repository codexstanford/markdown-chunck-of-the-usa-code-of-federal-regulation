The definition of "wheelchair" includes a wide variety of mobility devices. This inclusiveness is consistent with the legislative history of the ADA (See S. Rept. 101-116 at 48). While some mobility devices may not look like many persons' traditional idea of a wheelchair, three- and more-wheeled devices, of many varied designs, are used by individuals with disabilities and must be transported. "Wheelchair" is defined in this rule as a mobility aid belonging to any class of three-or more-wheeled devices, usable indoors, designed or modified for and used by individuals with mobility impairments, whether operated manually or powered. The "three- or-more-wheeled" language in the definition is intended to encompass wheelchairs that may have additional wheels (two extra guide wheels in addition to the more traditional four wheels).
