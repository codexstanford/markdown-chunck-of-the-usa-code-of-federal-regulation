(b) The input data, in the form of an input file, contains the geometry for approximately the first 12 feet of the rigid locomotive design. Because this input file is for a half-symmetric model, a locomotive mass corresponding to 130,000 pounds of weight is provided for modeling purposes-half the 260,000 pounds of weight specified for the locomotive in ยง 238.705(a)(4). Figure 1 to this appendix provides two views of the locomotive's geometric depiction. The input data is contained in Appendix C to FRA's Technical Criteria and Procedures Report, available at.
