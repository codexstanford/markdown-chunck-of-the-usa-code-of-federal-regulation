######## Bonding and grounding containers other than cargo tanks prior to and during transfer of lading.

(b)For containers which are not in metallic contact with each other, either metallic bonds or ground conductors shall be provided for the neutralization of possible static charges prior to and during transfers of Class 3 (flammable liquid) materials between such containers. Such bonding shall be made by first connecting an electric conductor to the container to be filled and subsequently connecting the conductor to the container from which the liquid is to come, and not in any other order. To provide against ignition of vapors by discharge of static electricity, the latter connection shall be made at a point well removed from the opening from which the Class 3 (flammable liquid) material is to be discharged.
