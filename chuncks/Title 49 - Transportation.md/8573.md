(1) A pipeline that is 6inches (168 millimeters) or less in outside nominal diameter, is 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less in length, and all of the following conditions apply to the pipeline:

(i) The pipeline has not experienced a release greater than 1,000 barrels (159 cubic meters) within the previous five years,

(ii) The pipeline has not experienced at least two reportable releases, as defined in ยง 195.50, within the previous five years,
