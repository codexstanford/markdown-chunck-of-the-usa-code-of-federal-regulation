##### ยง 40.129 What are the MRO's functions in reviewing laboratory confirmed non-negative drug test results?
###### e.g.,

(1) If an employer has a stand-down policy that meets the requirements of ยง 40.21 , you may report to the DER that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test result, consistent with the terms of the waiver the employer received. You must not provide any further details about the test result (the name of the drug involved).

(2) If the employer does not have a stand-down policy that meets the requirements of ยง 40.21, you must not inform the employer that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test result until you verify the test result. For example, as an MRO employed directly by a company, you must not tell anyone on the company's staff or management that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed test result.
