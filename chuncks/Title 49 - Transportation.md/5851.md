####### ยง 178.36 Specification 3A and 3AX seamless steel cylinders.
######## Type size and service pressure.

(a)In addition to the requirements of ยง 178.35, cylinders must conform to the following:

(1) A DOT-3A cylinder is a seamless steel cylinder with a water capacity (nominal) not over 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 150 psig.

(2) A DOT-3AX is a seamless steel cylinder with a water capacity not less than 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 500 psig, conforming to the following requirements:

(i) Assuming the cylinder is to be supported horizontally at its two ends only and to be uniformly loaded over its entire length consisting of the weight per unit of length of the straight cylindrical portion filled with water and compressed to the specified test pressure; the sum of two times the maximum tensile stress in the bottom fibers due to bending, plus that in the same fibers (longitudinal stress), due to hydrostatic test may not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength of the steel at such maximum stress. Wall thickness must be increased when necessary to meet the requirement.

(ii) To calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to bending, the following formula must be used:

(iii) To calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to hydrostatic test pressure, the following formula must be used:
