######## New self-reactive materials, formulations and samples.

(c)(1) Except as provided for samples in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, no person may offer, accept for transportation, or transport a self-reactive material which is not identified by technical name in the Self-Reactive Materials Table of this section, or a formulation of one or more self-reactive materials which are identified by technical name in the table, unless the self-reactive material is assigned a generic type and shipping description and is approved by the Associate Administrator under the provisions of ยง 173.124(a)(2)(iii).

(2) Except as provided by an approval issued under ยง 173.124(a)(2)(iii), intermediate bulk and bulk packagings are not authorized.

(3) Samples of new self-reactive materials or new formulations of self-reactive materials identified in the Self-Reactive Materials Table in paragraph (b) of this section, for which complete test data are not available, and which are to be transported for further testing or product evaluation, may be assigned an appropriate shipping description for Self-reactive materials Type C, packaged and offered for transportation under the following conditions:

(i) Data available to the person offering the material for transportation must indicate that the sample would pose a level of hazard no greater than that of a self-reactive material Type B and that the control temperature, if any, is sufficiently low to prevent any dangerous decomposition and sufficiently high to prevent any dangerous phase separation;

(ii) The sample must be packaged in accordance with packing method OP2;

(iii) Packages of the self-reactive material may be offered for transportation and transported in a quantity not to exceed 10 kg (22 pounds) per transport vehicle; and

(iv) One of the following shipping descriptions must be assigned:

(A) Self-reactive, liquid, type C, 4.1, UN 3223.

(B) Self-reactive, solid, type C, 4.1, UN 3224.

(C) Self-reactive, liquid, type C, temperature controlled, 4.1, UN 3233.

(D) Self-reactive, solid, type C, temperature controlled, 4.1, UN 3234.

(4) Samples of organic substances carrying functional groups listed in tables A6.1 and/or A6.2 in Annex 6 (Screening Procedures) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter) may be transported under UN 3224 or UN 3223, as applicable, of Division 4.1 provided that:

(i) The samples do not contain any:

(A) Known explosives;

(B) Substances showing explosive effects in testing;

(C) Compounds designed with the view of producing a practical explosive or pyrotechnic effect;

(D) Components consisting of synthetic precursors of intentional explosives;

(ii) For mixtures, complexes or salts of inorganic oxidizing substances of Division 5.1 with organic material(s), the concentration of the inorganic oxidizing substance is:

(A) Less than 15 percent, by mass, if assigned to Packing Group I or II; or

(B) Less than 30 percent, by mass, if assigned to Packing Group III;

(iii) Available data does not allow a more precise classification;

(iv) The sample is not packed together with other goods;

(v) Must be packaged as follows:

(A) The quantity per individual inner cavity does not exceed 0.01 g for solids or 0.01 mL for liquids and the maximum net quantity per outer packaging does not exceed 20 g for solids or 20 mL for liquids, or in the case of mixed packing the sum of grams and mL does not exceed 20:
