####### Buses.

S6.3.3.2A bus is loaded with ballast (weight) to its GVWR to simulate a multi-passenger and baggage configuration. For this configuration the bus is loaded with test driver, test instrumentation, outriggers (see S6.3.6), ballast, and a simulated occupant in each of the vehicle's designated seating positions. The simulated occupant loads are attained by securing 68 kilograms (150 pounds) of ballast in each of the test vehicle's designated seating positions. If the simulated occupant loads result in the bus being loaded to less than its GVWR, additional ballast is added to the bus in the following manner until the bus is loaded to its GVWR without exceeding any axle's GAWR: First, ballast is added to the lowest baggage compartment; second, ballast is added to the floor of the passenger compartment. If the simulated occupant loads result in the GAWR of any axle being exceeded or the GVWR of the bus being exceeded, simulated occupant loads are removed until the vehicle's GVWR and all axles' GAWR are no longer exceeded.
