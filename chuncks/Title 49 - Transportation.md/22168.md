####### Procedure for measuring infrared reflectance of test rod surface material.

S9.

(a) The infrared reflectance of the rod surface material is measured using a flat sample and an infrared light source and sensor operating at a wavelength of 950 +/-100 nm.

(b) The intensity of incident infrared light is determined using a reference mirror of nominally 100 percent reflectance mounted in place of the sample in the test apparatus in Figure 2.

(c) Infrared reflectance measurements of each sample of test rod surface material and of the reference mirror are corrected to remove the contribution of infrared light reflected and scattered by the sample holder and other parts of the apparatus before computation of the infrared reflectance ratio.
