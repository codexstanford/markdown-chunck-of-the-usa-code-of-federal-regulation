####### ยง 350.217 How are MCSAP funds allocated?
######## Hold-harmless provision and funding cap.

(e)(1) The dollar amounts calculated under paragraphs (c)(6) and (d)(5) of this section will be totaled for each State and then divided by the total MCSAP funds available for allocation under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to determine a State's percentage of the total MCSAP funds.

(2) Each State's percentage of total MCSAP funding in the fiscal year immediately prior to the year for which funding is being allocated will be determined by dividing the State's dollar allocation by the total MCSAP funding in that prior year, excluding funds allocated to the Territories of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.

(3) Proportional adjustments will be made to ensure that each State's percentage of MCSAP funds as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be no less than 97 percent or more than 105 percent of the State's percentage of MCSAP funds allocated for the prior fiscal year as calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
