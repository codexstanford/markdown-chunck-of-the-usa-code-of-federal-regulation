######## Crucibles:

(d)Nonspecification crucibles designed and constructed such that the stress in the packaging does not exceed one fourth (0.25) of the ultimate strength of the packaging material at any temperature within the design temperature range. Stress is determined under a load equal to the sum of the static or working pressure in combination with the loads developed from accelerations and decelerations incident to normal transportation. For highway transportation, these forces are assumed to be "1.7g" vertical, "0.75g" longitudinal, and "0.4g" transverse, in reference to the axes of the transport vehicle. Each accelerative or decelerative load may be considered separately.
