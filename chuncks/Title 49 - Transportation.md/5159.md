######## Pressure relief devices for piping hose and vacuum-insulated jackets.

(9)(i) Each portion of connected liquid piping or hose that can be closed at both ends must be provided with either a hydrostatic pressure relief valve without an intervening shut-off valve, or a check valve permitting flow from the pipe or hose into the tank. If used, the relief valve must be located so as to prevent its discharge from impinging on the tank, piping, or operating personnel.

(ii) On a vacuum-insulated cargo tank the jacket must be protected by a suitable relief device to release internal pressure. The discharge area of this device must be at least 0.00024 square inch per pound of water capacity of the tank. This relief device must function at a pressure not exceeding the internal design pressure of the jacket, calculated in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 psig, whichever is less.
