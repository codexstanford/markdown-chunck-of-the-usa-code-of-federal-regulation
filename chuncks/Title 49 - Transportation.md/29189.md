###### Land.

2-3(a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in transportation operations and also for land used in other than transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed for property used in other than transportation operations. It is not contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.

(b) [Reserved]
