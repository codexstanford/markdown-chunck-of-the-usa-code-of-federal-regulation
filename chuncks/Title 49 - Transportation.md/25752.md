#### PART 580 - ODOMETER DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
##### ยง 580.3 Definitions.
###### Electronic title

means a title created and maintained in an electronic format by a jurisdiction that meets all the requirements of this part. An electronic title incorporates an electronic reassignment form or process containing the disclosures required by this part facilitating transfers between transferors and transferees who do not take title to the vehicle. As set forth in ยง 580.5(g), an electronic reassignment may precede issuance of an electronic title when no electronic title exists. For the purposes of this part, this term is limited to a record created electronically and does not include a physical title incorporating an odometer disclosure executed on that title and converted by scanning and imaging for storage in an electronic medium.
