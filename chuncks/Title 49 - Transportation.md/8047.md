####### ยง 192.607 Verification of Pipeline Material Properties and Attributes: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.
######## Verification of material properties and attributes.,in situ

(c)If an operator does not have traceable, verifiable, and complete records required by paragraph (b) of this section, the operator must develop and implement procedures for conducting nondestructive or destructive tests, examinations, and assessments in order to verify the material properties of aboveground line pipe and components, and of buried line pipe and components when excavations occur at the following opportunities: Anomaly direct examinations,evaluations, repairs, remediations, maintenance, and excavations that are associated with replacements or relocations of pipeline segments that are removed from service. The procedures must also provide for the following:

(1) For nondestructive tests, at each test location, material properties for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be determined at a minimum of 5 places in at least 2 circumferential quadrants of the pipe for a minimum total of 10 test readings at each pipe cylinder location.

(2) For destructive tests, at each test location, a set of material properties tests for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be conducted on each test pipe cylinder removed from each location, in accordance with API Specification 5L.

(3) Tests, examinations, and assessments must be appropriate for verifying the necessary material properties and attributes.

(4) If toughness properties are not documented, the procedures must include accepted industry methods for verifying pipe material toughness.

(5) Verification of material properties and attributes for non-line pipe components must comply with paragraph (f) of this section.
