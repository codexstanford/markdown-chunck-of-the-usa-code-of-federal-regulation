###### ยง 571.106 Standard No. 106; Brake hoses.
####### e.g.

(b) Brake hose assemblies that are to be used for additional testing have constriction testing only at each end fitting. Other brake hose assemblies may be cut into 3-inch lengths to permit constriction testing of the entire assembly. Hose assemblies with end fittings that do not permit entry of the gauge (, restrictive orifice or banjo fitting) are cut 3 inches from the point at which the hose terminates in the end fitting and then tested from the cut end.

(c) Hold the brake hose in a straight position and vertical orientation.

(d) Place the spherical end of the plug gauge just inside the hose or end fitting. If the spherical end will not enter the hose or end fitting using no more force than gravity acting on the plug gauge, this constitutes failure of the constriction test.

(e) Release the plug gauge. Within 3 seconds, the plug gauge shall fall under the force of gravity alone up to the handle of the gauge. If the plug gauge does not fully enter the hose up to the handle of the gauge within three seconds, this constitutes failure of the constriction test.
