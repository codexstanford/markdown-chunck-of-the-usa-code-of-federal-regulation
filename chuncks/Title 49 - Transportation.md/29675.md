(c)(1) The contract summary identification number must include the word "STB," the standard carrier alphabetic code for the filing railroad (limited to four letters), the letter "C," and a sequential number, with each separated by a hyphen. The following is an example: the 357th contract summary filed by the Conrail would have the following identification number: "STB-CR-C-357."

(2) At its option, the carrier may issue contract summaries with nonconsecutive numbers if it assigns blocks of numbers for specific uses. An index to the blocks of reserved numbers shall be filed with the Board.
