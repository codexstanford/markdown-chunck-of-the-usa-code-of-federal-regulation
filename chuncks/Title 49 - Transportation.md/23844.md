####### Elongation.

(c)Elongation shall be measured during the breaking strength test described in paragraph (b) of this section by the following procedure: A preload between 196 N and 245 N shall be placed on the webbing mounted in the grips of the testing machine and the needle points of an extensometer, in which the points remain parallel during test, are inserted in the center of the specimen. Initially the points shall be set at a known distance apart between 102 and 203 mm. When the force on the webbing reaches the value specified in S4.2(c), the increase in separation of the points of the extensometer shall be measured and the percent elongation shall be calculated to the nearest 0.5 percent. Each value shall be not more than the appropriate elongation requirement in S4.2(c).
