##### ยง 535.5 Standards.
###### Subfamily standards.

(3)Starting in model year 2027, manufacturers may generate or use fuel consumption credits for averaging to demonstrate compliance with the standards specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section as described in ยง 535.7(e). This requires that manufacturers specify a Family Emission Limit (FEL) for fuel consumption for each vehicle subfamily. The FEL may not be less than the result of the emission and fuel consumption calculation in 40 CFR 1037.515. The FEL may not be greater than the appropriate standard for model year 2021 trailers. These FELs serve as the fuel consumption standards for the specific vehicle subfamily instead of the standards specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Manufacturers may not use averaging for non-box trailers, partial-aero box vans, or non-aero box vans that meet standards under paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(ii) of this section, and manufacturers may not use fuel consumption credits for banking or trading for any trailers.
