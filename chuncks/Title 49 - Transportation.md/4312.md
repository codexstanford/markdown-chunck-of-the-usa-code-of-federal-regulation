#### Subchapter C - Hazardous Materials Regulations
##### PART 173 - SHIPPERS - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SHIPMENTS AND PACKAGINGS
###### Subpart B - Preparation of Hazardous Materials for Transportation
####### § 173.27 General requirements for transportation by aircraft.
######## Pressure requirements.

(c)(1) Packagings must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be caused by changes in altitude and temperature during transportation aboard aircraft.

(2) Except for packagings used for material transported as "UN3082, Environmentally hazardous substance, liquid, n.o.s.," packagings for which retention of liquid is a basic function must be capable of withstanding without leakage the greater of-

(i) An internal pressure which produces a gauge pressure of not less than 75 kPa (11 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1; or 95 kPa (14 psig) for other liquids; or

(ii) A pressure related to the vapor pressure of the liquid to be conveyed, determined by one of the following:

(A) The total gauge pressure measured in the receptacle (i.e., the vapor pressure of the material and the partial pressure of air or other inert gases, less 100 kPa (15 psia)) at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5; determined on the basis of a filling temperature of 15 &#xB0;C (59 &#xB0;F) and a degree of filling such that the receptacle is not completely liquid full at a temperature of 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F) or less;

(B) 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F) less 100 kPa (15 psia); or

(C) 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;) less 100 kPa (15 psia).

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section-

(i) Hazardous materials may be contained in an inner packaging which does not itself meet the pressure requirement provided that the inner packaging is packed within a supplementary packaging which does meet the pressure requirement and other applicable packaging requirements of this subchapter.

(ii) Packagings which are subject to the hydrostatic pressure test and marking requirements of §§ 178.605 and 178.503(a)(5), respectively, of this subchapter must have a marked test pressure of not less than 250 kPa (36 psig) for liquids in Packing Group I, 80 kPa (12 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1, and 100 kPa (15 psig) for other liquids.
