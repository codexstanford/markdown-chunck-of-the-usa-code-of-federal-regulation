##### ยง 24.404 Replacement housing of last resort.
###### Determination to provide replacement housing of last resort.

(a)Whenever a program or project cannot proceed on a timely basis because comparable replacement dwellings are not available within the monetary limits for owners or tenants, as specified in ยง 24.401 or ยง 24.402, as appropriate, the Agency shall provide additional or alternative assistance under the provisions of this subpart. Any decision to provide last resort housing assistance must be adequately justified either:

(1) On a case-by-case basis, for good cause, which means that appropriate consideration has been given to:

(i) The availability of comparable replacement housing in the program or project area;

(ii) The resources available to provide comparable replacement housing; and

(iii) The individual circumstances of the displaced person, or

(2) By a determination that:

(i) There is little, if any, comparable replacement housing available to displaced persons within an entire program or project area; and, therefore, last resort housing assistance is necessary for the area as a whole;

(ii) A program or project cannot be advanced to completion in a timely manner without last resort housing assistance; and

(iii) The method selected for providing last resort housing assistance is cost effective, considering all elements, which contribute to total program or project costs.
