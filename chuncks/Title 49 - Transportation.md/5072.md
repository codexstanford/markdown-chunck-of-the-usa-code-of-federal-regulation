######## Accumulators (Articles, pressurized pneumatic or hydraulic containing non-flammable gas).

(f)The following applies to accumulators, which are hydraulic accumulators containing nonliquefied, nonflammable gas, and nonflammable liquids or pneumatic accumulators containing nonliquefied, nonflammable gas, fabricated from materials which will not fragment upon rupture.

(1) Accumulators installed in motor vehicles, construction equipment, and assembled machinery and designed and fabricated with a burst pressure of not less than five times their charged pressure at 70 &#xB0;F, when shipped, are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

(2) Accumulators charged with limited quantities of compressed gas to not more than 200 psig at 70 &#xB0;F are excepted from labeling (except when offered for transportation by air) and the specification packaging requirements of this subchapter when shipped under the following conditions. In addition, shipments are not subject to subpart F (placarding) of part 172 of this subchapter, to part 174 of this subchapter except ยง 174.24 and to part 177 of this subchapter except ยง 177.817.

(i) Each accumulator must be shipped as an inside packaging. Robust accumulators may be transported unpackaged, in crates, or in appropriate overpacks, when the hazardous materials are afforded equivalent protection by the article in which they are contained;

(ii) Each accumulator may not have a gas space exceeding 2,500 cubic inches under stored pressure; and

(iii) Each accumulator must be tested, without evidence of failure or damage, to at least three times its charged pressure of 70 &#xB0;F, but not less than 120 psi before initial shipment and before each refilling and reshipment.

(3) Accumulators with a charging pressure exceeding 200 psig at 70 &#xB0;F and in compliance with the requirements stated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, as applicable, are excepted from labeling (except when offered for transportation by air) and the specification packaging requirements of this subchapter when shipped under the following conditions:

(i) Each accumulator must be designed and fabricated with a burst pressure of not less than five (5) times its charged pressure at 70 &#xB0;F when shipped;

(ii) For an accumulator with a gas space not to exceed 100 cubic inches, it must be designed and fabricated with a burst pressure of not less than five (5) times its charged pressure at 70 &#xB0;F. Out of each lot not to exceed 1,000 successively produced accumulators per day of the same type, accumulators must be tested, in lieu of the testing of paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, as follows:

(A) One (1) accumulator must be tested to the minimum design burst pressure;

(B) Two (2) accumulators, one at the beginning of production and one at the end must be tested to at least two and a half times the charge pressure without evidence of leakage or distortion;

(C) If accumulators fail either test, an additional four (4) sets of accumulators from the lot may be tested. If any additional accumulators fail, the lot must be rejected;

(iii) For an accumulator with a gas space not to exceed 30 cubic inches, it must be designed and fabricated with a burst pressure of not less than four (4) times its charged pressure at 70 &#xB0;F. Out of each lot not to exceed 1,000 successively produced accumulators per day of the same type, accumulators must be tested, in lieu of the testing of paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, as follows:

(A) One (1) accumulator must be tested to the minimum design burst pressure;

(B) Two (2) accumulators, one at the beginning of production and one at the end must be tested to at least two and a half times the charge pressure without evidence of leakage or distortion;

(C) If accumulators fail either test, an additional four (4) sets of accumulators from the lot may be tested. If any additional accumulators fail, the lot must be rejected;

(iv) Accumulators must be packaged in strong outer packaging. Robust accumulators may be transported unpackaged, in crates, or in appropriate overpacks, when the hazardous materials are afforded equivalent protection by the article in which they are contained.

(4) Accumulators intended to function as shock absorbers, struts, gas springs, pneumatic springs or other impact or energy-absorbing devices are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter provided each:

(i) Has a gas space capacity not exceeding 1.6 L and a charge pressure not exceeding 280 bar, where the product of the capacity expressed in liters and charge pressure expressed in bars does not exceed 80 (for example, 0.5 L gas space and 160 bar charge pressure);

(ii) Has a minimum burst pressure of 4 times the charge pressure at 20 &#xB0;C for products not exceeding 0.5 L gas space capacity and 5 times the charge pressure for products greater than 0.5 L gas space capacity;

(iii) Design type has been subjected to a fire test demonstrating that the article relieves its pressure by means of a fire degradable seal or other pressure relief device, such that the article will not fragment and that the article does not rocket; and

(iv) Accumulators must be manufactured under a written quality assurance program which monitors parameters controlling burst strength, burst mode and performance in a fire situation as specified in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) through (f)(4)(iii) of this section. A copy of the quality assurance program must be maintained at each facility at which the accumulators are manufactured.

(5) Accumulators not conforming to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section may only be transported subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.
