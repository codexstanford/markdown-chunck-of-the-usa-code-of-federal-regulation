####### ยง 1150.1 Introduction.
######## When an application is required.

(a)This subpart governs applications under 49 U.S.C. 10901 for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction, acquisition or operation of railroad lines. Noncarriers require Board approval under section 10901 to construct, acquire or operate a rail line in interstate commerce. Existing carriers require approval under section 10901 only to construct a new rail line or operate a line owned by a noncarrier, since acquisition by a carrier of an active rail line owned by a carrier is covered by 49 U.S.C. 11323. We have exempted from these requirements the acquisition by a State entity of a rail line that has been approved for abandonment, as well as operations over these lines. See subpart C of this part. In addition, where appropriate, we have granted individual exemptions from these certification requirements. See 49 U.S.C. 10502.
