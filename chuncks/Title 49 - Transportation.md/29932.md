######## Interlocutory appeal for cause.

(b)If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the ALJ, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the ALJ issues a decision on the request. If the ALJ grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The ALJ must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.
