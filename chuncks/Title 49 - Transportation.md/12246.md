####### Computation of percent operative power brakes.

(d)(1) The percentage of operative power brakes in a train shall be based on the number of control valves in the train. The percentage shall be determined by dividing the number of control valves that are cut-in by the total number of control valves in the train. A control valve shall not be considered cut-in if the brakes controlled by that valve are inoperative. Both cars and locomotives shall be considered when making this calculation.

(2) The following brake conditions not in compliance with this part are not considered inoperative power brakes for purposes of this section:

(i) Failure or cutting out of secondary brake systems;

(ii) Inoperative or otherwise defective handbrakes or parking brakes;

(iii) Piston travel that is in excess of the Class I brake test limits required in ยง 232.205 but that does not exceed the outside limits contained on the stencil, sticker, or badge plate required by ยง 232.103(g) for considering the power brakes to be effective; and

(iv) Power brakes overdue for inspection, testing, maintenance, or stenciling under this part.
