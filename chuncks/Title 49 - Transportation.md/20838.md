####### Apparatus.

S8.6.1A tension testing machine that is power-driven and that applies a constant rate of extension is used for measuring the force required to separate the layers of the test specimen. The apparatus is constructed so that:

(a) The recording head includes a freely rotating form with an outside diameter substantially the same as the inside diameter of the hose specimen to be placed on it.

(b) The freely rotating form is mounted so that its axis of rotation is in the plane of the ply being separated from the specimen and so that the applied force is perpendicular to the tangent of the specimen circumference at the line of separation.

(c) The rate of travel of the power-actuated grip is a uniform one inch per minute and the capacity of the machine is such that maximum applied tension during the test is not more than 85 percent nor less than 15 percent of the machine's rated capacity.

(d) The machine produces a chart with separation as one coordinate and applied tension as the other.
