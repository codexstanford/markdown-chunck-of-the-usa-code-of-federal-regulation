####### Quantitative analysis,Methodology.

(b)-(1)The first phase of FRA's annual analysis is a statistically-based quantitative analysis of each railroad within the scope of the analysis, using historical safety data maintained by FRA for the three most recent full calendar years. The purpose of the quantitative analysis is to make a threshold identification of railroads that possibly have inadequate safety performance. The quantitative analysis consists of a preliminary selection and a rate-based analysis. Only railroads that the preliminary selection identifies will proceed to the rate-based analysis.

(i) The preliminary selection calculates the following values:

(A) A railroad's number of worker on duty fatalities during the 3-year period, calculated using "Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A)," "Worker on Duty-Contractor (Class F)," and "Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H)" information reported on FRA Form 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter; and

(B) The sum total of a railroad's number of worker on duty injuries/illnesses during the 3-year period (calculated using "Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A)," "Worker on Duty-Contractor (Class F)," and "Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H)" information reported on FRA Form 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter) added to the number of rail equipment accidents/incidents during the 3-year period (calculated using information reported on FRA Forms 6180.54 and 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter).

(ii) For railroads that the preliminary selection identifies, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the rate-based analysis calculates the following three factors:

(A) A railroad's number of worker on duty fatalities during the 3-year period, calculated using "Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A)," "Worker on Duty-Contractor (Class F)," and "Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H)" information reported on FRA Form 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter;

(B) A railroad's on duty employee injury/illness rate, calculated using "Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A)," "Worker on Duty-Contractor (Class F)," and "Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H)" information reported on FRA Form 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter. FRA calculates this rate using the following formula, which gives the rate of employee injuries/illnesses per 200,000 employee hours over a 3-year period:

(C) A railroad's rail equipment accident/incident rate, calculated using information reported on FRA Forms 6180.54 and 6180.55 pursuant to FRA's accident/incident reporting regulations in part 225 of this chapter. FRA calculates this rate using the following formula, which gives the rate of rail equipment accidents/incidents per 1,000,000 train miles operated over a 3-year period:
