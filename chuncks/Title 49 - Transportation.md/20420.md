####### Inspection procedure.

(1)Verify that toe-in or toe-out is not greater than 1.5 times the values listed in the vehicle manufacturer's service specification for alignment settings as measured by a bar-type scuff gauge or other toe-in measuring device. Values to convert toe-in readings in inches to scuff gauge readings in ft/mi side-slip for different wheel sizes are provided in Table I. Tire diameters used in computing scuff gauge readings are based on the average maximum tire dimensions of grown tires in service for typical wheel and tire assemblies.
