###### Appendix F to Part 192 - Criteria for Conducting Integrity Assessments Using Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT)
####### Direct examination of all indications above the detection sensitivity threshold.

XVIII.The use of GWUT in the "Go-No Go" mode requires that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (5% of CSA sensitivity) be directly examined (or replaced) prior to completing the integrity assessment on the cased carrier pipe or other GWUT application. If this cannot be accomplished, then alternative methods of assessment (such as hydrostatic pressure tests or ILI) must be utilized.
