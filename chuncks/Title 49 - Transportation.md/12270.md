(iii) Removing cars determined to be defective under this chapter; or

(iv) A combination of the changes listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section (See §§ 232.209 and 232.211 for requirements related to the pick-up of cars and solid blocks of cars en route.);

(3) A location where the train is off-air for a period of more than 24 hours.

(4) A location where a unit or cycle train has traveled 3,000 miles since its last Class I brake test; and

(5) A location where the train is received in interchange if the train consist is changed other than by:

(i) Removing a car or a solid block of cars from the train;

(ii) Adding a previously tested car or a previously tested solid block of cars to the train;

(iii) Changing motive power;

(iv) Removing or changing the caboose; or

(b) Except as provided in § 232.209, each car and each solid block of cars added to a train shall receive a Class I brake test as described in paragraph (c) of this section at the location where it is added to a train unless:

(1) The solid block of cars is comprised of cars from a single previous train, the cars of which have previously received a Class I brake test and have remained continuously and consecutively coupled together with the train line remaining connected, other than for removing defective equipment, since being removed from its previous train and have not been off-air for more than 24 hours; or

(2) The solid block of cars is comprised of cars from a single previous train, the cars of which were required to be separated into multiple solid blocks of cars due to space or trackage constraints at a particular location when removed from the previous train, provided the cars have previously received a Class I brake test, have not been off-air more than 24 hours, and the cars in each of the multiple blocks of cars have remained continuously and consecutively coupled together with the train line remaining connected, except for the removal of defective equipment. Furthermore, these multiple solid blocks of cars shall be added to a train in the same relative order (no reclassification) as when removed from the previous train, except for the removal of defective equipment.

(c) A Class I brake test of a train shall consist of the following tasks and requirements:

(1) Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute or air flow shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM).
