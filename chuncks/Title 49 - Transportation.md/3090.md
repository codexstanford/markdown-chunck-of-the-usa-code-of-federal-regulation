### PART 99 - EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CONDUCT

##### Indebtedness.

Each employee shall pay his just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner, especially those imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For the purposes of this section "just financial obligations" means those that are recognized as such by the employee or reduced to a judgment by a court, and "in a proper and timely manner" means in a manner which the Association determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Association as his employer. The Association will not determine the validity or amount of a disputed debt and will not initiate action to collect such debts.
