##### 18. Hard-to-Maneuver Stops.,e.g.,

A passenger may request that a paratransit vehicle navigate to a pick-up point to which it is difficult to maneuver a vehicle. A passenger's request to be picked up in a location that is difficult, but not impossible or impracticable, to access should generally be granted as long as picking up the passenger does not expose the vehicle to hazards that pose a direct threat (it is unsafe for the vehicle and its occupants to get to the pick-up point without getting stuck or running off the road).
