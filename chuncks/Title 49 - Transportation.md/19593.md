##### ยง 535.3 Applicability.
###### Transitional allowances for trailers.

(3)Through model year 2026, trailer manufacturers may calculate a number of trailers that are exempt from the fuel consumption standards of this part. Calculate the number of exempt box vans in a given model year by multiplying the manufacturer's total U.S.-directed production volume of certified box vans by 0.20 and rounding to the nearest whole number; however, in no case may the number of exempted box vans be greater than 350 units in any given model year. Repeat this calculation to determine the number of non-box trailers, up to 250 annual units, that are exempt from standards and certification requirements. Manufacturers perform the calculation based on their projected production volumes in the first year that standards apply; in later years, use actual production volumes from the preceding model year. Manufacturers must include these calculated values and the production volumes of exempt trailers in their annual production reports required under ยง 535.8(g)(12).
