(D) Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require an Agency to provide a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. (appendix A, ยง 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D).)

(E) The Agency shall offer all persons transportation to inspect housing to which they are referred.
