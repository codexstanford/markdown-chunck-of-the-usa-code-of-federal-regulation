###### Normal operation.

(1)The system (including all hardware and software) should demonstrate safe operation with no hardware failures under normal anticipated operating conditions with proper inputs and within the expected range of environmental conditions. All safety-critical functions should be performed properly under these normal conditions. Absence of specific operator actions or procedures will not prevent the system from operating safely. Hazards categorized as unacceptable should be eliminated by design. Best effort should also be made by the designer to eliminate hazards that are undesirable. Those undesirable hazards that cannot be eliminated must be mitigated to an acceptable level.
