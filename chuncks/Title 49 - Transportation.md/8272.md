####### ยง 192.927 What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA)?
######## General requirements.,see

(b)An operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to address internal corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference,ยง 192.7), section 6.4 and appendix B2. The ICDA process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting nominally dry natural gas, and not for a segment with electrolyte nominally present in the gas stream. If an operator uses ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolyte present in the gas stream, the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct ICDA in the segment to effectively address internal corrosion, and must provide notification in accordance with ยง 192.921 (a)(4) or ยง 192.937(c)(4).
