####### ยง 176.83 Segregation.
######## Segregation between shipborne barges on barge-carrying vessels:

(j)(1) When a shipborne barge is loaded with two or more hazardous materials with different requirements for segregation, the most stringent applicable segregation requirement must be applied.

(2) "Away from" and "separated from" require no segregation between shipborne barges.

(3) For barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, "Separated by a complete compartment or hold from" means that separate holds are required. On barge-carrying vessels having horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels are required and the barges may not be in the same vertical line.

(4) "Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from" means, for barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, that separation by an intervening hold or engine room is required. On barge-carrying vessels having horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels and a longitudinal separation by at least two intervening barge spaces are required.
