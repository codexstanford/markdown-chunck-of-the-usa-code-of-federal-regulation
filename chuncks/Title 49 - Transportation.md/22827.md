####### Test conditions and procedures.

S7.9.2.(a) IBT: &#x2264;65 &#xB0;C (149 &#xB0;F), &#x2264;100 &#xB0;C (212 &#xB0;F).

(b) Test speed: 100 km/h (62.1 mph).

(c) Pedal force: &#x2264;65 N (14.6 lbs), &#x2264;500 N (112.4 lbs).

(d) Wheel lockup: No lockup of any wheel for longer than 0.1 seconds allowed at speeds greater than 15 km/h (9.3 mph).

(e) Number of runs: 6 stops.

(f) Test surface: PFC of 1.02.

(g) Functional failure simulation:

(1) Disconnect the functional power source or mechanical linkage to render the variable brake proportioning system inoperative.

(2) If the system utilizes electrical components, determine whether the brake system indicator is activated when any electrical functional failure of the variable proportioning system is created.

(3) Restore the system to normal at the completion of this test.

(h) If more than one variable brake proportioning subsystem is provided, repeat the test for each subsystem.
