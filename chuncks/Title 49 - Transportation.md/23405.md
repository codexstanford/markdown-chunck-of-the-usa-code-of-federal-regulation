(a) Increase the force on each force application device as linearly as practicable until a force of 9,000 N is achieved on each force application device in not less than 90 seconds and not more than 120 seconds, or until either force application device reaches a total displacement of 300 mm.

(b) If one of the force application devices reaches the target force of 9,000 N prior to the other, maintain the 9,000 N force with that force application device until the second force application device reaches the 9,000 N force.

(c) Once both force application devices have achieved 9,000 N each hold the resulting load.

(d) Maintain each force application device load as specified in paragraph (c) and within 30 seconds measure the separation between the exterior edge of the doorframe and the interior of the door along the perimeter of the door.
