FMCSA recognizes that this guidance has compliance implications for motor carriers that previously considered themselves not subject to certain Agency requirements because such carriers mistakenly believed their passenger transportation operations were in intrastate commerce only, not for-hire, and/or otherwise exempt. It should be emphasized, however, that while for-hire motor carriers operating in interstate commerce must obtain both commercial operating authority registration (no matter how small or light the vehicle(s) used, unless exempted), and safety registration under 49 U.S.C. 31134,the safety regulations apply only to motor carriers (private and for-hire) operating in interstate commerce that use vehicles that qualify asas defined in 49 U.S.C. 31132(1) and §§ 390.5T and 390.5.

The following examples show the real-world implications and interactions of "interstate commerce," "CMV," "compensation," "for-hire," and "private" carriage, and a variety of regulatory exemptions and exceptions. These examples are arranged in topical categories. The first provides guidance on the meaning of "interstate commerce." All subsequent examples provide guidance in three regulatory applicability contexts, specifically (1) operating authority registration, (2) minimum level of financial responsibility, and (3) general safety regulatory jurisdiction.

In determining the scope of FMCSA's jurisdiction for each of the following specific scenarios the analytical framework described early in this notice is employed. Specifically, for each scenario, the Agency considered whether the operation falls within FMCSA's jurisdiction based on the various statutory definitions, and, if so, whether any statutory or regulatory exemption limits the applicability of the FMCSRs. Again, should new scenarios arise in the future, the same analytical framework would be employed to determine whether a specific operation is subject to FMCSA's oversight.

In this section, FMCSA demonstrates the applicability of the FMCSRs to motor carriers of passengers operating in interstate commerce by providing example scenarios grouped into six categories below. Some of the analysis provided in response to these example scenarios cites to regulatory sections that FMCSA designated as temporary sections in a final rule published on January 17, 2017 (82 FR 5292). FMCSA notes that, to the extent the language between the suspended section and the temporary section is substantively the same, this guidance would also apply to the corresponding language in the suspended section once the suspension is lifted and the temporary section is eliminated, just as the pre-existing guidance for the now-suspended sections was applied to the corresponding language of the temporary sections that were substantively the same.
