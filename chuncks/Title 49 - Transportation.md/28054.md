###### ยง 1034.1 Temporary authority.
####### Authority.

(a)Any railroad subject to regulation under 49 U.S.C. 10501 may reasonably divert or reroute traffic to other carriers, if it is unable due to circumstances beyond its control promptly to transport traffic over a portion of its lines. Traffic necessarily diverted under this authority shall be rerouted to preserve as much as possible the participation and revenues of other carriers provided in the original routing. This authority may be exercised for no more than 30 days following the day on which the rerouting begins. If a carrier needs more than 30 days before its disability or the disability of a receiving carrier is cured, it may automatically extend its rerouting for additional 30-day periods. To extend the period, it must submit a written or electronic notice to the Association of American Railroads and the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance explaining why the rerouting is necessary, when it began, when the disability occurred, why an extension is necessary, the specific lines disabled, the rerouting to be continued, which shippers are affected, and any other important facts.
