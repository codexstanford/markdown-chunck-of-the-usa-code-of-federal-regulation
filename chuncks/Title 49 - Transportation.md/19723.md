###### Subconfiguration target standards.

(2)(i) Two alternatives exist for determining the subconfiguration target standards for Phase 1. For each alternative, separate standards exist for compression-ignition and spark-ignition vehicles:

(A) The first alternative allows manufacturers to determine a fixed fuel consumption standard that is constant over the model years; and

(B) The second alternative allows manufacturers to determine standards that are phased-in gradually each year.

(ii) Calculate the subconfiguration target standards as specified in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), using the appropriate coefficients from Table 6 choosing between the alternatives in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. For electric or fuel cell heavy-duty vehicles, use compression-ignition vehicle coefficients "c" and "d" and for hybrid (including plug-in hybrid), dedicated and dual-fueled vehicles, use coefficients "c" and "d" appropriate for the engine type used. Round each standard to the nearest 0.001 gallons per 100 miles and specify all weights in pounds rounded to the nearest pound. Calculate the subconfiguration target standards using the following equation:
