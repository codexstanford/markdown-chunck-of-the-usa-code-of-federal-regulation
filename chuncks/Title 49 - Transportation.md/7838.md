######## General requirements for plastic pipe and components.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, the design pressure for plastic pipe may not exceed a gauge pressure of 100 psig (689 kPa) for pipe used in:

(i) Distribution systems; or

(ii) Transmission lines in Class 3 and 4 locations.

(2) Plastic pipe may not be used where operating temperatures of the pipe will be:

(i) Below -20 &#xB0;F (-29 &#xB0;C), or below -40 &#xB0;F (-40 &#xB0;C) if all pipe and pipeline components whose operating temperature will be below -20 &#xB0;F (-29 &#xB0;C) have a temperature rating by the manufacturer consistent with that operating temperature; or

(ii) Above the temperature at which the HDB used in the design formula under this section is determined.

(3) Unless specified for a particular material in this section, the wall thickness of plastic pipe may not be less than 0.062 inches (1.57 millimeters).
