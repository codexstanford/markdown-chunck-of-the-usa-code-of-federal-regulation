(a)When a description of hazardous material is required to be included on a shipping paper, that description must conform to the following requirements:

(1) When a hazardous material and a material not subject to the requirements of this subchapter are described on the same shipping paper, the hazardous material description entries required by § 172.202 and those additional entries that may be required by § 172.203:

(i) Must be entered first, or

(ii) Must be entered in a color that clearly contrasts with any description on the shipping paper of a material not subject to the requirements of this subchapter, except that a description on a reproduction of a shipping paper may be highlighted, rather than printed, in a contrasting color (the provisions of this paragraph apply only to the basic description required by § 172.202(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4)), or

(iii) Must be identified by the entry of an "X" placed before the basic shipping description required by § 172.202 in a column captioned "HM." (The "X" may be replaced by "RQ," if appropriate.)

(2) The required shipping description on a shipping paper and all copies of the shipping paper used for transportation purposes must be legible and printed (manually or mechanically) in English.

(3) Unless it is specifically authorized or required in this subchapter, the required shipping description may not contain any code or abbreviation.

(4) A shipping paper may contain additional information concerning the material provided the information is not inconsistent with the required description. Unless otherwise permitted or required by this subpart, additional information must be placed after the basic description required by § 172.202(a).
