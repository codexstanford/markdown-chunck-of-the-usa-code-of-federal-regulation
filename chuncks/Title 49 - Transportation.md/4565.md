######## Solvent Separation Test.

(ii)This test is carried out at 23 &#xB0;C (73 &#xB0;F) using a 100.0 mL(3 ounces) measuring cylinder of the stoppered type of approximately 25.0 cm (9.8 inches) total height and of a uniform internal diameter of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) over the calibrated section. The sample should be stirred to obtain a uniform consistency, and poured in up to the 100 mL (3 ounces) mark. The stopper should be inserted and the cylinder left standing undisturbed for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the height of the upper separated layer should be measured and the percentage of this layer as compared with the total height of the sample calculated.
