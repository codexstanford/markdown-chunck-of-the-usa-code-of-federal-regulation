##### PART 1130 - INFORMAL COMPLAINTS
###### ยง 1130.2 When damages sought.
####### Notification to the parties; six months' rule.

(f)If an informal complaint seeking damages (other than a contested tariff reconciliation petition) cannot be disposed of informally or is denied or withdrawn by complainant, the parties affected will be so notified in writing by the Board. Contested tariff reconciliation petitions either will be granted or denied by the entry of a decision. Unless within six months after the date on which a notice is mailed or a decision is served, a party either files a formal complaint or resubmits its informal complaint on an additional-fact basis, the matter in the complaint or petition will not be reconsidered. The claim will be considered abandoned and no complaint seeking damages on the same cause of action will be accepted unless filed within the statutory period. Any filing or resubmission satisfying the six months' requirement will be considered filed as of the date of the original filing and must specifically refer to that date and to the Board's file number. Any petition for reconsideration should be filed with the Board.
