######## Wall thickness.

(f)The wall thickness of the cylinder must conform to the following:

(1) For cylinders with an outside diameter over 5 inches, the minimum wall thickness is 0.078 inch. In any case, the minimum wall thickness must be such that the calculated wall stress at the minimum test pressure (in paragraph (i) of this section) may not exceed the lesser value of either of the following:

(i) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the material determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section; or

(ii) 35,000 psi.

(2) Calculation must be made by the formula:

(3) The ratio of tangential length to outside diameter may not exceed 4.0 for cylinders with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch.
