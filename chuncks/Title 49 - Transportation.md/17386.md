FMCSA has been asked if its commercial and safety jurisdiction over a motor carrier of passengers requires some threshold ratio of interstate to intrastate trips. Many motor carriers have a mixture of interstate and intrastate passenger transportation operations. To answer this question, we look back to a case interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In this case, only 3 to 4 percent of a carrier's trips were interstate in nature, and the Supreme Court held that, under the 1935 Act, the ICC had authority to impose its hours of service rules on all of the company's drivers because they were randomly assigned to handle interstate trips, even though 2 out of about 40 drivers had not made a single interstate trip during the 21 months at issue in that case (v.332 U.S. 422 (1947)). The Court said "[w]e hold that the Commission has theto establish qualifications and maximum hours of service, pursuant to the provisions of ยง 204 of the Motor Carrier Act [of 1935], for the entire classification of petitioner's drivers and `mechanics' and it is the existence of that power (rather than the precise terms of the requirements actually established by the Commission in the exercise of that power) that Congress has made the test as to whether or not [the overtime requirement of] ยง 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is applicable to these employees." Ibid. at 434.
