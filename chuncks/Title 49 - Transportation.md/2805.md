##### ยง 40.307 What is the SAP's function in prescribing the employee's follow-up tests?
###### e.g.,

(1) You may require a greater number of follow-up tests during the first 12-month period of safety-sensitive duty (you may require one test a month during the 12-month period; you may require two tests per month during the first 6-month period and one test per month during the final 6-month period).

(2) You may also require follow-up tests during the 48 months of safety-sensitive duty following this first 12-month period.

(3) You are not to establish the actual dates for the follow-up tests you prescribe. The decision on specific dates to test is the employer's.
