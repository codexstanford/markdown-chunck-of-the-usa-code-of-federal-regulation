###### Alternate phase-in standards.

(5)Manufacturers have the option to comply with EPA emissions standards for compression-ignition engine families using an alternative phase-in schedule that correlates with EPA's OBD standards. If a manufacturer chooses to use the alternative phase-in schedule for meeting EPA standards and optionally chooses to comply early with the NHTSA fuel consumption program, it must use the same phase-in schedule beginning in model year 2013 for fuel consumption standards and must remain in the program for each model year thereafter until model year 2020. The fuel consumption standard for each model year of the alternative phase-in schedule is provided in Table 15 of this section. Note that engine families certified to these standards are not eligible for early credits under ยง 535.7.
