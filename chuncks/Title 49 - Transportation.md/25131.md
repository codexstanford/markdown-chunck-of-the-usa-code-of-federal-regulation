##### Subpart U - ES-2re Side Impact Crash Test Dummy, 50th Percentile Adult Male
###### ยง 572.185 Thorax (upper torso) assembly.
####### Test Procedure.

(1)(i) Soak the dummy assembly (175-0000), with struck-side arm (175-3500, left arm; 175-3800, right arm), shoulder foam pad (175-3010), and neoprene body suit (175-8000) removed, in a test environment as specified in ยง 572.189(n);

(ii) The dummy is seated, as shown in Figure U4 in appendix A to this subpart, on a flat, horizontal, rigid surface covered by two overlaid 2 mm thick Teflon sheets and with no back support of the dummy's torso. The dummy's torso spine backplate is vertical within +/-2 degrees and the midsagittal plane of thorax is positioned perpendicular to the direction of the plane of motion of the impactor at contact with the thorax. The non-struck side arm is oriented vertically, pointing downward. The dummy's legs are horizontal and symmetrical about the midsagittal plane with the distance between the innermost point on the opposite ankle at 100 +/-5 mm;

(iii) The impactor is the same as defined in ยง 572.189(a);

(iv) The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the thorax its longitudinal axis is within +/-0.5 degrees of horizontal and perpendicular +/-0.5 degrees to the midsagittal plane of the dummy and the centerpoint of the impactor's face is within 5 mm of the impact point on the dummy's middle rib shown in Figure U4 in appendix A to this subpart;

(v) The impactor impacts the dummy's thorax at 5.5 m/s +/-0.1 m/s.

(vi) Time zero is defined in ยง 572.189(k).
