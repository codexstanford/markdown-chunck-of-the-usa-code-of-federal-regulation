###### ยง 572.122 Head assembly and test procedure.

(a) The head assembly for this test consists of the complete head (drawing 127-1000), a six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) or its structural replacement (drawing 78051-383X), a head to neck-to-pivot pin (drawing 78051-339), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4).

(b) When the head assembly in paragraph (a) of this section is dropped from a height of 376.0 +/-1.0 mm (14.8 +/-0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration at the location of the accelerometers at the head CG may not be less than 245 G or more than 300 G. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal; oscillations occurring after the main pulse must be less than 10 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed 15 g's (zero to peak).
