####### Procedure.

S6.5.4.2(a) Mix 30 +/-1 ml. of the brake fluid with 30 +/-1 ml. of SAE RM-66-04 Compatibility Fluid in a boiling point flask (S6.1.2(a)). Determine the initial ERBP of the mixture by applying heat to the flask so that the fluid is refluxing in 10 +/-2 minutes at a rate in excess of 1 drop per second, but not more than 5 drops per second. Note the maximum fluid temperature observed during the first minute after the fluid begins refluxing at a rate in excess of 1 drop per second. Over the next 15 +/-1 minutes, adjust and maintain the reflux rate at 1 to 2 drops per second. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, recording the average value of four temperature readings taken at 30 second intervals as the final ERBP.

(b) Thermometer and barometric corrections are not required.
