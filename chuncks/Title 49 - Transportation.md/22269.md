####### Brake power.

S5.4.2When mounted on an inertia dynamometer, each brake shall be capable of making 10 consecutive decelerations at an average rate of 9 f.p.s.p.s. from 50 m.p.h. to 15 m.p.h., at equal intervals of 72 seconds, and shall be capable of decelerating to a stop from 20 m.p.h. at an average deceleration rate of 14 f.p.s.p.s. 1 minute after the 10th deceleration. The series of decelerations shall be conducted as follows:

S5.4.2.1 With an initial brake temperature between 150 &#xB0;F. and 200 &#xB0;F. for the first brake application, and the drum or disc rotating at a speed equivalent to 50 m.p.h., apply the brake and decelerate at an average deceleration rate of 9 f.p.s.p.s. to 15 m.p.h. Upon reaching 15 m.p.h., accelerate to 50 m.p.h. and apply the brake for a second time 72 seconds after the start of the first application. Repeat the cycle until 10 decelerations have been made. The service line air pressure shall not exceed 100 psi during any deceleration.

S5.4.2.2 One minute after the end of the last deceleration required by S5.4.2.1 and with the drum or disc rotating at a speed of 20 m.p.h., decelerate to a stop at an average deceleration rate of 14 f.p.s.p.s.
