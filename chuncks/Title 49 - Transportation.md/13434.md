## Subtitle B - Other Regulations Relating to Transportation
### Chapter II - Federal Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation
#### PART 238 - PASSENGER EQUIPMENT SAFETY STANDARDS
##### Subpart C - Specific Requirements for Tier I Passenger Equipment
###### § 238.201 Scope/alternative compliance.
####### Alternative compliance.

(b)(1) Passenger equipment of special design shall be deemed to comply with this subpart, other than § 238.203, for the service environment the petitioner proposes to operate the equipment in if the Associate Administrator determines under paragraph (c) of this section that the equipment provides at least an equivalent level of safety in such environment for the protection of its occupants from serious injury in the case of a derailment or collision. In making a determination under paragraph (c) the Associate Administrator shall consider, as a whole, all of those elements of casualty prevention or mitigation relevant to the integrity of the equipment that are addressed by the requirements of this subpart.

(2)(i) Tier I passenger trainsets may comply with the alternative crashworthiness and occupant protection requirements in appendix G to this part instead of the requirements in §§ 238.203, 238.205, 238.207, 238.209(a), 238.211, 238.213, and 238.219.

(ii) To assess compliance with the alternative requirements, the railroad shall submit the following documents to the Associate Administrator, for review:

(A) Test plans, and supporting documentation for all tests intended to demonstrate compliance with the alternative requirements and to validate any computer modeling and analysis used, including notice of such tests, 30 days before commencing the tests; and

(B) A carbody crashworthiness and occupant protection compliance report based on the analysis, calculations, and test data necessary to demonstrate compliance.

(iii) The carbody crashworthiness and occupant protection compliance report shall be deemed acceptable unless the Associate Administrator stays action by written notice to the railroad within 60 days after receipt of the report.

(A) If the Associate Administrator stays action, the railroad shall correct any deficiencies FRA identified and notify FRA it has corrected the deficiencies before placing the subject equipment into service.

(B) FRA may also impose written conditions necessary for safely operating the equipment, for cause stated.

(c)(1) The Associate Administrator may only make a finding of equivalent safety and compliance with this subpart, other than § 238.203, based upon a submission of data and analysis sufficient to support that determination. The petition shall include:

(i) The information required by § 238.21(c);

(ii) Information, including detailed drawings and materials specifications, sufficient to describe the actual construction of the equipment of special design;

(iii) Engineering analysis sufficient to describe the likely performance of the equipment in derailment and collision scenarios pertinent to the safety requirements for which compliance is required and for which the equipment does not conform to the specific requirements of this subpart; and

(iv) A quantitative risk assessment, incorporating the design information and engineering analysis described in this paragraph, demonstrating that the equipment, as utilized in the service environment for which recognition is sought, presents no greater hazard of serious personal injury than equipment that conforms to the specific requirements of this subpart.

(2) Any petition made under this paragraph is subject to the procedures set forth in § 238.21, and will be disposed of in accordance with § 238.21(g).
