######## Motion for decision.

(5)A party may move for decision, regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the ALJ has issued an initial decision in the proceedings. A party may include with a motion for decision affidavits as well as any other evidence in support of the motion. The ALJ must grant a party's motion for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits, matters that the ALJ has officially noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party moving for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact.
