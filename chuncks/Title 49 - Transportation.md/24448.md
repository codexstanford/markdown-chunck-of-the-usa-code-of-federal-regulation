####### Ground Clearance Measurement.

S6.9

(a) For the test device attached to a complete trailer as specified in S6.2 of this section, the ground clearance of the guard at the vertical supports to which the horizontal member is attached shall be measured after completion of the uniform distributed load test in accordance with S6.6(b) or S6.6(c) of this section.

(b) For the test device attached to a rigid test fixture as specified in S6.2 of this section, the vertical distance from the ground to the bottom edge of the horizontal member at the vertical supports to which the horizontal member is attached shall be measured after completion of the uniform distributed load test in accordance with S6.6(b) or S6.6(c) of this section and subtracted from the corresponding ground clearance measured before the load application in accordance with S6.5(c) of this section. The difference in ground clearance before and after the load application is added to the allowable maximum vertical distance between the bottom edge of the horizontal member of the guard and the ground as specified in S5.5(c) of this section, to obtain the ground clearance after completion of the uniform distributed load test.
