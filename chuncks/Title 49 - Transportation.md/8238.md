####### ยง 192.917 How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and use the threat identification in its integrity program?
######## Third party damage.

(1)An operator must utilize the data integration required in paragraph (b) of this section and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A7 to determine the susceptibility of each covered segment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies the threat of third party damage, the operator must implement comprehensive additional preventive measures in accordance with ยง 192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in conducting a baseline assessment under ยง 192.921, or a reassessment under ยง 192.937, an operator uses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must integrate data from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign line crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment. An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data integration.
