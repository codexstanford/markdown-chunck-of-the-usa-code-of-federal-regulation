####### Provisions for simultaneous and sequential testing.

S6.3.3(a) In the case of vehicle seat assemblies equipped with more than one tether anchorage system, the force referred to in S6.3.1 and S6.3.2 may, at the agency's option, be applied simultaneously to each of those tether anchorages. However, that force may not be applied simultaneously to tether anchorages for any two adjacent seating positions whose midpoints are less than 400 mm apart, as measured in accordance with S6.3.3(a)(1) and (2) and Figure 20.

(1) The midpoint of the seating position lies in the vertical longitudinal plane that is equidistant from vertical longitudinal planes through the geometric center of each of the two lower anchorages at the seating position. For those seating positions that do not provide lower anchorages, the midpoint of the seating position lies in the vertical longitudinal plane that passes through the SgRP of the seating position.

(2) Measure the distance between the vertical longitudinal planes passing through the midpoints of the adjacent seating positions, as measured along a line perpendicular to the planes.

(b) A tether anchorage of a particular child restraint anchorage system will not be tested with the lower anchorages of that anchorage system if one or both of those lower anchorages have been previously tested under this standard.

S6.3.4 Subject to subsections S6.3.4.1 and S6.3.4.2, every user-ready tether anchorage in a row of designated seating positions shall, when tested, withstand the application of a force of 10,000 N-

(a) Applied by means of one of the following types of test devices, installed as a child restraint system would be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions, namely,

(1) SFAD 1, to test a tether anchorage at a designated seating position that does not have a child restraint anchorage system; or

(2) SFAD 2, to test a tether anchorage at a designated seating position that has a child restraint anchorage system;

(b) Applied-

(1) In a forward direction parallel to the vehicle's vertical longitudinal plane through the X point on the test device, and,

(2) Initially, along a horizontal line or along any line below or above that line that is at an angle to that line of not more than 5 degrees;

(c) Approximately linearly over a time, at the option of the vehicle manufacturer, of not more than 30 seconds, at any onset force rate of not more than 135 000 N/s; and

(d) Maintained at a 10,000 N level for one second.

S6.3.4.1 In a passenger car manufactured before September 1, 2004, every user-ready tether anchorage in a row of designated seating positions must, when tested, subject to subsection S6.3.4.2, withstand the application of a force of 5,300 N, which force must be-

(a) Applied by means of a belt strap that-

(1) Extends not less than 250 mm forward from the vertical plane touching the rear top edge of the vehicle seat back,

(2) Is fitted at one end with suitable hardware for applying the force and at the other end with a bracket for the attachment of the user-ready tether anchorage, and

(3) Passes over the top of the vehicle seat back as shown in Figure 19 of this standard;

(b) Applied-

(1) In a forward direction parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal vertical plane, and

(2) Initially, along a horizontal line or along any line below that line that is at an angle to that line of not more than 20 degrees;

(c) Attained within 30 seconds, at any onset force rate of not more than 135,000 N/s; and

(d) Maintained at a 5,300 N level for one second.

S6.3.4.2 If the zones in which tether anchorages are located overlap and if, in the overlap area, a user-ready tether anchorage is installed that is designed to accept the tether strap hooks of two restraint systems simultaneously, both portions of the tether anchorage that are designed to bind with a tether strap hook shall withstand the force referred to in subsection S6.3.4 or S6.3.4.1, as the case may be, applied to both portions simultaneously.
