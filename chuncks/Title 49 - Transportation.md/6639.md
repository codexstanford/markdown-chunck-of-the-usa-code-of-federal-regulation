######## Weld joint efficiency.

(iv)The lower value of stress at failure attained in the two tensile test specimens shall be used to compute the efficiency of the joint as follows: Determine the failure ratio by dividing the stress at failure by the mechanical properties of the adjacent metal; this value, when multiplied by 0.75, is the design weld joint efficiency.

(10) The requirements of paragraph UW-9(d) in Section VIII of the ASME Code do not apply.
