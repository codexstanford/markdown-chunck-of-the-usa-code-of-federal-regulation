######## i.e.,

(i) Reduce the MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.1. The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during one continuous 30-day period. The reduced MAOP must account for differences between discharge and upstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest value for the entire pipeline segment or the operating pressure gradient (the location specific operating pressure at each location);

(ii) Conduct patrols in accordance with ยง 192.705 paragraphs (a) and (c) and conduct instrumented leakage surveys in accordance with ยง 192.706 at intervals not to exceed those in the following table 1 to ยง 192.624(c)(5)(ii):
