FMCSA's authority over interstate operations under the MCSA is in most ways even broader than the ICC's authority under the 1935 Act because it includes fewer statutory exemptions and is equally or more focused on highway safety. The Agency may, therefore, require compliance with the FMCSRs by passenger carriers with interstate operations no more extensive than those previously described inv.providing those operations are undertaken with CMVs, as defined in §§ 390.5T and 390.5.

A related question is whether relatively infrequent operations in interstate commerce make a motor carrier permanently subject to FMCSA jurisdiction. For an answer, we again look at the 1935 Act and to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) precedent. The FHWA, FMCSA's predecessor agency, said in a 1981 notice of interpretation that "[e]vidence of driving in interstate commerce or being subject to being used in interstate commerce should be accepted as proof that the driver is subject to [the hours-of-service requirements in 49 U.S.C. 31502(b)] for a 4-month period from the date of the proof" 46 FR 37902, 37903 (July 23, 1981).
