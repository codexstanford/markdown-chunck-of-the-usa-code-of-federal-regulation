### PART 40 - PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS
#### Appendix E to Part 40 - SAP Equivalency Requirements for Certification Organizations
##### Fifty State Coverage:

11.Certification must be available to qualified counselors in all 50 states and, therefore, the test must be available to qualified applicants in all 50 states.

The test need not be given in all 50 states but should be accessible to candidates from all states.
