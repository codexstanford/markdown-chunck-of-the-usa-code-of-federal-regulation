####### ยง 178.605 Hydrostatic pressure test.
######## i.e.

(1) Not less than the total gauge pressure measured in the packaging (, the vapor pressure of the filling material and the partial pressure of the air or other inert gas minus 100 kPa (15 psi)) at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5. This total gauge pressure must be determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling in accordance with ยง 173.24a(d) of this subchapter and a filling temperature of 15 &#xB0;C (59 &#xB0;F);

(2) Not less than 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig); or

(3) Not less than 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig).
