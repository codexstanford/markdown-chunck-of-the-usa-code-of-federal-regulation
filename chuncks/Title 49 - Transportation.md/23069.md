####### For example, the relative volume change between 10 km/h (11+/-1km/h) and 20 km/h (21+/-1km/h) would be the,level at 21+/-1km/h minus the,level at 11+/-1km/h.

S7.6.4 Calculate the relative volume change between critical operating scenarios (stationary to 10km/h; 10km/h to 20 km/h; 20km/h to 30 km/h) by subtracting the NORMALIZED BAND SUM of the lower speed operating scenario from the NORMALIZED BAND SUM of the next higher speed operating scenario.NORMALIZED BAND SUMNORMALIZED BAND SUM
