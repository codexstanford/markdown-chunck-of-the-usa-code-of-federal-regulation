(a)For the purpose of this subchapter, a(Division 2.1) means any material which is a gas at 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) or less and 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) of pressure (a material which has a boiling point of 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) or less at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia)) which-

(1) Is ignitable at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) when in a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air; or

(2) Has a flammable range at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) with air of at least 12 percent regardless of the lower limit. Except for aerosols, the limits specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be determined at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) of pressure and a temperature of 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F) in accordance with the ASTM E681-85, Standard Test Method for Concentration Limits of Flammability of Chemicals or other equivalent method approved by the Associate Administrator.
