##### Section 24.404(b) Basic rights of persons to be displaced.

This paragraph affirms the right of a 180-day homeowner-occupant, who is eligible for a replacement housing payment under ยง 24.401, to a reasonable opportunity to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling. However, it should be read in conjunction with the definition of "owner of a dwelling" at ยง 24.2(a)(20). The Agency is not required to provide persons owning only a fractional interest in the displacement dwelling a greater level of assistance to purchase a replacement dwelling than the Agency would be required to provide such persons if they owned fee simple title to the displacement dwelling. If such assistance is not sufficient to buy a replacement dwelling, the Agency may provide additional purchase assistance or rental assistance.
