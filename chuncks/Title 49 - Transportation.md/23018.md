S6.1.1.2

S6.1.1.2.1 Measure the section width and overall width by caliper at six points approximately equally spaced around the circumference of the tire, avoiding measurement of the additional thickness of the special protective ribs or bands. The average of the measurements so obtained are taken as the section width and overall width, respectively.

S6.1.1.2.2 Determine the outer diameter by measuring the maximum circumference of the tire and dividing the figure so obtained by Pi (3.14).
