##### Appendix D to Part 213 - Minimally Compliant Analytical Track (MCAT) Simulations Used for Qualifying Vehicles To Operate at High Speeds and at High Cant Deficiencies
###### Perturbation wavelength.

(ii)For each speed, a set of two separate MCAT simulations shall be performed. In each MCAT simulation for the perturbation segments described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (vii) and paragraph (b)(1)(ix) of this appendix, every perturbation shall have the same wavelength. The following two wavelengths, λ, shall be used: 31 and 62 feet. The short warp perturbation segment described in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this appendix has a fixed wavelength, λ, of 20 feet.
