(4) Establish and describe screening criteria to be used in selecting the eligible lines which the State analyzes in detail, identify these lines, and explain how the application of the screening criteria resulted in their selection;

(5) Describe the State's methodology for determining the ratio of benefits to the costs of proposed projects eligible under § 266.7 of this part (except projects to be funded with rail service continuation assistance);

(6) Include, to the extent that the information is available to the State, the following data for each line the State has selected to analyze in detail:

(i) Annual freight tonnage and carloads segregated by commodity type and indicating any seasonal traffic fluctuations and the number of shippers and receivers on the line aggregated by type (e.g., grain elevator, power plant, heavy manufacturing), including identification of information which a shipper wishes the Administrator to consider confidential to the extent permitted by law;

(ii) Revenues and costs of providing rail freight service on the line;

(iv) When the State is considering a line for rail service continuation assistance, projections of freight traffic needs on the line for at least the three succeeding calendar years and estimates of the amount and type of equipment, the condition of the rail facilities, and the level of service necessary to satisfy the projected traffic needs as well as estimates of the revenue and costs of providing this service; and

(v) When the State is considering a project eligible under § 266.7(b) of this part, the amount of funds expended for the maintenance of the line and the kinds of work performed during the five year period preceding its eligibility.

(7) Describe the alternatives which the State will analyze in applying the methodology described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, such as: Rail service continuation payments, rehabilitation or improvement, acquisition, rail facility construction, potential for moving freight by alternate modes, or abandonment or discontinuance of rail freight service;

(8) Apply the methodology described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section to each line the State has selected to analyze in detail;

(9) Specify the State's decision regarding the alternative selected for each line the State has analyzed in detail and include the following:
