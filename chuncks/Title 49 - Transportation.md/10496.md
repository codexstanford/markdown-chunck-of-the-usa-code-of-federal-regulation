(e) The severity formulas answer the question, "What is the chance that a fatality (or casualty) will happen, given that a collision has occurred?" The fatality formula calculates the probability of a fatal collision given that a collision occurs (, the probability of a collision in which a fatality occurs) P(FC|C). Similarly, the casualty formula calculates the probability of a casualty collision given that a collision occurs P(CC|C). As casualties consist of both fatalities and injuries, the probability of a non-fatal injury collision is found by subtracting the probability of a fatal collision from the probability of a casualty collision. To convert the probability of a fatal or casualty collision to the number of expected fatal or casualty collisions, that probability is multiplied by the number of predicted collisions (PC).
