(i)A 1.8 m (5.9 feet) drop test onto an unyielding surface must be performed. There must be no leakage. Leakage must be determined using a soap bubble solution or other equivalent means on all possible leak locations, when the fuel cell cartridge is charged to its rated charging pressure. The fuel cell cartridge must then be hydrostatically pressurized to destruction. The burst pressure must be greater than 85% of the minimum shell burst pressure. The drop must be performed in the following four different orientations:

(A) Vertically, on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly;

(B) Vertically, on the end opposite to the shut-off valve assembly;

(C) Horizontally, onto a steel apex with a diameter of 3.8 cm (9.7 in), with the steel apex in the upward position; and

(D) At a 45&#xB0; angle on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly.
