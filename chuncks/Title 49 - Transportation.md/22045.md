####### SBR WC cups.

(b)Measure the base diameters of the two standard SBR cups, using an optical comparator or micrometer, to the nearest 0.02 mm. (0.001 inch) along the centerline of the SAE and rubber-type identifications and at right angles to this centerline. Take the measurements at least 0.4 mm. (0.015 inch) above the bottom edge and parallel to the base of the cup. Discard any cup if the two measured diameters differ by more than 0.08 mm. (0.003 inch). Average the two readings on each cup. Determine the hardness of the cups according to S7.4.
