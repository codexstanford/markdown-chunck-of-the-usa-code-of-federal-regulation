####### ยง 172.406 Placement of labels.
######## General.

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, each label required by this subpart must-

(i) Be printed on or affixed to a surface (other than the bottom) of the package or containment device containing the hazardous material;

(ii) Be located on the same surface of the package and near the proper shipping name marking, if the package dimensions are adequate; and

(iii) For transportation by aircraft, the entire label(s) must appear on one side of the package. For cylindrical packages, the label must be of such dimensions that it will not overlap itself. In the case of cylindrical packages containing radioactive materials, which require two identical labels, these labels must be centered on opposite points of the circumference and must not overlap each other. If the dimensions of the package are such that two identical labels cannot be affixed without overlapping each other, one label is acceptable provided it does not overlap itself.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, duplicate labeling is not required on a package or containment device (such as to satisfy redundant labeling requirements).
