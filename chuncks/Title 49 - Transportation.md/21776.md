####### Test procedure.

S5.3.2

S5.3.2.1 Force a 19 mm (inch) diameter cylindrical steel plunger with a hemispherical end perpendicularly into the tread rib as near to the centerline as possible, avoiding penetration into the tread groove, at the rate of 50 mm (2 inches) per minute.

S5.3.2.2 Record the force and penetration at five test points equally spaced around the circumference of the tire. If the tire fails to break before the plunger is stopped by reaching the rim, record the force and penetration as the rim is reached and use these values in S5.3.2.3.

S5.3.2.3 Compute the breaking energy for each test point by means of one of the two following formulas:

S5.3.2.4 Determine the breaking energy value for the tire by computing the average of the five values obtained in accordance with S5.3.2.3.
