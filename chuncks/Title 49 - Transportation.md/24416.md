####### Loading bar.

S6.5The loading bar is a rigid cylinder with an outside diameter of 152 mm that has hemispherical ends with radii of 76 mm and with a surface roughness that does not exceed 1.6 µm, root mean square. The length of the loading bar is 102 mm less than the width of the seat back in each test. The stroking mechanism applies force through a pivot attachment at the center point of the loading bar which allows the loading bar to rotate in a horizontal plane 30 degrees in either direction from the transverse position.

S6.5.1 A vertical or lateral force of 17,792 N applied externally through the pivot attachment point of the loading bar at any position reached during a test specified in this standard shall not deflect that point more than 25 mm.
