###### Administrative Support Operations

(5)subactivity refers to operations providing direct administrative support to the overall Transportation activity. It includes administrative support for the Common, and the Specialized Services Operations subactivities. The administrative support operations includes receiving and processing customer orders, requesting cars, preparing waybills, rating shipments, billing customers, collecting customer receivables in the ordinary course of business (not to include treasury, legal, general accounting, revenue accounting, or credit operations, all of which are chargeable to the General and Administrative activity), billing and recording demurrage, reporting interchanges, reporting advances, and the initial reporting and summarization of input documents for purposes of cash collection and accounting. Any operations beyond the initial summarization and reporting of input data are assignable to the General and Administrative activity except for those otherwise included in the definition of this subactivity.

Carrier staff, administrative, or clerical operations related to operating or transportation department general administration should not be charged to this subactivity. The Administrative Support Operations subactivity may be performed at local stations, regional offices, or even at the general offices; however, the location of the operation performance does not affect its nature. The operations included in this subactivity should reasonably correlate to the quantity of shipments or to the quantity of carloadings.
