######## Cargo tank motor vehicle safety check.

(m)Before unloading from a cargo tank motor vehicle containing a liquefied compressed gas, the qualified person performing the function must check those components of the discharge system, including delivery hose assemblies and piping, that are readily observed during the normal course of unloading to assure that they are of sound quality, without obvious defects detectable through visual observation and audio awareness, and that connections are secure. This check must be made after the pressure in the discharge system has reached at least equilibrium with the pressure in the cargo tank. Operators need not use instruments or take extraordinary actions to check components not readily visible. No operator may unload liquefied compressed gases from a cargo tank motor vehicle with a delivery hose assembly found to have any condition identified in ยง 180.416(g)(1) of this subchapter or with piping systems found to have any condition identified in ยง 180.416(g)(2) of this subchapter.
