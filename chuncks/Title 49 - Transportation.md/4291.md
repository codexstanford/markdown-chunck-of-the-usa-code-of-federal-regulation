(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the evolved gases are not poisonous, likely to create a flammable mixture with air or be an asphyxiant under normal conditions of transportation;

(3) The packaging is designed so as to preclude an unintentional release of hazardous materials from the receptacle;

(4) For bulk packagings, other than IBCs, venting is authorized for the specific hazardous material by a special provision in the ยง 172.101 table or by the applicable bulk packaging specification in part 178 of this subchapter; and

(5) Intermediate bulk packagings (IBCs) may be vented when required to reduce internal pressure that may develop by the evolution of gas subject to the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this section. The IBC must be of a type that has successfully passed (with the vent in place) the applicable design qualification tests with no release of hazardous material.
