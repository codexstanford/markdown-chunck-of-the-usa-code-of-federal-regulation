####### ยง 192.620 Alternative maximum allowable operating pressure for certain steel pipelines.
######## When may an operator use the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure calculated under paragraph (a) of this section?

(b)An operator may use an alternative maximum allowable operating pressure calculated under paragraph (a) of this section if the following conditions are met:

(1) The pipeline segment is in a Class 1, 2, or 3 location;

(2) The pipeline segment is constructed of steel pipe meeting the additional design requirements in ยง 192.112;

(3) A supervisory control and data acquisition system provides remote monitoring and control of the pipeline segment. The control provided must include monitoring of pressures and flows, monitoring compressor start-ups and shut-downs, and remote closure of valves per paragraph (d)(3) of this section;

(4) The pipeline segment meets the additional construction requirements described in ยง 192.328;

(5) The pipeline segment does not contain any mechanical couplings used in place of girth welds;

(6) If a pipeline segment has been previously operated, the segment has not experienced any failure during normal operations indicative of a systemic fault in material as determined by a root cause analysis, including metallurgical examination of the failed pipe. The results of this root cause analysis must be reported to each PHMSA pipeline safety regional office where the pipeline is in service at least 60 days prior to operation at the alternative MAOP. An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that State; and

(7) At least 95 percent of girth welds on a segment that was constructed prior to December 22, 2008, must have been non-destructively examined in accordance with ยง 192.243(b) and (c).
