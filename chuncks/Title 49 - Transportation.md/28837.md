######## ad valorem

(3) In states where themethod is not employed, applicant must describe the applicable property tax methodology if it is claiming the local property tax as an avoidable cost of operations. Additionally, it must substantiate with evidence and computations the actual statewide tax savings attributable to the abandonment.

(4) Any property tax properly substantiated under paragraphs (j)(2) or (3) of this section shall be presumed to represent systemwide savings to the carrier. Protestants may rebut this presumption by presenting evidence:

(i) That property taxes in those states where the carrier operates that are not involved in the abandonment will increase significantly because of reassessments attributable to the abandonment; or

(ii) That a significantly higher property tax will be levied against a retained portion of the abandoned property. If applicant does not refute protestant's evidence, it may claim avoidable property taxes only if, and to the extent, it proves systemwide property tax savings.

(5) In states where real property taxes are assessed and levied against the owner of the property but the tax on rolling stock is assessed to the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula of a statewide valuation of property, the tax on rolling stock attributable to each line segment shall be determined as follows:

(i) Using ratio of the cost of equipment (as used in the formula) to the total of all property costs (as used in formula);

(ii) Apply that ratio to the total state assessment to determine the portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;

(iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each line segment on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the segment to total car and locomotive unit miles in the state; and

(iv) Apply the appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated assessment thus determined.
