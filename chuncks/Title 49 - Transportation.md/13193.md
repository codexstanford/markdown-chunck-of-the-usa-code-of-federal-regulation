####### Crash energy management

means an approach to the design of rail passenger equipment which controls the dissipation of energy during a collision to protect the occupied volumes from crushing and to limit the decelerations on passengers and crewmembers in those volumes. This may be accomplished by designing energy-absorbing structures of low strength in the unoccupied volumes of a rail vehicle or passenger train to collapse in a controlled manner, while providing higher structural strength in the occupied volumes. Energy deflection can also be part of a crash energy management approach. Crash energy management can be used to help provide anti-climbing resistance and to reduce the risk of train buckling during a collision.
