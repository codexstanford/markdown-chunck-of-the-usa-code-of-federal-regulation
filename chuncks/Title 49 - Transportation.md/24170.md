The H-points of each test dummy coincide within 12.7 mm (inch) in the vertical dimension and 12.7 mm (inch) in the horizontal dimension of a point that is located 6.4 mm (inch) below the position of the H-point determined by using the equipment for the 50th percentile and procedures specified in SAE Standard J826-1980 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5), except that Table 1 of SAE J826-1980 is not applicable. The length of the lower leg and thigh segments of the H-point machine are adjusted to 414 and 401 mm (16.3 and 15.8 inches), respectively.
