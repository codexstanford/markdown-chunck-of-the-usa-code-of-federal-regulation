S14.9.2.1

S14.9.2.1.1 The sample unit is operated at its rated voltage with the maximum bulb load it will experience on the vehicle on which it will be installed. Bulbs that fail during the test are replaced. The hazard warning signal flasher is not to be included in the test circuit.

S14.9.2.1.2 The unit is turned "on" and "off" in its normal operating manner at a rate not to exceed 15 complete cycles per minute. One complete cycle consists of the sequence: Off, on, and return to off. The test consists of 10,000 cycles at an ambient temperature of 75&#xB0; +/-10 &#xB0;F followed by 1 hour constant "on" at the same temperature.

S14.9.2.1.3 The voltage drop from the input terminal of the device to each lamp output terminal, including 3 in of 16 or 18 gage wire, is measured at the start of the test and at the completion of the test.
