S14.9.3.5.2

S14.9.3.5.2.1 The test is conducted using the standard test circuit with the design load (variable load flashers are tested with their minimum and their maximum design load) connected and design voltage applied to the bulbs.

S14.9.3.5.2.2 Compliance is determined using the following combinations of ambient temperature and bulb voltage:

(a) 12.8 volts (or 6.4 volts) and 75&#xB0; +/-10 &#xB0;F,

(b) 12.0 volts (or 6.0 volts) and 0&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F,

(c) 15.0 volts (or 7.5 volts) and 0&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F,

(d) 11.0 volts (or 5.5 volts) and 125&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F, and

(e) 14.0 volts (or 7.0 volts) and 125&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F.

S14.9.3.5.2.3 Flash rate and percent current "on" time are measured after the flashers have completed five consecutive cycles and are determined by an average of at least three consecutive cycles.
