###### Rating authority for production or construction equipment.

(b)(1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on FORM BIS-999. (See 15 CFR 700.51).

(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.
