######## Heat treatment.

(e)Each completed cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to testing, as follows:

(1) Each cylinder must be heated and held at the proper temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder and then quenched in a suitable liquid medium having a cooling rate not in excess of 80 percent of water. The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but it must never exceed 1750 &#xB0;F.

(2) After quenching, each cylinder must be reheated to a temperature below the transformation range but not less than 1050 &#xB0;F., and must be held at this temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder. Each cylinder must then be cooled under conditions recommended for the steel.
