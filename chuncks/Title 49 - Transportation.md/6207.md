######## Lot testing.

(2)(i) Cylinders with a wall stress of 18,000 psig or less may be lot tested. At least one (1) cylinder randomly selected out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested by the water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1. The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

(ii) Each selected cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

(iii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.

(iv) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 12 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
