(1) A baseline test based on the dry stop test-single brake control actuated (S6.3).

(2) A single wet brake stop using the same test parameters as in (1), but with the brake(s) being continuously sprayed with water while the test is conducted in order to measure the brakes' performance in wet conditions.

(b) The test is not applicable to parking brake systems unless it is the secondary brake.

(c) Drum brakes or fully enclosed disc brakes are excluded from this test unless ventilation or open inspection ports are present.

(d) This test requires the vehicle to be fitted with instrumentation that gives a continuous recording of brake control force and vehicle deceleration.
