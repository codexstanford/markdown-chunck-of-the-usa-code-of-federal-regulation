####### Thermocouples.

2.2At least three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature inside the oven and an additional three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature of the cylinder. The thermocouples must beinch, ceramic packed, metal sheathed, type K (Chromel-Alumel), grounded junction with a nominal 30 American wire gauge (AWG) size conductor. The thermocouples measuring the temperature inside the oven must be placed at varying heights to ensure even temperature and proper heat-soak conditions. For the thermocouples measuring the temperature of the cylinder: (1) Two of them must be placed on the outer cylinder side wall at approximately 2 inches (5 cm) from the top and bottom shoulders of the cylinder; and (2) one must be placed on the cylinder valve body near the pressure relief device. Alternatively, the thermocouples may be replaced with other devices such as a remote temperature sensor, metal fuse on the valve, or coated wax, provided the device is tested and the test report is retained for verification. Under this alternative, it is permissible to record the highest temperature to which the cylinder is subjected instead of temperature measurements in intervals of not more than five (5) minutes.
