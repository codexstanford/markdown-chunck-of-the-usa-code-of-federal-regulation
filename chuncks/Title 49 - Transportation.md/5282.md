######## Penetration test.

(e)For the penetration test, the specimen must be placed on a rigid, flat, horizontal surface that will not move significantly while the test is being performed.

(1) A bar of 3.2 cm (1.25 inches) in diameter with a hemispherical end and a mass of 6 kg (13.2 pounds) must be dropped and directed to fall with its longitudinal axis vertical, onto the center of the weakest part of the specimen, so that, if it penetrates far enough, it will hit the containment system. The bar may not be significantly deformed by the test; and

(2) The height of the drop of the bar measured from its lower end to the intended point of impact on the upper surface of the specimen must be 1 m (3.3 feet) or greater.
