####### Flexion.

(1)(i) Plane D referenced in Figure R3 of this subpart shall rotate in the direction of pre-impact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline not less than 75 degrees and not more than 86 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak positive moment about the occipital condyles shall be not less than 36 N-m (26.6 ft-lbf) and not more than 45 N-m (33.2 ft-lbf).

(ii) The positive moment about the occipital condyles shall decay for the first time to 5 N-m (3.7 ft-lbf) between 60 ms and 80 ms after time zero.

(iii) The moment about the occipital condyles shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My - (0.005842m) x (Fx), where My is the moment about the y-axis, Fx is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572 -S23) and 0.005842m is the distance from the point at which the load cell measures the force to the occipital condyle.
