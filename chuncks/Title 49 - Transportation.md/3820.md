######## Watt-hour (Wh)

means a unit of energy equivalent to one watt (1 W) of work acting for one hour (1 h) of time. The Watt-hour rating of a lithium ion cell or battery is determined by multiplying the rated capacity of a cell or battery in ampere-hours, by its nominal voltage. Therefore, Watt-hour (Wh) = ampere-hour (Ah) x volts (V).
