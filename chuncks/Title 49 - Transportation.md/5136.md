(3)A non-DOT specification cargo tank (nurse tank) securely mounted on a field truck is authorized under the following conditions:

(i) The tank is in conformance with all the requirements of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, except that the requirement in paragraph (m)(1)(vi) does not apply;

(ii) The tank is inspected and tested in accordance with subpart E of part 180 of this subchapter as specified for an MC 331 cargo tank;

(iii) The tank is restricted to rural roads in areas within 50 miles of the fertilizer distribution point where the nurse tank is loaded; and

(iv) For the purposes of this section, a field truck means a vehicle on which a nurse tank is mounted that is designed to withstand off-road driving on hilly terrain. Specifically, the vehicle must be outfitted with stiffer suspension (for example, additional springs or airbags) than would be necessary for a comparable on-road vehicle, a rear axle ratio that provides greater low end torque, and a braking system and tires designed to ensure stability in hilly terrain. The field truck must have low annual over-the-road mileage and be used exclusively for agricultural purposes.
