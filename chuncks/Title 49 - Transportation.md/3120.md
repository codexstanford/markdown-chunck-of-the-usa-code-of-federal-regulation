######## Waiver of Preemption

means a decision by the Associate Administrator to forego preemption of a non-Federal requirement-that is, to allow a State, political subdivision or Indian tribe requirement to remain in effect. The non-Federal requirement must provide at least as much public protection as the Federal hazardous materials transportation law and the regulations issued under Federal hazardous materials transportation law, and may not unreasonably burden commerce.
