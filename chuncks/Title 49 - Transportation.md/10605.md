##### ยง 225.5 Definitions.
###### e.g.,

(2) A minimum of one calendar day if a PLHCP, for reasons associated with the employee's condition, recommends in writing that the employee take one or more days away from work, but the employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she been scheduled). This paragraph is intended to take into account "covered data" cases and also those non-covered data cases that are independently reportable for some other reason ("medical treatment" or "day of restricted work activity"). The requirement to report "a minimum of one calendar day" is intended to give a railroad the discretion to report up to the total number of days recommended by the PLHCP.
