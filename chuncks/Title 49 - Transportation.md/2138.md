##### 9. Dedicated vehicles or special equipment in a vehicle.,e.g.,,e.g.,,e.g.,

A paratransit passenger's request for special equipment (the installation of specific hand rails or a front seat in a vehicle for the passenger to avoid nausea or back pain) can be denied so long as the requested equipment is not required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Department's rules. Likewise, a request for a dedicated vehicle (to avoid residual chemical odors) or a specific type or appearance of vehicle (a sedan rather than a van, in order to provide more comfortable service) can be denied. In all of these cases, the Department views meeting the request as involving a fundamental alteration of the provider's service.
