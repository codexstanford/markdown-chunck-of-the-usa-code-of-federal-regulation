(a)(1) If the responsible Departmental official finds that a qualified person with a disability has been excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity in violation of this part, the recipient shall take such remedial action as the responsible Departmental official deems necessary to overcome the effects of the violation.

(i) With respect to persons with a disability who are no longer participants in the recipient's program or activity but who were participants in the program or activity when such discrimination occurred, and

(ii) With respect to persons with a disability who would have been participants in the program or activity had the discrimination not occurred.
