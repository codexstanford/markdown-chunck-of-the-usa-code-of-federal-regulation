####### Analysis of work schedules.

(a)Each railroad subject to this subpart must perform an analysis of one cycle of the work schedules (the period within which the work schedule repeats) of its train employees engaged in commuter or intercity rail passenger transportation and identify those work schedules intended to be assigned to its train employees, that, if worked by such a train employee, put the train employee at risk for a level of fatigue at which safety may be compromised. Schedules identified in paragraph (g) of this section do not have to be analyzed. A level of fatigue at which safety may be compromised, hereafter called "the fatigue threshold," shall be determined by procedures that use a scientifically valid, biomathematical model of human performance and fatigue that has been approved by the Associate Administrator pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or previously accepted pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each work schedule that violates the fatigue threshold must be-

(1) Reported to the Associate Administrator as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no later than April 12, 2012;

(2) Either-

(i) Mitigated by action in compliance with the railroad's fatigue mitigation plan that has been approved by the Associate Administrator as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, no later than April 12, 2012; or

(ii) Supported by a determination that the schedule is operationally necessary, and that the fatigue risk cannot be sufficiently mitigated by the use of fatigue mitigation tools to reduce the risk for fatigue to a level that does not violate the fatigue threshold, no later than April 12, 2012; or

(iii) Both, no later than April 12, 2012; and

(3) Approved by FRA for use in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
