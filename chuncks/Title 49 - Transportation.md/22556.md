####### Partial service brake system test.

S7.8.2Alter the service brake system on three-wheeled motorcycles to induce a complete loss of braking in any one subsystem. Determine the line pressure or pedal force necessary to cause the brake system failure indicator to operate. Make six stops from 30 m.p.h. and then six stops from 60 m.p.h. with an initial brake temperature between 130 &#xB0;F. and 150 &#xB0;F. Repeat for each subsystem. Determine that the brake failure indicator is operating when the master cylinder fluid level is less than the level specified in S5.1.3.1(a)(2), and that it complies with S5.1.3.1(c). Check for proper operation with each reservoir in turn at a low level. Restore the service brake system to normal at completion of this test.
