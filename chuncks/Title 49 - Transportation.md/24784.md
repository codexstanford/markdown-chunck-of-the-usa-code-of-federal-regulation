####### Test method to determine voltage between exposed conductive parts of electrical protection barriers and the electrical chassis and between exposed conductive parts of electrical protection barriers.

S9.3

(a) Connect the voltmeter to the measuring points (exposed conductive part of an electrical protection barrier and the electrical chassis or any two simultaneously reachable exposed conductive parts of electrical protection barriers that are less than 2.5 meters from each other).

(b) Measure the voltage.

(c) The voltage between two simultaneously reachable exposed conductive parts of electrical protection barriers that are less than 2.5 meters from each other may be calculated using the separately measured voltages between the relevant electrical protection barriers and the electrical chassis.
