####### ยง 195.419 Valve capabilities.
######## Flow modeling for automatic shut-off valves.

(f)Prior to using an ASV as an RMV, the operator must conduct flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's procedures, and in accordance with ยง 195.2 and this section. The flow modeling must include the anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that may be encountered during the year, not to exceed a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the flow between the RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide receipt tie-ins. If operating conditions change that could affect the ASV set pressures and the 30-minute valve closure time following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at ยง 195.2, an operator must conduct a new flow model and reset the ASV set pressures prior to the next review for ASV set pressures in accordance with ยง 195.420. The flow model must include a time/pressure chart for the segment containing the ASV if a rupture event occurs. An operator must conduct this flow modeling prior to making flow condition changes in a manner that could render the 30-minute valve closure time unachievable.
