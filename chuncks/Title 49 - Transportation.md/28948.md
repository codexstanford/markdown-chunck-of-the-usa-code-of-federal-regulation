###### Subpart B - Procedures Governing Petitions To Require a Facility in Existence on October 16, 2008, To Apply for a Land-Use-Exemption Permit
####### ยง 1155.12 Participation in petition proceedings.

(a) An interested person may file a reply to the petition challenging any of the information contained in the petition that is required by 49 CFR 1155.10(c) through (e) and may offer evidence to support its contention. The petitioner will have an opportunity to file a rebuttal.

(b) A facility can acknowledge that it was a solid waste rail transfer facility on October 16, 2008, but no longer operates as such and therefore is not required to seek a land-use-exemption permit. To do so, a facility must file with the Board a certification stating that it:

(1) No longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility;

(2) Understands that by certifying that it no longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility, it no longer qualifies as a facility in existence on October 16, 2008 for purposes of the Clean Railroad Act and these regulations; and

(3) Understands that if it seeks a land-use-exemption permit in the future, it would be required to do so as a proposed facility.
