FHWA replaced the 4-month rule with a 14/15-day "rule" in 1999. (More information about this matter can be found in Question 24 under regulatory guidance for ยง 390.3 on the FMCSA website,.) However, the Agency's Acting Deputy Administrator explained in a letter of August 21, 2001, to the Department of Labor that "[t]he 14/15-day rule is a prudential limitation on the use of FMCSA authority, not an interpretation of FMCSA jurisdiction." The letter also noted that "[b]ecause most of the case law interpreting the provisions of the [1935 Act] has been generated by Fair Labor Standards Act litigation, the courts have dealt only with agency authority to enforce the hours of service limits. The [1935 Act], however, authorizes regulations addressing a wider variety of safety problems, and we believe that the jurisdictional principles set forth by the courts would apply to them as well,to the medical qualifications of drivers."

FMCSA takes this occasion to reaffirm the view expressed in the Acting Deputy Administrator's 2001 letter that the Agency has jurisdiction over motor carriers, vehicles, and drivers for a 4-month period after a trip in interstate commerce. However, records must be retained for whatever period is required by the FMCSRs, even if that period exceeds 4 months.
