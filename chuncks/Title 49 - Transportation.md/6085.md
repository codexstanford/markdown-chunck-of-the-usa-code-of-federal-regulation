######## Wall thickness.

(f)The minimum wall thickness of the cylinder must be such that the calculated wall stress at the minimum required test pressure may not exceed the least value of the following:

(1) 45,000 psi.

(2) One-half of the minimum tensile strength across the welded seam determined in paragraph (l) of this section.

(3) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the base metal determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section.

(4) The yield strength of the base metal determined as required in paragraph (l) of this section.

(5) Further provided that wall stress for cylinders having longitudinal seams may not exceed 85 percent of the above value, whichever applies.

(6) Calculation must be made by the following formula:
