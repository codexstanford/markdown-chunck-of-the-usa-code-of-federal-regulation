(2)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure O2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 99 degrees and 114 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA5572-S11), about the occipital condyles shall be not more than -53 N-m (-39 ft-lbf) and not less than -65 N-m (-48 ft-lbf). The negative moment shall decay for the first time to -10 N-m (-7.4 ft-lbf) between 94 ms and 114 ms after time zero.

(ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = M- (0.01778m) x (F).

(iii) Mis the moment about the y-axis, Fis the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), and 0.01778 m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.

(3) Time-zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material. All data channels shall be at the zero level at this time.
