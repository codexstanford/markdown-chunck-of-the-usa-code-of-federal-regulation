####### ยง 192.617 Investigation of failures and incidents.
######## Analysis of rupture and valve shut-offs.

(c)If an incident on an onshore gas transmission pipeline or a Type A gathering pipeline involves the closure of a rupture-mitigation valve (RMV), as defined in ยง 192.3, or the closure of alternative equivalent technology, the operator of the pipeline must also conduct a post-incident analysis of all of the factors that may have impacted the release volume and the consequences of the incident and identify and implement operations and maintenance measures to prevent or minimize the consequences of a future incident. The requirements of this paragraph (c) are not applicable to distribution pipelines or Types B and C gas gathering pipelines. The analysis must include all relevant factors impacting the release volume and consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:

(1) Detection, identification, operational response, system shut-off, and emergency response communications, based on the type and volume of the incident;

(2) Appropriateness and effectiveness of procedures and pipeline systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), communications, valve shut-off, and operator personnel;

(3) Actual response time from identifying a rupture following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at ยง 192.3, to initiation of mitigative actions and isolation of the pipeline segment, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the mitigative actions taken;

(4) Location and timeliness of actuation of RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies; and

(5) All other factors the operator deems appropriate.
