## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Transportation
### PART 40 - PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS
#### Subpart K - Testing Sites, Forms, Equipment and Supplies Used in Alcohol Testing
##### ยง 40.227 May employers use the ATF for non-DOT tests, or non-DOT forms for DOT tests?
###### e.g.,

(b) If the STT or BAT, either by mistake, or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (post-accident test with insufficient time to obtain the ATF), uses a non-DOT form for a DOT test, the use of a non-DOT form does not, in and of itself, require the employer or service agent to cancel the test. However, in order for the test to be considered valid, a signed statement must be obtained from the STT or BAT in accordance with ยง 40.271(b) .
