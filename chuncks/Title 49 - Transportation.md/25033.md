####### Flexion.

(1)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure N2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 74 degrees and 92 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyles shall be not less than 27 N-m (19.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 33 N-m (24.3 ft-lbf).

(ii) The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 5 N-m (3.7 ft-lbf) between 103 ms and 123 ms.

(iii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = M-(0.01778m) x (F).

(iv) Mis the moment about the y-axis and Fis the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) and 0.01778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
