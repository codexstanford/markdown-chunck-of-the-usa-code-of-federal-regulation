####### Determination of test load.

(h)(1) To determine test loads for purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) and (f)(2)(viii), follow the procedure set forth in paragraphs (h) (2) through (5) of this section.

(2) Determine the tire's maximum inflation pressure and maximum load rating both as specified on the tire's sidewall.

(3) Determine the appropriate multiplier corresponding to the tire's maximum inflation pressure, as set forth in Table 2.

(4) Multiply the tire's maximum load rating by the multiplier determined in paragraph (h)(3). This is the tire's calculated load.

(5) Round the product determined in paragraph (h)(4) (the calculated load) to the nearest multiple of ten pounds or, if metric units are used, 5 kilograms. For example, 903 pounds would be rounded to 900 and 533 kilograms would be rounded to 535. This figure is the test load.
