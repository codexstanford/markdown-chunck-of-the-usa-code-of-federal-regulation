######## Sole source aquifer (SSA)

means an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Sole Source Aquifer program as the "sole or principal" source of drinking water for an area. Such designations are made if the aquifer's ground water supplies 50% or more of the drinking water for an area, and if that aquifer were to become contaminated, it would pose a public health hazard. A sole source aquifer that is karst in nature is one composed of limestone where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. They are often cavernous, with high rates of flow.
