####### Reported problems.

(5)Following any report of a taste problem with the water from a system or a health problem resulting from the water in a system, samples of water from each tap or dispensing location on the system shall be collected and sent to a laboratory approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for testing for heterotrophic plate counts, total coliform, and fecal coliform. If a single sample fails any of these tests, the system must be treated as follows:

(i) Heterotrophic plate count. Drain and flush the system within two days, and then return it to service.

(ii) Total coliform. Remove the system from service, drain and flush system, resample the system, and then return the system to service.

(iii) Fecal coliform. Remove the system from service, drain and flush the system, resample the system, and do not return the system to service until a satisfactory result on the test of the samples is obtained from the laboratory.
