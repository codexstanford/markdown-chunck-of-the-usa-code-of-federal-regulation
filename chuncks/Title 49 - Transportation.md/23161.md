####### Right seat belt mounting structure horizontal approach angles.

(h)

(1) Locate a line formed by the shortest horizontal distance between CG-F2 for the right seat and the right seat belt mounting structure. If the seat belt mounting structure is below a horizontal plane passing through CG-F2 for the right seat, locate the point 200 mm directly below that CG-F2 and locate a line formed by the shortest horizontal distance between that point and the right seat belt mounting structure. The minimum horizontal approach angle for the right seat belt mounting structure equals the angle formed by that line and the X-axis of the vehicle measured counterclockwise, or 90 degrees, whichever is less.

(2) Locate a line formed by the shortest horizontal distance between CG-R for the right seat and the right seat belt mounting structure. If the seat belt mounting structure is below a horizontal plane passing through CG-R, locate the point 200 mm directly below CG-R and locate a line formed by the shortest horizontal distance between that point and the right seat belt mounting structure. The maximum horizontal approach angle for the right seat belt mounting structure equals the angle formed by that line and the X-axis of the vehicle measured counterclockwise. If the CG-R does not exist, or is forward of the seat belt mounting structure, the maximum horizontal approach angle is 90 degrees.
