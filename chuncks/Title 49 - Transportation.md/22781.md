####### Brake temperature measurement.

S6.4.1.The brake temperature is measured by plug-type thermocouples installed in the approximate center of the facing length and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc pad, one per brake, as shown in Figure 1. A second thermocouple may be installed at the beginning of the test sequence if the lining wear is expected to reach a point causing the first thermocouple to contact the metal rubbing surface of a drum or rotor. For center-grooved shoes or pads, thermocouples are installed within 3 mm (.12 in) to 6 mm (.24 in) of the groove and as close to the center as possible.
