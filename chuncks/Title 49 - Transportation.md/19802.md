If the agencies approve an off-cycle technology under ยง 535.7(f) and 40 CFR 1037.610 in the form of an improvement factor, enter the improvement factor expressed as a percentage reduction in COemissions. (Note: In the case of approved off-cycle technologies whose benefit is quantified as a g/ton-mile credit, apply the credit to the GEM result, not as a GEM input value.)
