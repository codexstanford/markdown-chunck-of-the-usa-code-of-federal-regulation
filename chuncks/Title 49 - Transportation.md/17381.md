The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) comprise parts 350 through 399 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). These regulations set minimum safety standards for motor carriers, vehicles, and drivers operating in interstate commerce. The areas covered include motor carrier registration, financial responsibility requirements, driver qualifications, licensing, hours of driving and on duty time, vehicle safety equipment, operating condition, inspection, and maintenance. In some areas, Congress has enacted exemptions for certain categories of vehicles or operations. Accordingly, the Agency does not exercise regulatory authority over some operators who meet the definition of aoroperating in interstate commerce.
