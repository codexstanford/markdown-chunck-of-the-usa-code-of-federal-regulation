###### ยง 520.21 Preparation of environmental reviews, negative declarations, and notices of intent.
####### Applicants.

(c)(1) Each applicant for a grant, loan, or other financial assistance for use in State and community projects may be requested to submit, with the original application, an environmental assessment of the proposed project.

(2) Under OMB Revised Circular A-95, "Evaluation, Review, and Coordination of Federal Assistance Programs and Projects," and DOT 4600.4B, "Evaluation, Review and Coordination of DOT Assistance Programs and Projects," dated February 27, 1974, a grant applicant must notify the clearinghouse of its intention to apply for Federal program assistance. The notification must solicit comments on the project and its impacts from appropriate State and local agencies. Since it is the NHTSA's policy to assure that (i) interested parties and Federal, State, and local agencies receive early notification of the decision to prepare an environmental impact statement, and (ii) their comments on the environmental effects of the proposed Federal action are solicited at an early stage in the preparation of the draft impact statement, this early notification requirement may be met by a grant applicant by sending the notification to interested parties and agencies at the same time it is sent to the clearinghouse.
