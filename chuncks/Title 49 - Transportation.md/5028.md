######## Oxidizing gases by aircraft.

(f)A cylinder containing carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture, compressed; liquefied gas, oxidizing, n.o.s.; or nitrous oxide is authorized for transportation by aircraft only when it meets the following requirements:

(1) Only DOT specification 3A, 3AA, 3AL, 3E, 3HT, and 39 cylinders, and UN pressure receptacles ISO 9809-1, ISO 9809-2, ISO 9809-3 and ISO 7866 cylinders are authorized.

(2) Cylinders must be equipped with a pressure relief device in accordance with ยง 173.301(f) and, for DOT 39 cylinders offered for transportation after October 1, 2008, for the other DOT specification cylinders with the first requalification due after October 1, 2008, or for the UN pressure receptacles prior to initial use:

(i) The rated burst pressure of a rupture disc for DOT 3A, 3AA, 3AL, and 3E cylinders, and UN pressure receptacles ISO 9809-1, ISO 9809-2, ISO 9809-3, and ISO 7866 cylinders must be 100% of the cylinder minimum test pressure with a tolerance of plus zero to minus 10%;

(ii) The rated burst pressure of a rupture disc for a DOT 3HT cylinder must be 90% of the cylinder minimum test pressure with a tolerance of plus zero to minus 10%; and

(iii) The rated burst pressure of a rupture disc for a DOT 39 cylinder must be not more than 80 percent of cylinder burst pressure but not less than 105 percent of cylinder test pressure. Cylinders filled and offered for transportation in accordance with the requirements of the section before January 27, 2021 may continue to be used for the life of the packaging.

(3) The cylinder must be placed in a rigid outer packaging that-

(i) Conforms to the requirements of either part 178, subparts L and M, of this subchapter at the Packing Group I or II performance level, or the performance criteria in Air Transport Association (ATA) Specification No. 300 for a Category I Shipping Container;

(ii) Is capable of passing, as demonstrated by design testing, the Flame Penetration Resistance Test in appendix E to part 178 of this subchapter; and

(iii) Prior to each shipment, passes a visual inspection that verifies that all features of the packaging are in good condition, including all latches, hinges, seams, and other features, and the packaging is free from perforations, cracks, dents, or other abrasions that may negatively affect the flame penetration resistance and thermal resistance characteristics of the container.

(4) The cylinder and the outer packaging must be capable of passing, as demonstrated by design testing, the Thermal Resistance Test specified in appendix D to part 178 of this subchapter.

(5) The cylinder and the outer packaging must both be marked and labeled in accordance with part 172, subparts D and E of this subchapter. The additional marking "DOT31FP," is allowed to indicate that the cylinder and the outer packaging are capable of passing, as demonstrated by design testing, the Thermal Resistance Test specified in appendix D to part 178 of this subchapter.

(6) A cylinder of compressed oxygen that has been furnished by an aircraft operator to a passenger in accordance with 14 CFR 121.574, 125.219, or 135.91 is excepted from the outer packaging requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
