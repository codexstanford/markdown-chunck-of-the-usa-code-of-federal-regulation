This policy was repeated in slightly different form in regulatory guidance published on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60734, 60745) and April 4, 1997 (62 FR 16370, 16407). (More information about this matter can be found in Question 10 under regulatory guidance for ยง 390.5 on the FMCSA website,.) This position was also reiterated in a final rule on private motor carriers of passengers (59 FR 8748, Feb. 23, 1994), which adopted certain exceptions for "private motor carriers of passengers (business)" (now codified at 49 CFR 391.69) and "private motor carriers of passengers (nonbusiness)" (49 CFR 391.68).
