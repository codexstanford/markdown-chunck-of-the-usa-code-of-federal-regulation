####### Luminance Test.

S6.3Test the orange fluorescent material as follows:

(a) Unless dual purpose material is used, prevent the red reflex reflective material from affecting the photometric measurement of the luminance of the orange fluorescent material.

(b) Using a 150-watt high pressure xenon compact arc lamp as the light source, illuminate the test sample at an angle of incidence of 45&#xB0; and an angle of observation of 90&#xB0;. If dual purpose material is being tested, illuminate the sample diffusely through an integrating sphere.

(c) Measure the luminance of the material at a perpendicular viewing angle, with no ray of the viewing beam more than 5&#xB0; from the perpendicular to the specimen.

(d) Repeat the procedure for a flat magnesium oxide surface, and compute the quotient (percentage) of the luminance of the material relative to that of the magnesium oxide surface.
