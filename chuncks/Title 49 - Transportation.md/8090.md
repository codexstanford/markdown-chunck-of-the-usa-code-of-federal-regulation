######## Method 6: Alternative Technology.

(6)Operators may use an alternative technical evaluation process that provides a documented engineering analysis for establishing MAOP. If an operator elects to use alternative technology, the operator must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with ยง 192.18. The notification must include descriptions of the following details:

(i) The technology or technologies to be used for tests, examinations, and assessments; the method for establishing material properties; and analytical techniques with similar analysis from prior tool runs done to ensure the results are consistent with the required corresponding hydrostatic test pressure for the pipeline segment being evaluated;

(ii) Procedures and processes to conduct tests, examinations, assessments and evaluations, analyze defects and flaws, and remediate defects discovered;

(iii) Pipeline segment data, including original design, maintenance and operating history, anomaly or flaw characterization;

(iv) Assessment techniques and acceptance criteria, including anomaly detection confidence level, probability of detection, and uncertainty of the predicted failure pressure quantified as a fraction of specified minimum yield strength;

(v) If any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining life of the pipeline in accordance with paragraph ยง 192.712;

(vi) Operational monitoring procedures;

(vii) Methodology and criteria used to justify and establish the MAOP; and

(vii) Documentation of the operator's process and procedures used to implement the use of the alternative technology, including any records generated through its use.
