######## Heat treatment.

(g)The completed containers must be uniformly and properly heat-treated prior to tests. Heat-treatment of containers of the authorized analysis must be as follows:

(1) All containers must be quenched by oil, or other suitable medium except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.

(2) The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but may not exceed 1,750 &#xB0;F.

(3) The steel must be tempered at the temperature most suitable for the analysis except that in no case shall the tempering temperature be less than 1,000 &#xB0;F.

(4) The steel may be normalized at a temperature of 1,650 &#xB0;F instead of being quenched, and containers so normalized need not be tempered.

(5) All cylinders, if water quenched or quenched with a liquid producing a cooling rate in excess of 80 percent of the cooling rate of water, must be inspected by the magnetic particle or dye penetrant method to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Any cylinder found to have a quench crack must be rejected and may not be requalified.
