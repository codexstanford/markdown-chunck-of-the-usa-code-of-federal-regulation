###### ยง 587.15 Verification of aluminum honeycomb crush strength.
####### Testing hardware.

(g)(1) The hardware used to verify crush strength is capable of applying a load of 13.3 kN (3,000 lb), over at least a 16.5 mm (0.65 in) stroke. The crush rate is constant and known. To ensure that the load is applied to the entire sample, the top and bottom crush plates are no smaller than 165 mm by 165 mm (6.5 in x 6.5 in). The engaging surfaces of the crush plates have a roughness approximately equivalent to 60 grit sandpaper. The bottom crush plate is marked to ensure that the applied load is centered on the sample.

(2) The crush plate assemblies have an average angular rigidity (about axes normal to the direction of crush) of at least 1017 Nm/deg (750 ft-lb/deg), over the range of 0 to 203 Nm (0 to 150 ft-lb) applied torque.
