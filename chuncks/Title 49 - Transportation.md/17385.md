In 1963, the Third Circuit held that intrastate transportation of passengers in the Virgin Islands pursuant to prearranged packages covering both lodging and travel was interstate commerce (v.315 F.2d 364 (3rd Cir. 1963)). Federal court decisions have increasingly expanded this line of analysis and found ground transportation to be in the stream of interstate commerce where, even in the absence of packaged travel arrangements, the traveler separately booked the air and ground portions of a trip. Seev.631 F.3d 1210 (11th Cir. 2011);v.789 F.2d 1523 (11th Cir. 1986);v.678 F.2d 586 (5th Cir. 1982);v.494 F.Supp.2d 1197 (D. Col. 2007).
