######## Termination of a design type approval certificate.

(j)(1) The Associate Administrator may terminate an approval certificate issue under this section if it is determined that, because of a change in circumstances, the approval no longer is needed or no longer would be granted if applied for; information upon which the approval was based is fraudulent or substantially erroneous; or termination of the approval is necessary to adequately protect against risks to life and property.

(2) Before an approval is terminated, the Associate Administrator will provide the manufacturer and the approval agency-

(i) Written notice of the facts or conduct believed to warrant the withdrawal;

(ii) Opportunity to submit oral and written evidence, and

(iii) Opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the application requirement.

(3) If the Associate Administrator determines that a certificate of approval must be withdrawn to preclude a significant and imminent adverse affect on public safety, the procedures in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section need not be provided prior to withdrawal of the approval, but shall be provided as soon as practicable thereafter.
