####### Test procedure.

S7.2.2.2Before the test, prepare the surface of the test rubber by lightly abrading with waterproof silicon carbide paper, grade P120, weight D (120 wet and dry). Then wipe the surface clean with a dry cloth or brush. No solvents or other cleaning materials are used. To determine the coefficient of friction for the wet platform section pull the test block, with the test rubber attached, by machine at a rate of 20 +/-2mm/s. The machine and test block are rigidly linked by a device that exhibits a stiffness greater than or equal to 1 x 10N/m. Pull the test block for a minimum of 13 seconds. Record the pulling force over the final 10 seconds of the test at a minimum frequency of 10 Hz. Repeat the test at least 5 times on any one area of the platform surface, in a single direction. Calculate the average pulling force for each trial, Fthrough F, where n is the number of trials. Measure the weight of the test block with the force gauge and call it F. Calculate the coefficient of friction, &#x3BC;, from the following equation:
