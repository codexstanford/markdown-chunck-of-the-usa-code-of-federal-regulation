######## see

(2) No pressure receptacle due for requalification may be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce unless that pressure receptacle has been successfully requalified and marked in accordance with this subpart or requalified and marked by a facility registered by Transport Canada in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR,§ 171.7 of this subchapter). A pressure receptacle may be requalified at any time during or before the month and year that the requalification is due. However, a pressure receptacle filled before the requalification becomes due may remain in service until it is emptied. In accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations a CAN marked UN cylinder may be requalified in the United States by a domestic requalifier, provided the requirements in §§ 178.69, 178.70, and 178.71, as applicable, are met.

(3) A pressure receptacle with a specified service life may not be requalified after its authorized service life has expired. A pressure receptacle with a specified service life may not be refilled and offered for transportation after its authorized service life has expired unless approval has been obtained in writing from the Associate Administrator.
