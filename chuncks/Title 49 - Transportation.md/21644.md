####### Durability tests.

S14.9.3.2.2The power supply used in the standard test circuit for conducting durability tests must comply with the following specifications:

(a) Must not generate any adverse transients not present in motor vehicles;

(b) Be capable of supplying 13 vdc and 14 vdc for 12 volt flashers and 6.5 vdc and 7 vdc for 6 volt flashers to the input terminals of the standard test circuit;

(c) Be capable of supplying a continuous output current of the design load for one flasher times the number of flashers and inrush currents as required by the design bulb load complement;

(d) Be capable of supplying an output voltage that does not deviate more than 2% with changes in the static load from 0 to maximum (not including inrush current) and means must be provided to compensate for static input line voltage variations;

(e) Be capable of supplying an output voltage that does not deviate more than 1.0 vdc from 0 to maximum load (including inrush current) and must recover 63% of its maximum excursion within 5 µsec; and

(f) Have a ripple voltage of 300 mv, peak to peak.
