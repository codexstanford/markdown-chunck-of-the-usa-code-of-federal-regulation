####### Lateral lumbar flexion qualification test.

(2)(i) Plane D, referenced in figure W10, shall rotate in the direction of pre-impact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 46.1 degrees and 58.2 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within these angles, the peak moment measured by the neck/lumbar transducer (drawing SA572-S8) shall have a value between 79.4 N-m and 98.1 N-m.

(ii) The decaying headform rotation vs. time curve shall cross the zero angle with respect to its initial position at time of impact relative to the pendulum centerline between 48 to 59 ms after the time the peak rotation value is reached.

(iii) All instrumentation data channels are defined to be zero when the longitudinal centerline of the lumbar spine and pendulum are parallel.

(iv) The headform rotation shall be calculated by the following formula with the integration beginning at time zero:
