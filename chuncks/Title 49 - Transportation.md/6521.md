######## Same design.

(2)The term "same design" as used in this section means cargo tanks made to the same design type. See ยง 178.320(a) for definition of "design type".

(3) For a cargo tank used in nonflammable cryogenic liquid service, in place of the holding time tests prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the marked rated holding time (MRHT) may be determined as follows:

(i) While the cargo tank is stationary, the heat transfer rate must be determined by measuring the normal evaporation rate (NER) of the test cryogenic liquid (preferably the lading, where feasible) maintained at approximately one atmosphere. The calculated heat transfer rate must be determined from:

(ii) The rated holding time (RHT) must be calculated as follows:

(iii) The MRHT (see ยง 178.338-18(b)(9) of this subchapter) may not exceed the RHT.
