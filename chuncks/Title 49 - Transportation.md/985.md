#### Appendix A to Part 24 - Additional Information
##### Section 24.3 No Duplication of Payments.

This section prohibits an Agency from making a payment to a person under these regulations that would duplicate another payment the person receives under Federal, State, or local law. The Agency is not required to conduct an exhaustive search for such other payments; it is only required to avoid creating a duplication based on the Agency's knowledge at the time a payment is computed.

Federal Agencies may find that, for Federal eminent domain purposes, the terms "fair market value" (as used throughout this subpart) and "market value," which may be the more typical term in private transactions, may be synonymous.
