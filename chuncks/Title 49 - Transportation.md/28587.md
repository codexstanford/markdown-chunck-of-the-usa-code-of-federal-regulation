### Chapter X - Surface Transportation Board
#### Subchapter B - Rules of Practice
##### PART 1115 - APPELLATE PROCEDURES
###### ยง 1115.6 Exhaustion of remedies and judicial review.

These rules do not relieve the requirement that a party exhaust its administrative remedies before going to court. Any action appealable as of right must be timely appealed. If an appeal, discretionary appeal, or petition seeking reopening is filed under ยง 1115.2 or ยง 1115.3 of this part, before or after a petition seeking judicial review is filed with the courts, the Board will act upon the appeal or petition after advising the court of its pendency unless action might interfere with the court's jurisdiction.
