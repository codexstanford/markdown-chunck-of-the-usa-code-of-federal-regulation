####### if there are factual or procedural disputes,

Under §§ 385.15 and 385.17, motor carriers have the right to petition for a review of their ratingsand to request another review after corrective actions have been taken. They are the procedural avenues a motor carrier which believes its safety rating to be in error may exercise, and the means to request another review after corrective action has been taken.

(a) The FMCSA believes this "safety fitness rating methodology" is a reasonable approach for assigning a safety rating which best describes the current safety fitness posture of a motor carrier as required by the safety fitness regulations (§ 385.9). This methodology has the capability to incorporate regulatory changes as they occur.

(b) Improved compliance with the regulations leads to an improved rating, which in turn increases safety. This increased safety is our regulatory goal.
