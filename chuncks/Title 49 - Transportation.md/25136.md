####### Test procedure.

(b)(1) Soak the lumbar spine-headform assembly in a test environment as specified in ยง 572.189(n);

(2) Attach the lumbar spine-headform assembly to the Part 572 pendulum test fixture per procedure in ยง 572.183(b)(2) and as shown in Figure U2-A in appendix A to this subpart. Torque the lumbar hex nut (p/n 9000057) on to the lumbar cable assembly (175-5506) to 50 +/-5 in-lb;

(3) Release the pendulum from a height sufficient to allow it to fall freely to achieve an impact velocity of 6.05 +/-0.1 m/s measured at the center of the pendulum accelerometer (Figure 22) at the time the pendulum makes contact with its decelerating mechanism. The velocity-time history of the pendulum falls inside the corridor determined by the upper and lower boundaries specified in Table 1 to paragraph (b) of this section;

(4) Allow the lumbar spine to flex without the lumbar spine or the headform making contact with any object;

(5) Time zero is defined in ยง 572.189(j).
