####### ยง 180.209 Requirements for requalification of specification cylinders.
######## Cylinders in non-corrosive gas service.

(e)A cylinder made in conformance with DOT Specifications 4B, 4BA, 4BW, or 4E protected externally by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating and used exclusively for non-corrosive gas that is commercially free from corroding components may be requalified by volumetric expansion testing every 12 years instead of every 5 years. As an alternative, the cylinder may be subjected to a proof pressure test at least two times the marked service pressure, but this latter type of test must be repeated every 10 years after expiration of the initial 12-year period. When subjected to a proof pressure test, as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter), the cylinder must be carefully examined under test pressure and removed from service if a leak or defect is found.
