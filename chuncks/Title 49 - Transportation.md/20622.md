###### ยง 571.103 Standard No. 103; Windshield defrosting and defogging systems.
####### Demonstration procedure.

S4.3The passenger car windshield defrosting and defogging system shall be tested in accordance with the portions of paragraphs 4.1 through 4.4.7 of SAE Recommended Practice J902 (1964) or SAE Recommended Practice J902a (1967) (both incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5) applicable to that system, except that-

(a) During the first 5 minutes of the test:

(1) For a passenger car equipped with a heating system other than a heat exchanger type that uses the engine's coolant as a means to supply the heat to the heat exchanger, the warm-up procedure is that specified by the vehicle's manufacturer for cold weather starting, except that connection to a power or heat source external to the vehicle is not permitted.

(2) For all other passenger cars, the warm-up procedure may be that recommended by the vehicle's manufacturer for cold weather starting.

(b) During the last 35 minutes of the test period (or the entire test period if the 5-minute warm-up procedure specified in paragraph (a) of this section is not used),

(1) For a passenger car equipped with a heating system other than a heat exchanger type that uses the engine's coolant as a means to supply the heat to the heat exchanger, the procedure shall be that specified by the vehicle's manufacturer for cold weather starting, except that connection to a power or heat source external to the vehicle is not permitted.

(2) For all other passenger cars, either-

(i) The engine speed shall not exceed 1,500 r.p.m. in neutral gear; or

(ii) The engine speed and load shall not exceed the speed and load at 40 kilometers per hour in the manufacturer's recommended gear with road load;

(c) A room air change of 90 times per hour is not required;

(d) The windshield wipers may be used during the test if they are operated without manual assist;

(e) One or two windows may be open a total of 25 millimeters;

(f) The defroster blower may be turned on at any time; and

(g) The wind velocity is at any level from 0 to 3 kilometers per hour.

(h) The test chamber temperature and the wind velocity shall be measured, after the engine has been started, at the forwardmost point of the vehicle or a point 914 millimeters from the base of the windshield, whichever is farther forward, at a level halfway between the top and bottom of the windshield on the vehicle centerline.
