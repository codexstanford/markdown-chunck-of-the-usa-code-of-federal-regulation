S5.6.3Each parking brake system shall meet the requirements of S5.6.3.1 through S5.6.3.4.

S5.6.3.1 The parking brake system shall be capable of achieving the minimum performance specified either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2 with any single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (excluding failure of a component of a brake chamber housing but including failure of any brake chamber diaphragm that is part of any other brake system including a diaphragm which is common to the parking brake system and any other brake system), when the pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers are at the levels determined in S5.6.3.4.

S5.6.3.2 A mechanical means shall be provided that, after a parking brake application is made with the pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers at the levels determined in S5.6.3.4, and all air and fluid pressures in the vehicle's braking systems are then bled down to zero, and without using electrical power, holds the parking brake application with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the minimum performance specified in S5.6.3.1 and in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.

S5.6.3.3 For trucks and buses, with an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, no later than three seconds from the time of actuation of the parking brake control, the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 shall be actuated. For trailers, with the supply line initially pressurized to 100 psi using the supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, no later than three seconds from the time venting to the atmosphere of the front supply line coupling is initiated, the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 shall be actuated. This requirement shall be met for trucks, buses and trailers both with and without any single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1).

S5.6.3.4 The parking brake chamber pressures for S5.6.3.1 and S5.6.3.2 are determined as follows. For trucks and buses, with an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, any single leakage type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), is introduced in the brake system. The parking brake control is actuated and the pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers are measured three seconds after that actuation is initiated. For trailers, with the supply line initially pressurized to 100 psi using the supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, any single leakage type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), is introduced in the brake system. The front supply line coupling is vented to the atmosphere and the pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers are measured three seconds after that venting is initiated.
