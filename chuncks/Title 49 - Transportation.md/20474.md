####### Inspection procedure.

(1)Insert a low range (0 to 25 amperes for most 2- and 4-brake systems and 0 to 40 amperes for a 6-brake system) d.c. ammeter into the brake circuit between the controller and the brakes. With the controller in the "off" position, the ammeter should read zero. Gradually apply the controller to the "full on" position for a brief period (not to exceed 1 minute) and observe the maximum ammeter reading. Gradually return the controller to "full off" and observe return to zero amperes. Divide the maximum ammeter reading by the number of brakes and determine the brake amperage value.
