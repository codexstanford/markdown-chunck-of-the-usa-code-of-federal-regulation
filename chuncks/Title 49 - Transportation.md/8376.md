####### Basic test.

I.The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more than-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during testing are not considered. A welder who successfully passes a butt-weld qualification test under this section shall be qualified to weld on all pipe diameters less than or equal to 12 inches.
