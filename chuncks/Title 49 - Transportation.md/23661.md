S16.3.4

S16.3.4.1 If the head restraint has an automatic adjustment, leave it where the system positions the restraint after the dummy is placed in the seat.

S16.3.4.2 Adjust each head restraint to its lowest position.

S16.3.4.3 Measure the vertical distance from the top most point of the head restraint to the bottom most point. Locate a horizontal plane through the midpoint of this distance. Adjust each head restraint vertically so that this horizontal plane is aligned with the center of gravity (CG) of the dummy head.

S16.3.4.3 If the above position is not attainable, move the vertical center of the head restraint to the closest detent below the center of the head CG.

S16.3.4.4 If the head restraint has a fore and aft adjustment, place the restraint in the forwardmost position or until contact with the head is made, whichever occurs first.
