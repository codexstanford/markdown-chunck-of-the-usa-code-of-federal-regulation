##### § 24.305 Fixed payment for moving expenses - nonresidential moves.
###### Business.

(a)A displaced business may be eligible to choose a fixed payment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses, and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by §§ 24.301, 24.303 and 24.304. Such fixed payment, except for payment to a nonprofit organization, shall equal the average annual net earnings of the business, as computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. The displaced business is eligible for the payment if the Agency determines that:

(1) The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move and, the business vacates or relocates from its displacement site;

(2) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is assumed to meet this test unless the Agency determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage;

(3) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Agency, and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities.

(4) The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others;

(5) The business is not operated at the displacement site solely for the purpose of renting the site to others; and

(6) The business contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement. (See § 24.2(a)(7).)
