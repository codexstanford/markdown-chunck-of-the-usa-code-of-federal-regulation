S14.9.3.11.9.1

S14.9.3.11.9.1.1 The sensitivity of the sample device is adjusted so that it complies with the sensitivity test and the mechanical aim of the photounit determined.

S14.9.3.11.9.1.2 The sample device must be mounted in proper vehicle position and subjected to vibration of 5g constant acceleration forhour in each of three directions: vertical; horizontal and parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis; and horizontal and normal to the vehicle longitudinal axis.

S14.9.3.11.9.1.3 The vibration frequency must be varied from 30 to 200 and back to 30 cycles per second over a period of approximately 1 minute.

S14.9.3.11.9.1.4 The device must be operating during the test.

S14.9.3.11.9.1.5 At the conclusion of the test the H-V "dim" sensitivity of the sample device and the mechanical aim of the photounit must be measured.
