######## Separated by a complete compartment or hold from

(iv) "": Either a vertical or horizontal separation. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, then only a longitudinal separation (i.e., by an intervening complete compartment or hold) is acceptable. For "on deck" stowage, this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 12 m (39 feet) horizontally. The same distance must be applied if one package is stowed "on deck", and the other one in an upper compartment.
