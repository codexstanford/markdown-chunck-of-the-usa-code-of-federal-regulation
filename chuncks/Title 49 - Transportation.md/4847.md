######## Lithium batteries.,e.g.,

(d)Except as provided in § 172.102, special provision A101, of this subchapter, vehicles, engines, and machinery powered by lithium metal batteries, that are transported with these batteries installed, are forbidden aboard passenger-carrying aircraft. Lithium batteries contained in vehicles, engines, or mechanical equipment must be securely fastened in the battery holder of the vehicle, engine, or mechanical equipment, and be protected in such a manner as to prevent damage and short circuits (by using non-conductive caps that cover the terminals entirely). Except for vehicles, engines, or machinery transported by highway, rail, or vessel with prototype or low production lithium batteries securely installed, each lithium battery must be of a type that has successfully passed each test in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), as specified in § 173.185, unless approved by the Associate Administrator. Where a vehicle could possibly be handled in other than an upright position, the vehicle must be secured in a strong, rigid outer packaging. The vehicle must be secured by means capable of restraining the vehicle in the outer packaging to prevent any shifting during transport which would change the orientation or cause the vehicle to be damaged. Where the lithium battery is removed from the vehicle and is packed separate from the vehicle in the same outer packaging, the package must be consigned as "UN 3481, Lithium ion batteries packed with equipment" or "UN 3091, Lithium metal batteries packed with equipment" and prepared in accordance with the requirements specified in § 173.185.
