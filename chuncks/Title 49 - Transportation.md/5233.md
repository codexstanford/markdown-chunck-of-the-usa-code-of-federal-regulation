######## Surface Contaminated Object (SCO)

means a solid object which is not itself radioactive but which has radioactive material distributed on its surface. SCO exists in two phases:

(1) SCO-I: A solid object on which:

(i) The non-fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 4 Bq/cm(10microcurie/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 0.4 Bq/cm(10microcurie/cm) for all other alpha emitters;

(ii) The fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 4 x 10Bq/cm(1.0 microcurie/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 4 x 10Bq/cm(0.1 microcurie/cm) for all other alpha emitters; and

(iii) The non-fixed contamination plus the fixed contamination on the inaccessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 4 x 10Bq/cm(1 microcurie/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 4 x 10Bq/cm(0.1 microcurie/cm) for all other alpha emitters.

(2) SCO-II: A solid object on which the limits for SCO-I are exceeded and on which:

(i) The non-fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 400 Bq/cm(10microcurie/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 40 Bq/cm(10microcurie/cm) for all other alpha emitters;

(ii) The fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 8 x 10Bq/cm(20 microcurie/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 8 x 10Bq/cm(2 microcuries/cm) for all other alpha emitters; and

(iii) The non-fixed contamination plus the fixed contamination on the inaccessible surface averaged over 300 cm(or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm) does not exceed 8 x 10Bq/cm(20 microcuries/cm) for beta and gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 8 x 10Bq/cm(2 microcuries/cm) for all other alpha emitters.
