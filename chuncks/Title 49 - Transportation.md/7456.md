####### ยง 180.509 Requirements for inspection and test of specification tank cars.
######## Thickness tests.,i.e.

(f)(1) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car facility measures the thickness of the tank car shell, heads, sumps, protective housing (, domes), and nozzles on each tank car by using a device capable of accurately measuring the thickness to within +/-0.05 mm (+/-0.002 inch).

(2) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car has a thickness test measurement:

(i) At the time of an internal coating or lining application or replacement, or

(ii) At least once every ten (10) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining, or

(iii) At least once every five (5) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining when:

(A) The tank is used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the tank (see Appendix D of this part) or service equipment as defined ยง 180.503, and

(B) The remaining shell and head thickness is tested and determined to be at or below line C in Figure A of this paragraph.

(3) For a localized repair of an internal coating or lining where a material corrosive to the tank or service equipment as defined ยง 180.503 has contacted the tank, a qualified individual must verify the coating or lining's conformance with paragraph (g) of this section by measuring the shell or head in the area of the repair. The thickness test applies only to the non-lined or coated repaired area, and is not a qualification event. Modification of the tank stencil is not required.

(4) Operation of a tank car below the condemning limit for general corrosion or the condemning limit for localized corrosion (as shown in Figure A of this section) is prohibited.
