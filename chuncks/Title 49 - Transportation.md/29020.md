######## significant

(b) Atransaction is a transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads that is of regional or national transportation significance as that phrase is used in 49 U.S.C. 11325(a)(2) and (c). A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads is not significant if a determination can be made either:

(1) That the transaction clearly will not have any anticompetitive effects, or

(2) That any anticompetitive effects of the transaction will clearly be outweighed by the transaction's anticipated contribution to the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.

A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads is significant if neither such determination can clearly be made.
