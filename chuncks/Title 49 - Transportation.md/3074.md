I. (a) Pursuant to the authority of section 208(b) of title 18, United States Code, the following are exempted from the prohibitions of section 208(a) of title 18, United States Code, because they are too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's services in any matter in which he may act in his governmental capacity.

(1) Any holding in a widely held mutual fund, or regulated investment company, which does not specialize in an industry in which the possibility of conflict arise.

(2) Continued participation in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health, or accident insurance plan or other employee welfare or benefit plan that is maintained by a business or nonprofit organization by which the employee was formerly employed, to the extent that the employee's rights in the plans are vested and require no additional services by him or further payments to the plans by the organization with respect to the services of the employee. In addition, to the extent that the welfare or benefit plan is a profit sharing or stock bonus plan, this exemption does not apply and the procedures prescribed in ยง 99.735-15c (c) through (e) will apply to the interest of that employee in the plan.

(3) Participation in an air carrier frequent flyers or substantially similar program that is available to the general public on the same terms and conditions and involves no direct financial interest in the carrier, such as stockholdings or similar types of investment interests.
