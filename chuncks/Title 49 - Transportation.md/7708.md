###### § 191.23 Reporting safety-related conditions.
####### See

(10) For transmission pipelines only, each exceedance of the maximum allowable operating pressure that exceeds the margin (build-up) allowed for operation of pressure-limiting or control devices as specified in the applicable requirements of §§ 192.201, 192.620(e), and 192.739. The reporting requirement of this paragraph (a)(10) is not applicable to gathering lines, distribution lines, LNG facilities, or underground natural gas storage facilities (paragraph (a)(6) of this section).

(11) Any malfunction or operating error that causes the pressure of a UNGSF using a salt cavern for natural gas storage to fall below its minimum allowable operating pressure, as defined by the facility's State or Federal operating permit or certificate, whichever pressure is higher.

(b) A report is not required for any safety-related condition that-

(1) Exists on a master meter system, a reporting-regulated gathering pipeline, a Type C gas gathering pipeline with an outside diameter of 12.75 inches or less, a Type C gas gathering pipeline covered by the exception in § 192.9(f)(1) of this subchapter and therefore not required to comply with § 192.9(e)(2)(ii), or a customer-owned service line;

(2) Is an incident or results in an incident before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report;

(3) Exists on a pipeline (other than an UNGSF or an LNG facility) that is more than 220 yards (200 meters) from any building intended for human occupancy or outdoor place of assembly, except that reports are required for conditions within the right-of-way of an active railroad, paved road, street, or highway; or

(4) Is corrected by repair or replacement in accordance with applicable safety standards before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report. Notwithstanding this exception, a report must be filed for:

(i) Conditions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, unless the condition is localized corrosion pitting on an effectively coated and cathodically protected pipeline; and

(ii) Any condition under paragraph (a)(10) of this section.

(5) Exists on an UNGSF, where a well or wellhead is isolated, allowing the reservoir or cavern and all other components of the facility to continue to operate normally and without pressure restriction.
