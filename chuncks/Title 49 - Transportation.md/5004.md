####### ยง 173.302a Additional requirements for shipment of nonliquefied (permanent) compressed gases in specification cylinders.
######## Special filling limits for DOT 3A, 3AX, 3AA, 3AAX, and 3T cylinders.

(b)A DOT 3A, 3AX, 3AA, 3AAX, and 3T cylinder may be filled with a compressed gas, other than a liquefied, dissolved, Division 2.1, or Division 2.3 gas, to a pressure 10 percent in excess of its marked service pressure, provided:

(1) The cylinder is equipped with a frangible disc pressure relief device (without fusible metal backing) having a bursting pressure not exceeding the minimum prescribed test pressure.

(2) The cylinder's elastic expansion was determined at the time of the last test or retest by the water jacket method.

(3) Either the average wall stress or the maximum wall stress does not exceed the wall stress limitation shown in the following table:

(i)(A) The average wall stress must be computed from the elastic expansion data using the following formula:

(B) The formula in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section is derived from the formula in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and the following:

(ii) The maximum wall stress must be computed from the formula:

(iii) Compliance with average wall stress limitation may be determined by computing the elastic expansion rejection limit in accordance with CGA C-5, by reference to data tabulated in CGA C-5, or by the manufacturer's marked elastic expansion rejection limit (REE) on the cylinder.

(4) An external and internal visual examination made at the time of test or retest shows the cylinder to be free from excessive corrosion, pitting, or dangerous defects.

(5) A plus sign (+) is added following the test date marking on the cylinder to indicate compliance with paragraphs (b) (2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section.
