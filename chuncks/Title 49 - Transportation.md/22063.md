###### ยง 571.116 Standard No. 116; Motor vehicle brake fluids.
####### At low temperature.

(a)Humidify 100 +/-1 ml. of DOT 5 SBBF brake fluid in accordance with S6.2 eliminating determination of the ERBP. When testing brake fluids except DOT 5 SBBF, mix 3.5 +/-0.1 ml. of distilled water with 100 +/-1 ml. of the brake fluid; pour into a centrifuge tube. Stopper the tube with a clean cork and place in the cold chamber maintained at minus 40 +/-2 &#xB0;C. (minus 40 +/-3.6 &#xB0;F.). After 120 hours +/-2 hours remove the tube, quickly wipe with clean lint-free cloth saturated with ethanol or acetone and examine the fluid for evidence of sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification. Invert the tube and determine the number of seconds required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid. (The air bubble is considered to have reached the top of the fluid when the top of the bubble reaches the 2 ml. graduation of the centrifuge tube.) If the wet fluid has become cloudy, warm to 23 +/-5 &#xB0;C. (73.4 +/-9 &#xB0;F.) and note appearance and fluidity.
