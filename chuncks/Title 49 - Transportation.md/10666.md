(b)A railroad is not to report the following injuries to or illnesses of a railroad employee as Worker on Duty-Employee (Class A), if any of the conditions in this paragraph (b) are met. (These exceptions apply only to Worker on Duty-Employee (Class A) and do not affect a railroad's obligation to report these injuries and illnesses as other types of persons (Employee Not On Duty (Class B); Passenger on Trains (Class C); Nontrespassers-On Railroad Property (Class D); Trespassers (Class E)), or a railroad's obligation to maintain a "Railroad Employee Injury/Illness Record" (Form FRA F 6180.98 or alternative railroad-designed form)).

(1) The injury or illness occurred in or about living quarters and an event or exposure not arising from the operation of a railroad was the cause;

(2) At the time of the injury or illness, the employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general public rather than as an employee; or

(3) The injury or illness is caused by a motor vehicle accident and occurs on a company parking lot or company access road while the employee is commuting to or from work.
