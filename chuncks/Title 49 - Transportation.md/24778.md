####### Test procedure for on-board electrical isolation monitoring system.

S8.Prior to any impact test, the requirements of S5.4.4 for the on-board electrical isolation monitoring system shall be tested using the following procedure.

(1) The electric energy storage device is at the state-of-charge specified in S7.1.

(2) The switch or device that provides power from the electric energy storage/conversion system to the propulsion system is in the activated position or the ready-to-drive position.

(3) Determine the isolation resistance, Ri, of the high voltage source with the electrical isolation monitoring system using the procedure outlined in S7.6.2 through S7.6.7.

(4) Insert a resistor with resistance Ro equal to or greater than 1/(1/(95 times the working voltage of the high voltage source)-1/Ri) and less than 1/(1/(100 times the working voltage of the high voltage source)-1/Ri) between the positive terminal of the high voltage source and the electrical chassis.

(5) The electrical isolation monitoring system indicator shall display a warning visible to the driver seated in the driver's designated seating position.
