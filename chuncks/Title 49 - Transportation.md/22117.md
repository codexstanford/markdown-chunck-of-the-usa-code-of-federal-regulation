####### Assembly and adjustment of test apparatus.

(c)

(1) When using a shoe and drum type apparatus, adjust the brake shoe toe clearances to 1.0 +/-0.1 mm (0.040 +/-0.004 inch). Fill the system with brake fluid, bleeding all wheel cylinders and the pressure gage to remove entrapped air. Operate the actuator manually to apply a pressure greater than the required operating pressure and inspect the system for leaks. Adjust the actuator and/or pressure relief valve to obtain a pressure of 6895 kPa +/-345 kPa (1,000 +/-50 p.s.i.). A smooth pressure stroke pattern is required when using a shoe and drum type apparatus. The pressure is relatively low during the first part of the stroke and then builds up smoothly to the maximum stroking pressure at the end of the stroke, to permit the primary cup to pass the compensating hole at a relatively low pressure. Using stroking fixtures, adjust the actuator and/or pressure relief valve to obtain a pressure of 6895 kPa +/-345 kPa (1,000 +/-50 p.s.i.).

(2) Adjust the stroking rate to 1,000 +/-100 strokes per hour. Record the fluid level in the master cylinder standpipe.
