(b)The environmental regulations at 49 CFR part 1105 must be complied with fully. An environmental report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.7(e), as well as an historic report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.8(d), must be filed either before or at the same time as the notice of exemption is filed.49 CFR 1105.7(a). The entity seeking the exemption authority must also serve copies of the environmental report on the agencies listed at 49 CFR 1105.7(b). Because the environmental report must include a certification that appropriate agencies have been consulted in its preparation (49 CFR 1105.7(c)), parties should begin environmental and historic consultations well before the notice of exemption is filed. Environmental requirements may be waived or modified where a petitioner demonstrates in writing that such action is appropriate.49 CFR 1105.10(c). It is to the advantage of parties to consult with the Board's Office of Environmental Analysis (OEA) at the earliest possible date to begin environmental review.
