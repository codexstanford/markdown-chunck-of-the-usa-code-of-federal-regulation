####### Adjustable seats.

S4.6(a) A vehicle that is equipped with a forward-facing rear designated seating position that can be relocated such that it is capable of being used at either an outboard or non-outboard forward-facing seating position shall be considered as having a forward-facing non-outboard seating position. Such an adjustable seat must be equipped with a tether anchorage (with or without the lower anchorages of a child restraint anchorage system) if the vehicle does not have another forward-facing non-outboard seating position that is so equipped.

(b) Tether and lower anchorages shall be available for use at all times, except when the seating position for which it is installed is not available for use because the vehicle seat has been removed or converted to an alternate use such as the carrying of cargo.
