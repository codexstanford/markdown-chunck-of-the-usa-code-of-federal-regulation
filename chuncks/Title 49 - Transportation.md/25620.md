####### Electronic stability control system

for buses, emergency vehicles, and medium/heavy vehicles means a system that has all the following attributes:

(i) Augments vehicle directional stability by applying and adjusting the vehicle brake torques individually at each wheel position on at least one front and at least one rear axle of the vehicle to induce correcting yaw moment to limit vehicle oversteer and to limit vehicle understeer;

(ii) Enhances rollover stability by applying and adjusting the vehicle brake torques individually at each wheel position on at least one front and at least one rear axle of the vehicle to reduce lateral acceleration of a vehicle;

(iii) Is computer-controlled with the computer using a closed-loop algorithm to induce correcting yaw moment and enhance rollover stability;

(iv) Has a means to determine the vehicle's lateral acceleration;

(v) Has a means to determine the vehicle's yaw rate and to estimate its side slip or side slip derivative with respect to time;

(vi) Has a means to estimate vehicle mass or, if applicable, combination vehicle mass;

(vii) Has a means to monitor driver steering input;

(viii) Has a means to modify engine torque, as necessary, to assist the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle and/or combination vehicle; and

(ix) Can provide brake pressure to automatically apply on a truck tractor and modulate the brake torques of a towed semi-trailer.
