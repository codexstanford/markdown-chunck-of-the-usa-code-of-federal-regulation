###### ยง 572.145 Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.

(a) The test objective is to determine the resistance of the lumbar spine and abdomen of a fully assembled dummy (drawing 210-0000) to flexion articulation between upper and lower halves of the torso assembly (refer to ยง 572.140(a)(1)(iv)).

(b)(1) When the upper half of the torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the occipital condyle level through the rigidly attached adaptor bracket in accordance with the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper half of the torso, as measured at the posterior surface of the torso reference plane shown in Figure P5 of this subpart, to translate in angular motion in the midsagittal plane 45 +/-0.5 degrees relative to the vertical transverse plane, at which time the pulling force applied must not be less than 130 N (28.8 lbf) and not more than 180 N (41.2 lbf), and

(2) Upon removal of the force, the upper torso assembly returns to within 10 degrees of its initial position.
