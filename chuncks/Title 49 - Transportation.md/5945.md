######## Acceptable physical test results.

(k)Results of physical tests must conform to the following:

(1) The tensile strength may not exceed 155,000 p.s.i.

(2) The elongation must be at least 16 percent for a two-inch gage length.

(3) The Charpy V-notch impact properties for the three impact specimens which must be tested at 0 &#xB0;F may not be less than the values shown as follows:

(4) After the final heat treatment, each vessel must be hardness tested on the cylindrical section. The tensile strength equivalent of the hardness number obtained may not be more than 165,000 p.s.i. (Rc 36). When the result of a hardness test exceeds the maximum permitted, two or more retests may be made; however, the hardness number obtained in each retest may not exceed the maximum permitted.
