###### i.e.

(4) If you obtain DBE participation that exceeds your overall goal in two consecutive years through the use of contract goals (, not through the use of race-neutral means alone), you must reduce your use of contract goals proportionately in the following year.

(g) In any year in which you project meeting part of your goal through race-neutral means and the remainder through contract goals, you must maintain data separately on DBE achievements in those contracts with and without contract goals, respectively. You must report this data to the concerned operating administration as provided in ยง 26.11.
