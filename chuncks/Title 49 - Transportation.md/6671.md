####### ยง 178.503 Marking of packagings.
######## Marking of reconditioned packagings.

(c)(1) If a packaging is reconditioned, it shall be marked by the reconditioner near the marks required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section with the following additional information:

(i) The name of the country in which the reconditioning was performed (in the United States, use the letters "USA");

(ii) The name and address or symbol of the reconditioner. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator;

(iii) The last two digits of the year of reconditioning;

(iv) The letter "R"; and

(v) For every packaging successfully passing a leakproofness test, the additional letter "L".

(2) When, after reconditioning, the markings required by paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section no longer appear on the top head or the side of the metal drum, the reconditioner must apply them in a durable form followed by the markings in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. These markings may identify a different performance capability than that for which the original design type had been tested and marked, but may not identify a greater performance capability. The markings applied in accordance with this paragraph may be different from those which are permanently marked on the bottom of a drum in accordance with paragraph (a)(10) of this section.
