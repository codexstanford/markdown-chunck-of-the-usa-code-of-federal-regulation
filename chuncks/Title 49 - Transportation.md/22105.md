####### Braking pressure actuation mechanism.

(b)An actuating mechanism for applying a force to the master cylinder pushrod without side thrust. The amount of force applied by the actuating mechanism shall be adjustable and capable of applying sufficient thrust to the master cylinder to create a pressure of at least 6895 kPa (1,000 p.s.i.) in the simulated brake system. A hydraulic gage or pressure recorder, having a range of at least 0 to 6895 kPa (0 to 1,000 p.s.i), shall be installed between the master cylinder and the brake assemblies and shall be provided with a shutoff valve and with a bleeding valve for removing air from the connecting tubing. The actuating mechanism shall be designed to permit adjustable stroking rates of approximately 1,000 strokes per hour. Use a mechanical or electrical counter to record the total number of strokes.
