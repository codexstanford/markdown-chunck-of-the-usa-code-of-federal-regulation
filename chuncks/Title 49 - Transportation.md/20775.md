####### Calculation of expansion at 1,000 and 1,500 psi.

S6.1.3(a) Adjust the fluid level in the burette to zero.

(b) Close the valve to the burette, apply pressure at the rate of 15,000 psi per minute, and seal 1,000 psi in the hose (1,500 psi in the second series, and 2,900 psi in the third series).

(c) After 3 seconds open the valve to the burette for 10 seconds and allow the fluid in the expanded hose to rise into the burette.

(d) Repeat the procedure in steps (b) and (c) twice. Measure the amount of test fluid which has accumulated in the burette as a result of the three applications of pressure.

(e) Calculate the volumetric expansion per foot by dividing the total accumulated test fluid by 3 and further dividing by the free length of the hose in feet.
