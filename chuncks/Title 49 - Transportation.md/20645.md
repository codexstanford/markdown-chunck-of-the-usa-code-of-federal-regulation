####### Directly Controlled Wheel

means a wheel for which the degree of rotational wheel slip is sensed, either at that wheel or on the axle shaft for that wheel and corresponding signals are transmitted to one or more modulators that adjust the brake actuating forces at that wheel. Each modulator may also adjust the brake actuating forces at other wheels that are on the same axle or in the same axle set in response to the same signal or signals.
