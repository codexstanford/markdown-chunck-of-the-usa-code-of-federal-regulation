####### Guard Energy Absorption.

S5.2.2

(a) A guard, other than a hydraulic guard or one installed on a tanker trailer, when subjected to a uniform distributed load applied in accordance with S6.6(c) of this section:

(1) Shall absorb by plastic deformation at least 20,000 J of energy within the first 125 mm of deflection without eliminating any load path that existed before the test was initiated; and

(2) Have a ground clearance not exceeding 560 mm, measured at each support to which the horizontal member is attached, as shown in Figure 4 of this section, after completion of the load application.

(b) A guard, other than a hydraulic guard or one installed on a tanker trailer, that demonstrates resistance to a uniform distributed load greater than 700,000 N applied in accordance with S6.6(b) of this section, need not meet the energy absorption requirements of S5.2.2(a) of this section but must have a ground clearance not exceeding 560 mm at each vertical support to which the horizontal member is attached after completion of the 700,000 N load application.
