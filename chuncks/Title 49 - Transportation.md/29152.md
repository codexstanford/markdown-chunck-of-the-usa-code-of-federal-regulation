###### Extraordinary Items.

(d)(1)All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.

Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.

Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.

Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
