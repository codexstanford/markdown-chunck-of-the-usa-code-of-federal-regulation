####### Test conditions for testing the lower anchorages.

S10.The test conditions described in this paragraph apply to the test procedures in S11.

(a) Adjust vehicle seats to their full rearward and full downward position and place the seat backs in their most upright position. When SFAD 2 is used in testing and cannot be attached to the lower anchorages with the seat back in this position, adjust the seat back as recommended by the manufacturer in its instructions for attaching child restraints. If no instructions are provided, adjust the seat back to the position closest to the upright position that enables SFAD 2 to attach to the lower anchorages.

(b) Head restraints are adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, provided pursuant to S12, as to how the head restraints should be adjusted when using the child restraint anchorage system. If instructions with regard to head restraint adjustment are not provided pursuant to S12, the head restraints are adjusted to any position.
