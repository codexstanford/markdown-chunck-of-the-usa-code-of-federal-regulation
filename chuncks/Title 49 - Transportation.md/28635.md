###### ยง 1132.1 Protest against collective ratemaking actions.
####### Content.

(a)The protested collective ratemaking action sought to be suspended, whether or not contained in a tariff filed with the Board, should be identified by making reference to: The name of the publishing carrier or collective ratemaking organization; the identification of the tariff, if applicable, or the identification of the collective ratemaking action publication if it is not contained in a tariff filed with the Board; the specific items or particular provisions protested; and the effective date of the tariff or other collective ratemaking action publication. Reference should also be made to the tariff or collective ratemaking action, and the specific provisions proposed to be superseded. The protest should state the grounds in support thereof, and indicate in what respect the protested collective ratemaking action is considered to be unlawful. Such protests will be considered as addressed to the discretion of the Board. Should a protestant desire to proceed further against a collective ratemaking action which is not suspended, or which has been suspended and the suspension vacated, a separate later formal complaint or petition should be filed.
