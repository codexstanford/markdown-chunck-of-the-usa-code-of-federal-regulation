(3) Install the tubing completely over the pins of the holding device so that the tubing is bent 180 degrees. If the tubing has a natural curvature, the tubing shall be bent in the direction of the natural curvature.

(4) Condition the holding device and tubing in an air oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) for 24 hours. Remove the holding device and tubing and allow to cool at room temperature for thirty minutes.

(5) With the tubing still mounted to the holding device, measure the elliptical minor diameter of the tubing at the reference mark to determine the final outside diameter.
