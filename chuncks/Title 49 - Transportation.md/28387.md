####### ยง 1108.29 Decisions.
######## Maximum lawful rate.

(2)Subject to the requirements on inadmissible evidence in ยง 1108.27(e)(2), in determining the issue of maximum lawful rate, the arbitration panel under this subpart shall consider the Board's methodologies for setting maximum lawful rates, giving due consideration to the need for differential pricing to permit a rail carrier to collect adequate revenues (as determined under 49 U.S.C. 10704(a)(2)). The arbitration panel may otherwise base its decision on the Board's existing rate review methodologies, revised versions of those methodologies, new methodologies, or market-based factors, including, for example: rate levels on comparative traffic; market factors for similar movements of the same commodity; and overall costs of providing the rail service. The arbitration panel's decision must be consistent with sound principles of rail regulation economics.
