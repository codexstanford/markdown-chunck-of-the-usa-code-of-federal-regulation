####### Guidelines for determining locations where necessary repairs can be performed.

(f)The following guidelines will be considered by FRA when determining whether a location is a location where repairs to a car's brake system or components can be performed and whether a location is the nearest location where the needed repairs can be effectuated.

(1) The following general factors and guidelines will be considered when making determinations as to whether a location is a location where brake repairs can be performed:

(i) The accessibility of the location to persons responsible for making repairs;

(ii) The presence of hazardous conditions that affect the ability to safely make repairs of the type needed at the location;

(iii) The nature of the repair necessary to bring the car into compliance;

(iv) The need for railroads to have in place an effective means to ensure the safe and timely repair of equipment;

(v) The relevant weather conditions at the location that affect accessibility or create hazardous conditions;

(vi) A location need not have the ability to effectuate every type of brake system repair in order to be considered a location where some brake repairs can be performed;

(vii) A location need not be staffed continuously in order to be considered a location where brake repairs can be performed;

(viii) The ability of a railroad to perform repair track brake tests or single car tests at a location shall not be considered; and

(ix) The congestion of work at a location shall not be considered

(2) The general factors and guidelines outlined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section should be applied to the following locations:

(i) A location where a mobile repair truck is used on a regular basis;

(ii) A location where a mobile repair truck originates or is permanently stationed;

(iii) A location at which a railroad performs mechanical repairs other than brake system repairs; and

(iv) A location that has an operative repair track or repair shop;

(3) In determining whether a location is the nearest location where the necessary brake repairs can be made, the distance to the location is a key factor but should not be considered the determining factor. The distance to a location must be considered in conjunction with the factors and guidance outlined in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section. In addition, the following safety factors must be considered in order to optimize safety:

(i) The safety of the employees responsible for getting the equipment to or from a particular location; and

(ii) The potential safety hazards involved with moving the equipment in the direction of travel necessary to get the equipment to a particular location.
