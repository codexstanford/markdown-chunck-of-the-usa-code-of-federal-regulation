5. For purposes of this block and blocks 6, 8, and 9, the participation categories listed at the left of the block are the following: "Prime Concessions" are concessions who have a direct relationship with the airport (a company who has a lease agreement directly with the airport to operate a concession). A "subconcession" is a firm that has a sublease or other agreement with a prime concessionaire, rather than with the airport itself, to operate a concession at the airport. A "management contract" is an agreement between the airport and a firm to manage a portion of the airport's facilities or operations (manage the parking facilities). "Goods/services" refers to those goods and services purchased by the airport itself or by concessionaires and management contractors from certified DBEs.
