If the rate of heat production exceeds the rate of heat loss, then the temperature of the substance will rise which, after an induction time, may lead to self-ignition and combustion. A material of this type which exhibits spontaneous ignition or if the temperature of the sample exceeds 200 &#xB0;C (392 &#xB0;F) during the 24-hour test period when tested in accordance with UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR;ยง 171.7 of this subchapter), is classed as a Division 4.2 material.
