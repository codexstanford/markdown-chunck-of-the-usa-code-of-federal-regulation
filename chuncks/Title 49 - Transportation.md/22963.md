However, a vehicle counted toward compliance with S7.1 may not be counted toward compliance with S7.2. If the vehicle manufacturer decides to exercise the option for carry-backward credits, the manufacturer must indicate this in its report for the production period corresponding to S7.1 filed pursuant to 49 CFR 585.66. The vehicles are counted in fulfillment of the requirements of S7.1, subject to actually being produced in compliance with this standard during the specified time period and not being counted toward the requirements of S7.2.
