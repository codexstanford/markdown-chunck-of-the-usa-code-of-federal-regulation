######## with not less than 8 percent but less than 20 percent hydrogen peroxide (stabilized as necessary);,with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide;,with more than 40 percent but not more than 60 percent hydrogen peroxide;,with acids, water and not more than 5 percent peroxyacetic acid;

(A) Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutionsHydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutionsHydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutionsHydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid mixtures, stabilizedOrganic peroxide type D, liquid; Organic peroxide type E, liquid; Organic peroxide type F, liquid;

(B) Dichlorosilane, Silicon tetrachloride, and Trichlorosilane; and

(C) Organometallic substance, solid, pyrophoric; Organometallic substance, liquid, pyrophoric; Organometallic substance, solid, pyrophoric, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, liquid, pyrophoric, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive, flammable; Organometallic substance, solid, water-reactive, self-heating; Organometallic substance, liquid, water-reactive; Organometallic substance, liquid, water-reactive, flammable; and Organometallic substance, solid, self-heating.

(5) Whenever hazardous materials are stowed together, whether or not in a cargo transport unit, the segregation of such hazardous materials from others must always be in accordance with the most restrictive requirements for any of the hazardous materials concerned.

(6) When the § 172.101 Table or § 172.402 requires packages to bear a subsidiary hazard label or labels, the segregation appropriate to the subsidiary hazards must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that required by the primary hazard. For the purposes of this paragraph, the segregation requirements corresponding to an explosive subsidiary hazard are-except for organic peroxides which are those corresponding to Division 1.3-those for Division 1.4 (explosive) materials.

(7) Where, for the purposes of segregation, terms such as "away from" a particular hazard class are used in the § 172.101 Table, the segregation requirement applies to:

(i) All hazardous materials within the hazard class; and

(ii) All hazardous materials for which a secondary hazard label of that class is required.

(8) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section, hazardous materials of the same class may be stowed together without regard to segregation required by secondary hazards (subsidiary risk label(s)), provided the substances do not react dangerously with each other and cause:

(i) Combustion and/or evolution of considerable heat;

(ii) Evolution of flammable, toxic or asphyxiant gases;

(iii) The formation of corrosive substances; or

(iv) The formation of unstable substances.

(9) Stowage in a shelter-'tween deck cargo space is not considered to be "on deck" stowage.

(10) Where the code in column (10B) of the § 172.101 Table specifies that "Segregation as for. . ." applies, the segregation requirements applicable to that class in the § 176.83(b) General Segregation Table must be applied. However, for the purposes of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, which permits substances of the same class to be stowed together provided they do not react dangerously with each other, the segregation requirements of the class as represented by the primary hazard class in the § 172.101 Table entry must be applied.

(11) Certain exceptions from segregation for waste cyanides or waste cyanide mixtures or solutions transported with acids; waste Division 4.2 materials transported with Class 8 liquids; and waste Division 6.1 Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A material transported with waste Class 3 material, Class 8 liquids, and Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 or 5.2 material are set forth in § 173.12(e) of this subchapter.
