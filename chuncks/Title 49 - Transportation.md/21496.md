####### Tristimulus method procedure.

S14.4.1.4.1

S14.4.1.4.1.1 The color of light from the H-V point of a sample device must be measured by photoelectric receivers with spectral responses that approximate CIE standard spectral tristimulus valves.

S14.4.1.4.1.2 A sphere may be used to integrate light from a colored source provided that the color shift that results from the spectral selectivity of the sphere paint be corrected by the use of a filter, correction factor, or an appropriate calibration.

S14.4.1.4.1.3 Where the sample device does not have uniform spectral characteristics in all useful directions, color measurements must be made at as many directions of view as are required to evaluate the color for those directions that apply to the end use of the device.
