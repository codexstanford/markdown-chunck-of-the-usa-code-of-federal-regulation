##### 16. Opening Building Doors.,i.e.,

For paratransit services, a passenger's request for the driver to open an exterior entry door to a building to provide boarding and/or alighting assistance to a passenger with a disability should generally be granted as long as providing this assistance would not pose a direct threat, or leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time.Note that a request for "door-through-door" service (assisting the passenger past the door to the building) generally would not need to be granted because it could rise to the level of a fundamental alteration.
