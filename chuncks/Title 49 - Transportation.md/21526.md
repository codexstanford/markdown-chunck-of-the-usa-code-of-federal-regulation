####### Abrading pad.

S14.6.1.1.1A new, unused abrading pad constructed of 0000 steel wool not less than 2.5 +/-.1 cm wide, rubber cemented to a rigid base shaped to the same vertical contour of the lens, is used for each test. The abrading pad support is equal in size to the pad and the center of the support surface is within +/-2 mm of parallel to the lens surface. The "grain" of the pad is oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion. The density of the pad is such that when the pad is resting unweighted on the lens, the base of the pad is no closer than 3.2 mm to the lens at its closest point.
