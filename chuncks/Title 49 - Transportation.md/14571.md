####### Mitigation strategies.

(c)(1) As part of its risk-based HMP, a railroad shall design and implement mitigation strategies that improve safety by:

(i) Mitigating or eliminating aspects of a railroad's system that increase risks identified in the risk-based hazard analysis; and

(ii) Enhancing aspects of a railroad's system that decrease risks identified in the risk-based hazard analysis.

(2) A railroad may use pilot projects, including pilot projects conducted by other railroads, to determine whether quantitative data suggests that a particular mitigation strategy has potential to succeed on a full-scale basis.
