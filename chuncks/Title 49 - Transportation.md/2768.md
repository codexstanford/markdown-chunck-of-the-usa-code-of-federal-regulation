##### ยง 40.271 How are alcohol testing problems corrected?

(a) As a BAT or STT, you have the responsibility of trying to complete successfully an alcohol test for each employee.

(1) If, during or shortly after the testing process, you become aware of any event that will cause the test to be cancelled (see ยง 40.267), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if practicable. You may repeat the testing process as part of this effort.
