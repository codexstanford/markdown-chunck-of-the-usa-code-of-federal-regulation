####### Full-height collision post, corner post,

or side frame post means any vertical framing member in the rail car body structure that spans the distance between the underframe and the roof at the car body section where the post is located. For collision posts located at the approximate third points laterally of an end frame, the term "full-height" applies to posts that extend and connect to supporting structural members in the roof at the location of the posts, or to a beam connected to the top of the end-frame and supported by the roof rails (or anti-telescoping plate), or to both.
