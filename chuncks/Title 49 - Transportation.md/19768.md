###### Conversion to high-roof configurations.

(12)Secondary vehicle manufacturers that qualify as small manufacturers may convert low- and mid-roof tractors to high-roof configurations without recertification for the purpose of building a custom sleeper tractor or converting it to run on natural gas, as follows:

(i) The original low- or mid-roof tractor must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity by EPA.

(ii) The modifications may not increase the frontal area of the tractor beyond the frontal area of the equivalent high-roof tractor with the corresponding standard trailer. If a manufacturer cannot use the original manufacturer's roof fairing for the high-roof tractor, use good engineering judgment to achieve similar or better aerodynamic performance.

(iii) The agencies may require that these manufacturers submit annual production reports as described in ยง 535.8 and 40 CFR 1037.250 indicating the original roof height for requalified vehicles.
