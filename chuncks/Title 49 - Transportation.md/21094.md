####### Ratio to parking lamps and clearance lamps.

S7.1.1.12

S7.1.1.12.1 When a parking lamp, or a clearance lamp on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, trailer, or bus of 2032 mm or more in overall width, is combined with a front turn signal lamp, the luminous intensity of the front turn signal lamp at each identified test point must not be less than the luminous intensity of the parking lamp or clearance lamp at that same test point times the multiplier shown for that test point in Tables VI-a or VI-b.

S7.1.1.12.2 If a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used on a passenger car or on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or trailer of less than 2032 mm in overall width, and the distance between the optical axes for both the parking lamp and turn signal lamp is within 560 mm for two compartment or lamp arrangements or 410 mm for three compartment or lamp arrangements, then the ratio must be computed with all compartments or lamps lighted.

S7.1.1.12.3 If a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used and the distance between optical axes for one of the functions exceeds 560 mm for two compartment or lamp arrangements or 410 mm for three compartments or lamp arrangements, then the ratio must be computed for only those compartments or lamps where the parking lamp and turn signal lamp are optically combined.

S7.1.1.12.4 Where the clearance lamp is combined with the turn signal lamp, and the maximum luminous intensity of the clearance lamp is located below horizontal and within an area generated by a 1.0 degree radius around a test point, the ratio for the test point may be computed using the lowest value of the clearance lamp luminous intensity within the generated area.
