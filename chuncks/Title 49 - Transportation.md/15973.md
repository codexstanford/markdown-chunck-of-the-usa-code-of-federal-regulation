####### ยง 382.305 Random testing.
######## e.g.,

(j)(1)To calculate the total number of covered drivers eligible for random testing throughout the year, as an employer, you must add the total number of covered drivers eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all covered drivers must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (daily, weekly, bi-weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of covered drivers rate more than on a once per month basis.
