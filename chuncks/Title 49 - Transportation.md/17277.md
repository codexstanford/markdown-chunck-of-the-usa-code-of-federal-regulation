####### ยง 390.23 Relief from regulations.
######## Regional emergencies.

(1)(i) The exemption provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section is effective only when:

(A) An emergency has been declared by the President of the United States, the Governor of a State, or their authorized representatives having authority to declare emergencies; or

(B) FMCSA has declared that a regional emergency exists which justifies an exemption from parts 390 through 399 of this chapter.

(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section and ยง 390.25, the exemption shall not exceed the duration of the motor carrier's or driver's direct assistance in providing emergency relief, or 30 days from the date of the initial declaration of the emergency or the exemption from the regulations by FMCSA, whichever is less.

(B) If a Governor who declares an emergency caused by a shortage of residential heating fuel (namely heating oil, natural gas, and propane), subsequently determines at the end of the 30-day period immediately following the declaration that the emergency shortage has not ended, and extends the declaration of an emergency for up to 2 additional 30-day periods, this exemption shall remain in effect up to the end of such additional periods, not to exceed 60 additional days, for a motor carrier or driver providing residential heating fuel in the geographic area designated by the Governor's declaration of emergency.
