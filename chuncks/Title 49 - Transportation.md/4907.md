####### ยง 173.230 Fuel cell cartridges containing hazardous material.
######## Hydrogen cycling test.

(iii)A fuel cell cartridge must be subjected to a hydrogen cycling test to ensure that the design stress limits are not exceeded during use. The fuel cell cartridge must be cycled from not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity to not less than 95% rated hydrogen capacity and back to not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity. The rated charging pressure must be used for charging and temperatures must be within the operating temperature range. The cycling must be continued for at least 100 cycles. Following the cycling test the fuel cell cartridge must be charged and the water volume displaced by the cartridge must be measured. The cartridge design is deemed to pass the test if the water volume displaced by the cycled cartridge does not exceed the water volume displaced by an uncycled cartridge charged to 95% rated capacity and pressurized to 75% of its minimum shell burst pressure.
