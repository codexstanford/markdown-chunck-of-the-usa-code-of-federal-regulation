###### Floating Operations

(b)refers to operations of water vessels and equipment in revenue service. They include the operation of carferries, tugs, barges, lighterage, and all other forms of water craft.

Floating operations exclude operations includable in the Administrative Support Operations subactivity, and the switching transfer of cars between general yards or trains and the facility or a dedicated yard serving the facility, or switching within the dedicated supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews. They also do not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or General and Administrative activities.

Floating operations should be classified by line and terminal operations. The distribution should be made based on the nature of the operation and not the facility or equipment. When the service occurs between distinct terminals, the operation should be considered a line operation. When the service is conducted within a general terminal or harbor area, the operation should be considered a terminal operation.
