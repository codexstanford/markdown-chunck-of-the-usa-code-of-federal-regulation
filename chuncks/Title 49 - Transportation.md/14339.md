###### Settlement.

(c)(1) Settlement under the grant agreement is made on the basis of a Federal audit which has determined the allowable costs over the entire term of the grant agreement. If the Federal audit determines that the allowable costs under the grant agreement are less than the amount of the grant, the difference shall be refunded to FRA at the end of the fiscal year in which the audit was made unless it has become the subject of another executed grant agreement. Upon termination of a State's participation in the Rail Service Assistance Program, the State shall repay FRA the Federal share of any unused rehabilitation and improvement assistance and any accumulated interest.
