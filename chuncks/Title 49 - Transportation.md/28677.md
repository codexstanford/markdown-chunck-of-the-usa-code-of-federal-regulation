######## Waivers.

(a)Prior to filing an application, prospective applicants may seek an advance waiver, either on a permanent or temporary basis, of required information which is unavailable or not necessary or useful in analysis of the proposal. However, if the information is clearly not applicable to the individual proposal, a waiver is not necessary and need not be sought. A petition must specify the sections for which waiver or clarification is sought and the reasons why it should be granted. No replies will be permitted. Parties may, upon an appropriate showing, demonstrate their need to examine data which have previously been waived. In such circumstances, the Board only requires that it be produced under ยง 1150.8 above.
