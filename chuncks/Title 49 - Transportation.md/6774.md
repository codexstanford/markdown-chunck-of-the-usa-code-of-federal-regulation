######## Minimum wall thickness.

(iv)For metal IBCs with a capacity of more than 1500 liters, the minimum wall thickness must be determined as follows:

(A) For a reference steel having a product of Rm x Ao = 10,000, where Ao is the minimum elongation (as a percentage) of the reference steel to be used on fracture under tensile stress (Rm x Ao = 10,000 x 145; if tensile strength is in U.S. Standard units of pounds per square inch), the wall thickness must not be less than:

(B) For metals other than the reference steel described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the minimum wall thickness is the greater of 1.5 mm (0.059 inches) or as determined by use of the following equivalence formula:

(C) For purposes of the calculation described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the metal to be used (Rm) must be the minimum value according to material standards. However, for austenitic (stainless) steels, the specified minimum value for Rm, according to the material standards, may be increased by up to 15% when a greater value is provided in the material inspection certificate. When no material standard exists for the material in question, the value of Rm must be the minimum value indicated in the material inspection certificate.
