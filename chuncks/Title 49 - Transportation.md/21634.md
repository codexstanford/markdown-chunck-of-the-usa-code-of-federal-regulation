####### Procedure.

S14.9.1.2

S14.9.1.2.1 The sample unit is operated with the maximum bulb load it will experience on the vehicle on which it will be installed. Bulbs that fail during the test are replaced. The turn signal flasher is not to be included in the test circuit. When the unit includes a self-canceling means, the test equipment is arranged so that the unit will be turned "off" in its normal operating manner.

S14.9.1.2.2 The test is conducted at a rate not to exceed 15 complete cycles per minute. One complete cycle consists of the following sequence: Off, left turn, off, right turn, and return to off.

S14.9.1.2.3 The voltage drop from the input terminal of the device to each lamp output terminal, including 3 in of 16 or 18 gage wire, is measured at the start of the test, at intervals of not more than 25,000 cycles during the test, and at the completion of the test.
