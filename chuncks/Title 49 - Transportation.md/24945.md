###### ยง 572.16 Head.

(a) The head consists of the assembly designated as SA 103C 010 on drawing No. SA 103C 001, and conforms to either-

(1) Each item specified on drawing SA 103C 002(B), sheet 8; or

(2) Each item specified on drawing SA 103C 002, sheet 8.

(b) When the head is impacted by a test probe specified in ยง 572.21(a)(1) at 7 fps, then the peak resultant acceleration measured at the location of the accelerometer mounted in the headform according to ยง 572.21(b) is not less than 95g and not more than 118g.

(1) The recorded acceleration-time curve for this test is unimodal at or above the 50g level, and lies at or above that level for intervals:

(i) In the case of the head assembly specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, not less than 1.3 milliseconds and not more than 2.0 milliseconds;

(ii) In the case of the head assembly specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, not less than 2.0 milliseconds and not more than 3.0 milliseconds.

(2) The lateral acceleration vector does not exceed 7g.
