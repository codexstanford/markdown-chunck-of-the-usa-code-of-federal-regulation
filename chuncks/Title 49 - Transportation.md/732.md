##### ยง 23.51 How are a recipient's overall goals expressed and calculated?
###### i.e.

(e) You are not required to obtain prior FAA concurrence with your overall goal (, with the number itself). However, if the FAA's review suggests that your overall goal has not been correctly calculated, or that your method for calculating goals is inadequate, the FAA may, after consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or require that you do so. The adjusted overall goal is binding on you.

(f) If you need additional time to collect data or take other steps to develop an approach to setting overall goals, you may request the approval of the FAA Administrator for an interim goal and/or goal-setting mechanism. Such a mechanism must:

(1) Reflect the relative availability of ACDBEs in your local market area to the maximum extent feasible given the data available to you; and

(2) Avoid imposing undue burdens on non-ACDBEs.
