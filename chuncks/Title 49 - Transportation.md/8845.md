######### What is an information analysis?,see

(g)In periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of its entire pipeline and the consequences of a possible failure along the pipeline. Operators must continue to comply with the data integration elements specified in ยง 195.452(g) that were in effect on October 1, 2018, until October 1, 2022. Operators must begin to integrate all the data elements specified in this section starting October 1, 2020, with all attributes integrated by October 1, 2022. This analysis must:

(1) Integrate information and attributes about the pipeline that include, but are not limited to:

(i) Pipe diameter, wall thickness, grade, and seam type;

(ii) Pipe coating, including girth weld coating;

(iii) Maximum operating pressure (MOP) and temperature;

(iv) Endpoints of segments that could affect high consequence areas (HCAs);

(v) Hydrostatic test pressure including any test failures or leaks-if known;

(vi) Location of casings and if shorted;

(vii) Any in-service ruptures or leaks-including identified causes;

(viii) Data gathered through integrity assessments required under this section;

(ix) Close interval survey (CIS) survey results;

(x) Depth of cover surveys;

(xi) Corrosion protection (CP) rectifier readings;

(xii) CP test point survey readings and locations;

(xiii) AC/DC and foreign structure interference surveys;

(xiv) Pipe coating surveys and cathodic protection surveys.
