####### Preparation.

(b)Prepare an air brake tubing assembly with a free length of 6 inches (six inches of exposed tubing between the end fittings), with the end fittings installed in accordance with the end fitting manufacturer's instructions. If necessary install adapters on the end fittings to permit quick attachment to the machine, to keep water from entering the tubing assembly, and to ensure that the tubing assembly is in a straight position when installed on the machine. Fill the container with distilled water such that the lower 4 inches of exposed tubing will be submerged when the brake tubing assembly is installed on the machine. Heat the water until it boils. Then quickly install the plastic air brake tubing assembly on the machine with the lower end of the tubing assembly in the boiling water. After the water has boiled continuously for 5 minutes, apply tension to the tubing assembly at a rate of 1 inch per minute travel of the moving head until either the conditioned tensile load in Table VIII for the size of tubing being tested is reached or the free length of the tubing assembly reaches 9 inches, whichever occurs first.
