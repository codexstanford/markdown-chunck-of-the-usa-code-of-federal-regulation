####### ยง 192.712 Analysis of predicted failure pressure.
######## Cracks that survive pressure testing.

(3)For cases in which the operator does not have in-line inspection crack anomaly data and is analyzing potential crack defects that could have survived a pressure test, the operator must calculate the largest potential crack defect sizes using the methods in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If pipe material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must use one of the following for Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon minimum operational temperature and equivalent to a full-size specimen value:

(i) Charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;

(ii) A conservative Charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the material properties verification process specified in ยง 192.607;

(iii) A full size equivalent Charpy v-notch upper-shelf toughness level of 120 ft.-lbs.; or

(iv) Other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative Charpy v-notch toughness values of the crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. Operators using an assumed Charpy v-notch toughness value must notify PHMSA in accordance with ยง 192.18.
