S14.2.4

S14.2.4.1 Each DRL is tested to the procedure of S14.2.5 when a test voltage of 12.8 v +/-20 mv is applied to the input terminals of the lamp switch module or voltage-reducing equipment, whichever is closer to the electrical source on the vehicle.

S14.2.4.2 The test distance from the lamp to the photometer is not less than 18.3 m if the lamp is optically combined with a headlamp, or is a separate lamp, and not less than 3 m if the lamp is optically combined with a lamp, other than a headlamp, that is required by this standard.

S14.2.4.3 Except for a lamp having a sealed-in bulb, a lamp must meet the applicable requirements of this standard when tested with a bulb whose filament is positioned within +/-.010 in. of the nominal design position specified in SAE J573d, Lamp bulbs and Sealed Units, December 1968, (incorporated by reference, paragraph S5.2 of this section) or specified by the bulb manufacturer.
