####### Flexion.

(1)(i) Plane D, referenced in Figure T2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 76 degrees and 90 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 572.170), about the occipital condyles may not be less than 50 N-m (36.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 62 N-m (45.7 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m (7.4 ft-lbf) between 86 ms and 105 ms after time zero.

(ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = M- (0.01778) x (F).

(iii) Mis the moment about the y-axis in Newton-meters, Fis the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) in Newtons, and 0.01778 is the distance in meters from the load center of the neck transducer to the occipital condyle.
