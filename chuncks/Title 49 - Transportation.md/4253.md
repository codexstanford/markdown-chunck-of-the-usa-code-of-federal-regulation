####### ยง 173.9 Transport vehicles or freight containers containing lading which has been fumigated.

(a) For the purpose of this section, not including 49 CFR part 387, a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer in which the lading has been fumigated with any material, or is undergoing fumigation, is a package containing a hazardous material.

(b) No person may offer for transportation or transport a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer in which the lading has been fumigated or treated with any material, or is undergoing fumigation, unless the FUMIGANT marking specified in paragraph (e) of this section is prominently displayed so that it can be seen by any person attempting to enter the interior of the transport vehicle or freight container. For domestic transportation, a hazard warning label authorized by EPA under 40 CFR part 156 may be used as an alternative to the FUMIGANT marking.

(c) No person may affix or display on a rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer the FUMIGANT marking specified in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the lading has been fumigated or is undergoing fumigation.

(d) The FUMIGANT marking required by paragraph (b) of this section must remain on the rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer until the rail car, freight container, truck body, or trailer has been completely ventilated either by opening the doors of the unit or by mechanical ventilation to ensure no harmful concentration of gas remains after fumigation has been completed.
