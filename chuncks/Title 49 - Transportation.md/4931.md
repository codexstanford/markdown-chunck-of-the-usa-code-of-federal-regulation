(2)Each tank must be equipped with at least one pressure relief device, such as a spring-loaded valve or fusible plug, conforming to the following:

(i) Each pressure relief device must communicate with the vapor space of the tank when the tank is in a normal transportation attitude. Shutoff valves may not be installed between the tank opening and any pressure relief device. Pressure relief devices must be mounted, shielded, or drained to prevent the accumulation of any material that could impair the operation or discharge capability of the device;

(ii) Frangible devices are not authorized;

(iii) No pressure relief device may open at less than 34.4 kPa (5 psig);

(iv) If a fusible device is used for relieving pressure, the device must have a minimum area of 1.25 square inches. The device must function at a temperature between 104 &#xB0;C. and 149 &#xB0;C. (220 &#xB0;F. and 300 &#xB0;F.) and at a pressure less than the design test pressure of the tank, unless this latter function is accomplished by a separate device; and

(v) No relief device may be used which would release flammable vapors under normal conditions of transportation (temperature up to and including 54 &#xB0;C. (130 &#xB0;F.).); and
