####### Flattened rail

(12)means a short length of rail, not a joint, which has flattened out across the width of the rail head to a depth ofinch or more below the rest of the rail. Flattened rail occurrences have no repetitive regularity and thus do not include corrugations, and have no apparent localized cause such as a weld or engine burn. Their individual length is relatively short, as compared to a condition such as head flow on the low rail of curves.
