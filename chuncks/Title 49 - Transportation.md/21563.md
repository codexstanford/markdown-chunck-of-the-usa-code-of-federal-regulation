####### Procedure.

S14.6.9.1

S14.6.9.1.1 An unfixtured sample headlamp in its design mounting position is placed in water at a temperature of 176&#xB0; +/-5 &#xB0;F (80&#xB0; +/-3 &#xB0;C) for one hour. The headlamp is energized in its highest wattage mode, with the test voltage at 12.8 +/-0.1 V during immersion.

S14.6.9.1.2 The lamp is then de-energized and immediately submerged in its design mounting position into water at 32&#xB0; + 5&#xB0; -0 &#xB0;F (0&#xB0; + 3&#xB0; -0 &#xB0;C). The water is in a pressurized vessel, and the pressure is increased to 10 psi (70 kPa), upon placing the lamp in the water. The lamp must remain in the pressurized vessel for a period of thirty minutes.

S14.6.9.1.3 This entire procedure is repeated for four cycles.

S14.6.9.1.4 Then the lamp is inspected for any signs of water on its interior. During the high temperature portion of the cycles, the lamp is observed for signs of air escaping from its interior.
