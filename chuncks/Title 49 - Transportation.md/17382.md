The jurisdictional thresholds of the statutes FMCSA administers and the corresponding regulations are not uniform. First, for most of the FMCSRs, the Agency's jurisdiction is based upon the definition of(CMV) in the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (MCSA), codified at 49 U.S.C. 31132(1) and §§ 390.5T and 390.5. Under that definition, a passenger vehicle is aif it is designed or used to transport 9 or more passengers for compensation or 16 or more passengers regardless of compensation status. Larger passenger vehicles also qualify as CMVs irrespective of their passenger capacity if they have a gross vehicle weight (GVW) or gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) (whichever is greater) of 10,001 pounds or more. The Agency's safety jurisdiction, however, does not include passenger-carrying vehicles that meet all of the following criteria: (1) designed and used to transport 8 or fewer passengers, (2) have a GVWR and GVW of 10,000 pounds or less, and (3) are not transporting hazardous materials in a quantity that requires placarding. If a passenger-carrying vehicle exceeds even one of these three thresholds, however, FMCSA has safety jurisdiction over the vehicle.
