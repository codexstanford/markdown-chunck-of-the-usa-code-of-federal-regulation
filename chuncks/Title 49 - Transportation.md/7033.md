######## Coupler vertical restraint tests.

(c)A coupler vertical restraint system shall be tested under the following conditions:

(1) The test coupler shall be tested with a mating coupler (or simulated coupler) having only frictional vertical force resistance at the mating interface; or a mating coupler (or simulated coupler) having the capabilities described in paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) The testing apparatus shall simulate the vertical coupler performance at the mating interface and may not interfere with coupler failure or otherwise inhibit failure due to force applications and reactions; and

(3) The test shall be conducted as follows:

(i) A minimum of 200,000 pounds (90,718.5 kg) vertical downward load shall be applied continuously for at least 5 minutes to the test coupler head simultaneously with the application of a nominal 2,000 pounds (907.2 kg) buff load;

(ii) The procedures prescribed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, shall be repeated with a minimum vertical upward load of 200,000 pounds (90,718.5 kg); and

(iii) A minimum of three consecutive successful tests shall be performed for each load combination prescribed in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. A test is successful when a vertical disengagement or material failure does not occur during the application of any of the loads prescribed in this paragraph.
