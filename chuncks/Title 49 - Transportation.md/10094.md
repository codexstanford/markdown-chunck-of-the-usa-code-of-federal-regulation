See,§ 219.105, which is construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the unauthorized conduct of a regulated employee that violates § 219.101 or § 219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such conduct). Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. See FRA's website atfor a statement of agency civil penalty policy.
