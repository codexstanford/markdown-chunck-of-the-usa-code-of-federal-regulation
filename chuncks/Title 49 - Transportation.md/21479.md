S14.2.5.8.1 Test point positions are defined by the positioner. The following nomenclature applies:

S14.2.5.8.1.1 The letters "V" and "H" designate the vertical and horizontal planes intersecting both the headlamp light source and the photometer axis. "H-V" designates the zero test point angle at the intersection of the H and V planes. This intersection is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

S14.2.5.8.1.2 The letters "U", "D", "L", and "R", indicating up, down, left and right, respectively, designate the angular position from the H and V planes to the photometer as viewed from the headlamp.

S14.2.5.8.1.3 Horizontal angles designated L and R are defined as the plan view angle between the vertical plane and the projection of the light ray from the headlamp onto the horizontal plane.

S14.2.5.8.1.4 Vertical angles designated U and D are defined as the true angle between the horizontal plane and the light ray from the headlamp.
