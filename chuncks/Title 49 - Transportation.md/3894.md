####### § 172.101 Purpose and use of hazardous materials table.
######## Mixtures and solutions.

(10)(i) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified specifically by name, comprised of a single predominant hazardous material identified in the Table by technical name and one or more hazardous and/or non-hazardous material, must be described using the proper shipping name of the hazardous material and the qualifying word "mixture" or "solution", as appropriate, unless-

(A) Except as provided in § 172.101(i)(4) the packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate to the physical state of the material;

(B) The shipping description indicates that the proper shipping name applies only to the pure or technically pure hazardous material;

(C) The hazard class, packing group, or subsidiary hazard of the mixture or solution is different from that specified for the entry;

(D) There is a significant change in the measures to be taken in emergencies;

(E) The material is identified by special provision in Column 7 of the § 172.101 Table as a material poisonous by inhalation; however, it no longer meets the definition of poisonous by inhalation or it falls within a different hazard zone than that specified in the special provision; or

(F) The material can be appropriately described by a shipping name that describes its intended application, such as "Coating solution", "Extracts, flavoring" or "Compound, cleaning liquid.".

(ii) If one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(10)(i)(A) through (F) of this section is satisfied then the proper shipping name selection process in (c)(12)(ii) must be used.

(iii) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified in the Table specifically by name, comprised of two or more hazardous materials in the same hazard class, must be described using an appropriate shipping description (e.g., "Flammable liquid, n.o.s."). The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as "Alcohol, n.o.s." rather than "Flammable liquid, n.o.s.". Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as "Coating solution" or "Extracts, flavoring liquid" rather than by an n.o.s. entry. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical names of at least two components most predominately contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution may be required in association with the proper shipping name.

(11) Except for a material subject to or prohibited by § 173.21, § 173.54, § 173.56(d), § 173.56(e), § 173.224(c) or § 173.225(b) of this subchapter, a material that is considered to be a hazardous waste or a sample of a material for which the hazard class is uncertain and must be determined by testing may be assigned a tentative proper shipping name, hazard class, identification number and packing group, if applicable, based on the shipper's tentative determination according to:

(i) Defining criteria in this subchapter;

(ii) The hazard precedence prescribed in § 173.2a of this subchapter;

(iii) The shipper's knowledge of the material;

(iv) In addition to paragraphs (c)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section, for a sample of a material other than a waste, the following must be met:

(A) Except when the word "Sample" already appears in the proper shipping name, the word "Sample" must appear as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description on the shipping paper.

(B) When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a "G" in Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, and the primary constituent(s) for which the tentative classification is based are not known, the provisions requiring a technical name for the constituent(s) do not apply; and

(C) A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that conforms to the requirements of this subchapter that are applicable to the tentative packing group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package.

(12) Except when the proper shipping name in the Table is preceded by a plus (+)-

(i) If it is specifically determined that a material meets the definition of a hazard class, packing group or hazard zone, other than the class, packing group or hazard zone shown in association with the proper shipping name, or does not meet the defining criteria for a subsidiary hazard shown in Column 6 of the Table, the material shall be described by an appropriate proper shipping name listed in association with the correct hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard for the material.
