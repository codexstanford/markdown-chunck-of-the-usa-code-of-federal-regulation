####### Procedure.

S6.5.3.1(a) Heat a new 60 +/-1 ml. sample of the brake fluid to 185&#xB0; +/-2 &#xB0;C. (365&#xB0; +/-3.6 &#xB0;F.). Hold at this temperature for 120 +/-5 minutes. Bring to a reflux rate in excess of 1 drop per second within 5 minutes. The reflux rate should not exceed 5 drops per second at any time. Over the next 5 +/-2 minutes adjust the heating rate to obtain an equilibrium reflux rate of 1 to 2 drops per second. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, taking four temperature readings at 30-second intervals. Average these as the observed ERBP. If no reflux is evident when the fluid temperature reaches 260 &#xB0;C. (500 &#xB0;F), discontinue heating and report ERBP as in excess of 260 &#xB0;C. (500 &#xB0;F.).
