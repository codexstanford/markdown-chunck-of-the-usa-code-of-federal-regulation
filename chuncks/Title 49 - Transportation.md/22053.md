Stopper the bottle with an unused cork and place in the cold chamber at the higher storage temperature specified in Table II (S5.1.7(c)). After 144 +/-4 hours remove the bottle from the chamber, quickly wipe it with a clean, lint-free cloth, saturated with ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) or acetone. Examine the fluid for evidence of sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification. Invert the bottle and determine the number of seconds required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid. Let sample warm to room temperature and examine.
