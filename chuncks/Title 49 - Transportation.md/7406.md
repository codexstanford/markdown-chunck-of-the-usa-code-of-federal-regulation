######## Repair.

(b)The suitability of each repair affecting the structural integrity or lading retention capability of the cargo tank must be determined by the testing required either in the applicable manufacturing specification or in § 180.407(g)(1)(iv). Except for a repair performed by a facility in Canada in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, each repair of a cargo tank involving welding on the shell or head must be certified by a Registered Inspector. The following provisions apply to specific cargo tank repairs:

(1) DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect at the time of repair;

(2) MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, and MC 306 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 406 specification in effect at the time of repair;

(3) MC 304 and MC 307 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 407 specification in effect at the time of repair;

(4) MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with either the most recent revision of the original specification or with the DOT 412 specification in effect at the time of repair;

(5) MC 338 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the specification requirements in effect at the time of repair; and

(6) MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks must be repaired in accordance with the repair procedures described in CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) and the National Board Inspection Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each cargo tank having cracks or other defects requiring welded repairs must meet all inspection, test, and heat treatment requirements in § 178.337-16 of this subchapter in effect at the time of the repair, except that postweld heat treatment after minor weld repairs is not required. When a repair is made of defects revealed by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection, including those repaired by grinding, the affected area of the cargo tank must again be examined by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method after hydrostatic testing to assure that all defects have been removed.
