####### Thermocouples.

S6.11The brake temperature is measured by plug-type thermocouples installed in the approximate center of the facing length and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc pad, one per brake, as shown in figure 1. A second thermocouple may be installed at the beginning of the test sequence if the lining wear is expected to reach a point causing the first thermocouple to contact the metal rubbing surface of a drum or rotor. For centergrooved shoes or pads, thermocouples are installed within one-eighth of an inch to one-quarter inch of the groove and as close to the center as possible.
