######## e.g.

(vi) Applications and operations of the train automatic air brake, including emergency applications. The system shall record, or provide a means of determining, that a brake application or release resulted from manipulation of brake controls at the position normally occupied by the locomotive engineer. In the case of a brake application or release that is responsive to a command originating from or executed by an on-board computer (, electronic braking system controller, locomotive electronic control system, or train control computer), the system shall record, or provide a means of determining, the involvement of any such computer;

(vii) Applications and operations of the independent brake;

(viii) Applications and operations of the dynamic brake, if so equipped;

(ix) Cab signal aspect(s), if so equipped and in use;

(x) End-of-train (EOT) device loss of communication front to rear and rear to front;

(xi) Electronic controlled pneumatic braking (ECP) message (and loss of such message), if so equipped;

(xii) EOT armed, emergency brake command, emergency brake application;

(xiii) Indication of EOT valve failure;

(xiv) EOT brake pipe pressure (EOT and ECP devices);

(xv) EOT marker light on/off;

(xvi) EOT "low battery" status;

(xvii) Position of on/off switch for headlights on lead locomotive;

(xviii) Position of on/off switch for auxiliary lights on lead locomotive;

(xix) Horn control handle activation;

(xx) Locomotive number;

(xxi) Locomotive automatic brake valve cut in;

(xxii) Locomotive position in consist (lead or trail);

(xxiii) Tractive effort;

(xxiv) Cruise control on/off, if so equipped and in use; and

(xxv) Safety-critical train control data routed to the locomotive engineer's display with which the engineer is required to comply, specifically including text messages conveying mandatory directives and maximum authorized speed. The format, content, and proposed duration for retention of such data shall be specified in the Product Safety Plan or PTC Safety Plan submitted for the train control system under subparts H or I, respectively, of part 236 of this chapter, subject to FRA approval under this paragraph. If it can be calibrated against other data required by this part, such train control data may, at the election of the railroad, be retained in a separate certified crashworthy memory module.

(4) A DMU locomotive and an MU locomotive originally ordered on or after October 1, 2006 or placed in service on or after October 1, 2009, shall be equipped with an event recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of Appendix D of this part. The certified event recorder memory module shall be mounted for its maximum protection. (Although other mounting standards may meet this standard, an event recorder memory module mounted behind the collision posts and above the platform level is deemed to be mounted "for its maximum protection.") The event recorder shall record, and the certified crashworthy event recorder memory module shall retain, the following data elements:

(i) Train speed;

(ii) Selected direction of motion;

(iii) Time;

(iv) Distance;

(v) Throttle position;
