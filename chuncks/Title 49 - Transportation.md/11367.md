####### FRA silence.

(2)Anyone who does not receive a response within one year of the date they filed their petition, whether through administrative or postal error, must notify FRA that the response has not been received. The notification should be provided to FRA by some form of registered mail to ensure a record of delivery. Upon receipt of this notification, FRA will ensure that a response is either issued, or re-issued, as soon as possible. In the interim, however, any operator who is at the end of their inspection cycle under the rules in effect prior to January 18, 2000 (See 49 CFR parts 200-999, revised October 1, 1978) will be allowed to remain in service without conducting the required inspection under ยง 230.17 for an additional six months, or until they receive FRA's decision, whichever occurs first.
