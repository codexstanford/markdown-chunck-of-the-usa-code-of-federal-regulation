S12.9(a) Utilize a cylinder having a radius equal to the supported bend radius in Table VIII for the size of tubing being tested.

(b) Bend the tubing 180 degrees around the cylinder and hold in place with a clamp or other suitable support, applying only enough force on the tubing to hold it in position.

(c) Condition the tubing and cylinder in an air oven at 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius) for 72 hours. Remove the tubing and cylinder from the oven and cool at room temperature for two hours.

(d) Remove the clamps or supports from the tubing and straighten the tubing at a steady rate in a period of 4 to 8 seconds.
