######## Tests.

(iv)The generic type for a self-reactive material must be determined using the testing protocol from Figure 20.1 (a) and (b) (Flow Chart Scheme for Self-Reactive Substances and Organic Peroxides) from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter).

(3) Readily combustible solids are materials that-

(i) Are solids which may cause a fire through friction, such as matches;

(ii) Show a burning rate faster than 2.2 mm (0.087 inches) per second when tested in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter); or

(iii) Any metal powders that can be ignited and react over the whole length of a sample in 10 minutes or less, when tested in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria.

(4) Polymerizing materials are materials which, without stabilization, are liable to undergo an exothermic reaction resulting in the formation of larger molecules or resulting in the formation of polymers under conditions normally encountered in transport. Such materials are considered to be polymerizing substances of Division 4.1 when:

(i) Their self-accelerating polymerization temperature (SAPT) is 75 &#xB0;C (167 &#xB0;F) or less under the conditions (with or without chemical stabilization) as offered for transport in the packaging, IBC or portable tank in which the material or mixture is to be transported. An appropriate IBC or portable tank for a polymerizing material must be determined using the heating under confinement testing protocol from boxes 7, 8, 9, and 13 of Figure 20.1 (a) and (b) (Flow Chart Scheme for Self-Reactive Substances and Organic Peroxides) from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter) by successfully passing the UN Test Series E at the "None" or "Low" level, or by an equivalent test method with the approval of the Associate Administrator;

(ii) They exhibit a heat of reaction of more than 300 J/g; and

(iii) Do not meet the definition of hazard classes 1-8 (including combustible liquids).

(iv) The provisions concerning polymerizing substances in paragraph (a)(4) will be effective until January 2, 2023.
