####### Location of test points.

S14.2.1.4Test point location must comply with the following nomenclature:

(a) The line formed by the intersection of a vertical plane through the light source of the lamp and normal to the test screen is designated "V".

(b) The line formed by the intersection of a horizontal plane through the light source and normal to the test screen is designated "H".

(c) The point of intersection of these two lines is designated "H-V".

(d) Other test points on the test screen are measured in terms of angles from the H and V lines.

(e) Angles to the right (R) and to the left (L) are regarded as being to the right and left of the V line when the observer stands behind the lamp and looks in the direction of its light beam when it is properly aimed for photometry. Similarly, the upward angles designated as U and the downward angles designated as D, refer to light directed at angles above and below the H line, respectively.
