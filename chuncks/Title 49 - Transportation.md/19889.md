###### Factors for determining penalty amount.

(4)In determining the amount of any civil penalty proposed to be assessed or assessed under this section, NHTSA shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with applicable fuel consumption standards, the actual fuel consumption performance related to the applicable standards, the estimated cost to comply with the regulation and applicable standards, the quantity of vehicles or engines not complying, and the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business. The "estimated cost to comply with the regulation and applicable standards," will be used to ensure that penalties for non-compliance will not be less than the cost of compliance.
