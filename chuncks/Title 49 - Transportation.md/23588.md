####### Exemption applications-Specific content requirements.

S12.5Each application for a temporary exemption from the inflatable restraint requirement must include:

(a) A clear and specific identification of any component in the inflatable restraint system that has become unavailable due to circumstances beyond the manufacturer's control, and a diagram showing the location of such component within the restraint system and within the vehicle;

(b) A clear and specific explanation of the cause or causes of the disruption in the supply of the component, and a showing that such disruption is beyond the control of the manufacturer;

(c) An estimate of the length of time that will be needed to correct the disruption and again incorporate the subject components into current production, or an explanation of why it is not possible to provide such an estimate;

(d) A complete statement of the bases for the manufacturer's belief that NHTSA should grant a temporary exemption in response to this application;

(e) An unconditional statement by the manufacturer that it will recall every vehicle for which a temporary exemption is requested in the application, to install all missing inflatable restraint systems;

(f) A plan setting forth steps the manufacturer will take to ensure that as many exempted vehicles as possible will be returned for installation of missing inflatable restraint systems;

(g) A proposed reasonable period of time after the disruption in the supply of inflatable restraint system components is corrected that the manufacturer estimates will ensure a sufficient quantity of components for both anticipated production and retrofit of those vehicles for which a temporary exemption is requested in the application, so that the vehicle manufacturer can recall those vehicles for which a temporary exemption is requested and install inflatable restraint systems in them, together with a demonstration of why the manufacturer believes this proposed period of time is reasonable for completing this recall, or an explanation of why it is not possible to provide such an estimate;

(h) A proposed date for termination of the exemption;

(i) A proposed date by which all exempted vehicles will have been recalled and had inflatable restraints installed (assuming owners returned their vehicles in a timely matter in response to a first notice by the manufacturer), or an explanation of why it is not possible to provide such an estimate.
