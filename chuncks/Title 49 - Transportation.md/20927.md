####### Methyl alcohol resistance.

S12.14(a) Utilize a cylinder having a radius equal to the supported bend radius in Table VIII for the size of tubing being tested. The cylinder is constructed of a non-reactive material or coated to prevent chemical reaction with methyl alcohol.

(b) Bend the tubing 180 degrees around the cylinder and hold in place with a clamp or other suitable support constructed of non-reactive materials, applying only enough force on the tubing to hold it in position. The ends of the tubing may be shortened so that they will be fully submerged in the methyl alcohol.

(c) Immerse the tubing and cylinder in a 95 percent methyl alcohol aqueous solution at room temperature for 200 hours.

(d) Remove the tubing and cylinder from the solution. While still on the test cylinder, inspect the tubing under 7-power magnification for cracks.
