###### § 1313.4 Filing procedures and formats for contract summaries.
####### Format requirements for contract summary information.

(d)(1) The contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in §§ 1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, completed. When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term "Not Applicable" ("NA") shall be used.

(2) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and must be followed by the words "addition," "deletion," "extension," "cancellation," or other appropriate descriptive phrase in parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If "not applicable" is permitted in the original summary under §§ 1313.6 through 1313.8 of this part, the amended summary may use "not applicable" with a notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.

(3) Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as "not applicable" or "no change" where disclosure was required in the original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in the contract, whether amended or not.
