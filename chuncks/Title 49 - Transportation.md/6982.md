####### Solution over partial seams test.

(4)For other than design qualification testing, the following test may be used for metal drums: The packaging must be restrained while an internal air pressure of 48 kPa (7.0 psig) is applied; the method of restraint may not affect the results of the test. The packaging must be coated with a soap solution over the entire side seam and a distance of not less than eight inches on each side of the side seam along the chime seam(s). The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to pressurize the interior of the packaging to the specified air pressure and to determine if there is leakage of air from the packaging. A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of air from the packaging. Chime cuts must be made on the initial drum at the beginning of each production run and on the initial drum after any adjustment to the chime seamer. Chime cuts must be maintained on file in date order for not less than six months and be made available to a representative of the Department of Transportation on request.
