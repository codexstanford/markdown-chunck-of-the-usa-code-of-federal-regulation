######## Criteria for passing the test(s).

(e)(1) For metal IBCs, subjected to the 65 kPa (9.4 psig) test pressure specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, there may be no leakage or permanent deformation that would make the IBC unsafe for transportation.

(2) For metal IBCs intended to contain liquids, when subjected to the 200 kPa (29 psig) and the 250 kPa (36 psig) test pressures specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, there may be no leakage.

(3) For rigid plastic IBC types 21H1, 21H2, 31H1, and 31H2, and composite IBC types 21HZ1, 21HZ2, 31HZ1, and 31HZ2, there may be no leakage and no permanent deformation which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation.
