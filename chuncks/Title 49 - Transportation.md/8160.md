####### ยง 192.712 Analysis of predicted failure pressure.
######## Cracks and crack-like defects,Crack analysis models.

(d)-(1)When analyzing cracks and crack-like defects under this section, an operator must determine predicted failure pressure, failure stress pressure, and crack growth using a technically proven fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both), material properties (pipe and weld properties), and boundary condition used (pressure test, ILI, or other).
