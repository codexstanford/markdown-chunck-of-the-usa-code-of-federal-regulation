###### Short warp

(viii)(a): This segment contains a pair of profile deviations to produce a maximum permissible 10-foot warp perturbation. The first is on the outside rail, and the second follows 10 feet farther on the inside rail. Each deviation has a wavelength, Î», of 20 feet and variable amplitude for each simulation speed as described below. This segment is to be used only on curved track simulations.
