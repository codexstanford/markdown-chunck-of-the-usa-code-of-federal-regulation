######## Non-bulk packaging filling limits.

(b)(1) A non-bulk packaging not exceeding 400 kg may be filled with a liquid hazardous material only when the specific gravity of the material or gross mass of the package does not exceed that marked on the packaging, or a specific gravity of 1.2 if not marked, except as follows:

(i) A Packing Group I packaging may be used for a Packing Group II material with a specific gravity not exceeding the greater of 1.8, or 1.5 times the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, provided all the performance criteria can still be met with the higher specific gravity material;

(ii) A Packing Group I packaging may be used for a Packing Group III material with a specific gravity not exceeding the greater of 2.7, or 2.25 times the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, provided all the performance criteria can still be met with the higher specific gravity material; and

(iii) A Packing Group II packaging may be used for a Packing Group III material with a specific gravity not exceeding the greater of 1.8, or 1.5 times the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, provided all the performance criteria can still be met with the higher specific gravity material.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a non-bulk packaging may not be filled with a hazardous material to a gross mass greater than the maximum gross mass marked on the packaging.

(3) A non-bulk packaging not exceeding 400 kg which is tested and marked for liquid hazardous materials may be filled with a solid hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, or gross mass of the package, multiplied by the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked. In addition:

(i) A non-bulk packaging not exceeding 400 kg which is tested and marked for Packing Group I liquid hazardous materials may be filled with a solid Packing Group II hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, or gross mass of the package, multiplied by 1.5, multiplied by the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked.

(ii) A non-bulk packaging not exceeding 400 kg which is tested and marked for Packing Group I liquid hazardous materials may be filled with a solid Packing Group III hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, or gross mass of the package, multiplied by 2.25, multiplied by the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked.

(iii) A non-bulk packaging not exceeding 400 kg which is tested and marked for Packing Group II liquid hazardous materials may be filled with a solid Packing Group III hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, or gross mass of the package, multiplied by 1.5, multiplied by the specific gravity or gross mass of the package marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked.

(4) Packagings tested as prescribed in ยง 178.605 of this subchapter and marked with the hydrostatic test pressure as prescribed in ยง 178.503(a)(5) of this subchapter may be used for liquids only when the vapor pressure of the liquid conforms to one of the following:

(i) The vapor pressure must be such that the total pressure in the packaging (i.e., the vapor pressure of the liquid plus the partial pressure of air or other inert gases, less 100 kPa (15 psia)) at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F), determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and a filling temperature of 15 &#xB0;C (59 &#xB0;F)), will not exceed two-thirds of the marked test pressure;

(ii) The vapor pressure at 50 &#xB0;C (122 &#xB0;F) must be less than four-sevenths of the sum of the marked test pressure plus 100 kPa (15 psia); or

(iii) The vapor pressure at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F) must be less than two-thirds of the sum of the marked test pressure plus 100 kPa (15 psia).

(5) No hazardous material may remain on the outside of a package after filling.
