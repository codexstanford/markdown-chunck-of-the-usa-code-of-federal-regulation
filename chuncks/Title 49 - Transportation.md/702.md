##### ยง 23.25 What measures must recipients include in their ACDBE programs to ensure nondiscriminatory participation of ACDBEs in concessions?

(a) You must include in your ACDBE program a narrative description of the types of measures you intend to make to ensure nondiscriminatory participation of ACDBEs in concession and other covered activities.

(b) Your ACDBE program must provide for setting goals consistent with the requirements of Subpart D of this part.

(c) Your ACDBE program must provide for seeking ACDBE participation in all types of concession activities, rather than concentrating participation in one category or a few categories to the exclusion of others.

You must maximize the use of race-neutral measures, obtaining as much as possible of the ACDBE participation needed to meet overall goals through such measures.

The following are examples of race-neutral measures you can implement:

(1) Locating and identifying ACDBEs and other small businesses who may be interested in participating as concessionaires under this part;

(2) Notifying ACDBEs of concession opportunities and encouraging them to compete, when appropriate;

(3) When practical, structuring concession activities so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of ACDBEs

(4) Providing technical assistance to ACDBEs in overcoming limitations, such as inability to obtain bonding or financing;

(5) Ensuring that competitors for concession opportunities are informed during pre-solicitation meetings about how the recipient's ACDBE program will affect the procurement process;

(6) Providing information concerning the availability of ACDBE firms to competitors to assist them in obtaining ACDBE participation; and
