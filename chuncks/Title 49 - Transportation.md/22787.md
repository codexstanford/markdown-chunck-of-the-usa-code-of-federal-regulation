S6.5.3.1. The braking performance of a vehicle is determined by measuring the stopping distance from a given initial speed.

Where more than one stop is required for a given set of test conditions, a vehicle is deemed to comply with the corresponding stopping distance requirements if at least one of the stops is made within the prescribed distance.

S6.5.3.3. In the stopping distance formulas given for each applicable test (such as S&#x2264;0.10V + 0.0060V), S is the maximum stopping distance in meters, and V is the test speed in km/h.
