(c)A major market extension is a transaction which may significantly increase competition by extending service into a new market, expanding service in a currently served market when another carrier concurrently contracts its service to that market as part of the same transaction, or providing significantly more efficient and effective competitive service to a market presently being served. Criteria which can be used to determine if a railroad is proposing to provide a more competitive service to a currently served area include: (1) Creating a shorter route; (2) providing enhanced service capabilities (speed is not the only factor); (3) entering an interchange or market generating more than 5,000 cars per year or 5 percent of applicant's traffic; (4) filing the application as a condition of relief to a pending proceeding; and (5) permitting a carrier to become more competitive (extending its length of haul) See.354 I.C.C. 616, 617 (1978).
