###### System safety under normal operating conditions.

(1)The system (all its elements including hardware and software) must be designed to assure safe operation with no hazardous events under normal anticipated operating conditions with proper inputs and within the expected range of environmental conditions. All safety-critical functions must be performed properly under these normal conditions. The system shall operate safely even in the absence of prescribed operator actions or procedures. The designer must identify and categorize all hazards that may lead to unsafe system operation. Hazards categorized as unacceptable, which are determined by hazard analysis, must be eliminated by design. Best effort shall also be made by the designer to eliminate by design the hazards categorized as undesirable. Those undesirable hazards that cannot be eliminated should be mitigated to the acceptable level as required by this part.
