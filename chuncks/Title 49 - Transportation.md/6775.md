######## Pressure relief.

(2)The following pressure relief requirements apply to IBCs intended for liquids:

(i) IBCs must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor in the event of fire engulfment to ensure that no rupture of the body will occur due to pressure build-up. This can be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.

(ii) The start-to-discharge pressure may not be higher than 65 kPa (9 psig) and no lower than the vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus the partial pressure of the air or other inert gases, measured in the IBC at 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F), determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling as specified in ยง 173.35(d) of this subchapter. This does not apply to fusible devices unless such devices are the only source of pressure relief for the IBC. Pressure relief devices must be fitted in the vapor space.

(d) Metal IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).
