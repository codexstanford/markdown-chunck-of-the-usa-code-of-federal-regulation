######## Security.

(a)The installation commander (or designee) and officials of the on-base financial institutions shall work with the installation security authorities to establish an understanding as to each entity's responsibilities. The on-base financial institutions are encouraged to establish an ongoing relationship with installation security authorities on all matters of asset protection.

(1) A written agreement shall be established outlining the security procedures that the financial institution will follow and the role that installation security authorities will play with regard to alarms, movement of cash, and procedures to be followed in response to criminal activity (e.g., armed robbery).

(2) Cash and other assets in on-base banking offices and credit unions are the property of those financial institutions. Maintenance of alarms and use of armored cars is the sole responsibility of the on-base financial institution. The on-base financial institution is also solely responsible for the guarding or escorting of cash unless the installation commander determines that providing such services is desirable or necessary.
