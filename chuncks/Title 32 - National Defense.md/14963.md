(a) Claims for payment of actual and reasonable expenses for emergency medical care, including hospitalization, of ASWs who suffer illness or injury, and the transportation and burial of the remains of ASWs who suffer death as a direct result of such illness or injury will be paid in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Discharge by a physician or facility subsequent to such medical care or hospitalization shall terminate the period of emergency.

(2) That are incurred as a result of illness or injury that occurs while the ASW is acting in accord with orders of Selective Service to engage in travel or perform work for his Alternative Service employer.

(d) No claim shall be allowed in any case in which the Director determines that the injury, illness, or death occurred because of the negligence or misconduct of the ASW.

(e) No claim shall be paid unless it is presented to the Director within one year after the date on which the expense was incurred.
