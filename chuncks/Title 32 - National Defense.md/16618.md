###### Aggregating requests.

(f)OSTP may aggregate requests if it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a single requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, involve related matters and constitute a single request that otherwise would involve unusual circumstances. For example, OSTP may aggregate multiple requests for similar information filed by a single requester within a short period of time.
