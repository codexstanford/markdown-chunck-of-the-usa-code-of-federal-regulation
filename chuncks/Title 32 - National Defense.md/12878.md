######## Rates for civilian witnesses prescribed by law,Civilian witnesses not in Government employ.

(i)-(1)A civilian not in Government employ, who is compelled or required to testify as a witness before a Naval tribunal at a specified place or to appear at a place where his deposition is to be taken for use before a court or fact-finding body, will receive fees, subsistence, and mileage as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1821. Witness and subsistence fees are not prorated. Instead any fractional part of a calendar day expended in attendance or qualifying for subsistence entitles the witness to payment for a full day. Further, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing the payment of attendance fees to witnesses for:

(i) Attendance or travel which is not performed either as a direct result of being compelled to testify pursuant to a subpoena or as a direct result of invitational orders; or

(ii) For travel which is performed prior to being duly summoned as a witness; or

(iii) For travel returning to their places of residence if the travel from their places of residence does not qualify for payment under this paragraph.
