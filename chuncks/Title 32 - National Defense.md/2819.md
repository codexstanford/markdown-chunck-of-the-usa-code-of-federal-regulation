####### Q access authorization

means an access determination that is granted by DOE or NRC based on a Tier 5 or successor background investigation as set forth in applicable national-level requirements and DOE directives. Within DOE and the NRC, a "Q" access authorization permits an individual with an official "need to know" to access Top Secret, Secret and Confidential Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information, National Security Information, or special nuclear material in Category I or II quantities, as required in the performance of official duties. A "Q" access authorization is required for individuals with a need to know outside of DOE, NRC, DoD, and in a limited case NASA, to access Top Secret and Secret Restricted Data.
