######## Policy.

(2)Industrial facilities will be located on land owned by the Government or in which the Government has a permanent, disposable interest. Nonseverable industrial facilities will be located on land in which the Government has a disposable interest equal in term to the estimated useful life of the facilities, unless the Head of a Procuring Activity, with consideration to any nonrecoverable costs involved, determines that such location is not feasible. If the Head of a Procuring Activity makes this determination, he may authorize the location of such facilities on other land, provided:

(i) The estimated useful life of the facilities will not extend beyond the contract under which the facilities are installed or the completion of the work for which the facilities are provided; or

(ii) The contractor agrees to purchase the facilities upon the end of the facilities contract at the acquisition cost of the facilities, less depreciation; or

(iii) The Secretary approves other provisions as being in the interest of national defense.

(iv) If location on land in which the Government does not have a disposable interest, as above set out, is authorized under paragraphs (l)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the Government must have the right to abandon the facilities in place, with no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the facilities or the premises on which they are located.
