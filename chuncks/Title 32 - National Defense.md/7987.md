####### Facility of the Uniformed Services.

A facility of the Uniformed Services means any medical or dental treatment facility of the Uniformed Services (as that term is defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(43)). Contract facilities such as Navy NAVCARE clinics and Army and Air Force PRIMUS clinics that are funded by a facility of the Uniformed Services are considered to operate as an extension of the local military treatment facility and are included within the scope of this program. Facilities of the Uniformed Services also include several former Public Health Services facilities that are deemed to be facilities of the Uniformed Services pursuant to section 911 of Pub. L. 97-99 (often referred to as "Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities" or "USTFs").
