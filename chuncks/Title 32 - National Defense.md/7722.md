####### TAPP funding.

(a)Funding for this TAPP program will come from the Environmental Restoration Accounts established for Army, Navy, and Air Force for operational installations. The funding for Defense Agencies' operating installations will be from the Defense-Wide Environmental Restoration Account. Funding will be from the component's base closure account for transferring or closing installations. Funding for Formerly Used Defense Sites will come from the Environmental Restoration Account established for Formerly Used Defense Sites. After justification of the TAPP proposal, each DoD Component will make funds available from their individual installation's environmental restoration or BRAC accounts, considering a number of factors related to the restoration program at the installation and its impact upon the community. These factors include, but are not limited to:

(1) Closure status.

(2) Budget.

(3) Installation restoration program status.

(4) Presence (or absence) of alternate funding.

(5) Relative risk posed by sites at the installation.

(6) Type of task to be funded.

(7) Community concern.
