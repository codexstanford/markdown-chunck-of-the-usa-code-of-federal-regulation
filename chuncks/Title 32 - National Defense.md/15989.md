####### Overall marking.

(b)The highest level of classification is determined by the highest level of any one portion within the document and shall appear in a way that will distinguish it clearly from the informational text.

(1) Conspicuously place the overall classification at the top and bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), on the title page (if any), on the first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any).

(2) For documents containing information classified at more than one level, the overall marking shall be the highest level. For example, if a document contains some information marked "Secret" and other information marked "Confidential," the overall marking would be "Secret."

(3) Each interior page of a classified document shall be marked at the top and bottom either with the highest level of classification of information contained on that page, including the designation "Unclassified" when it is applicable, or with the highest overall classification of the document.
