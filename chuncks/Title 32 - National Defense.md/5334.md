###### ยง 199.4 Basic program benefits.
####### Billing practices.

(i)To be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, covered professional services must be performed personally by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider, who is other than a salaried or contractual staff member of a hospital or other authorized institution, and who ordinarily and customarily bills on a fee-for-service basis for professional services rendered. Such billings must be itemized fully and be sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the requirements regarding the special circumstances for teaching physicians. For continuing professional care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor, or directly by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on behalf of a beneficiary (refer to ยง 199.7).
