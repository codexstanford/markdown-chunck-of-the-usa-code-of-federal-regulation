####### Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs).

Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are a method of dividing hospital patients into clinically coherent groups based on the consumption of resources. Patients are assigned to the groups based on their principal diagnosis (the reason for admission, determined after study), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed, and the patient's age, sex, and discharge status.
