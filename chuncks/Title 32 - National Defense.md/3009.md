####### Transactions involving foreign persons, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

(j)

(1) The CFIUS is a USG interagency committee chaired by the Treasury Department that conducts assessments, reviews and investigations of transactions that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business, and certain non-controlling investments and certain real estate transactions involving foreign persons under 50 U.S.C. 4565.

(2) In CFIUS cases where the acquired U.S. business requires access to classified information, the CFIUS assessment, review or investigation, as applicable, and the CSA industrial security FOCI review are carried out in parallel, but are separate processes with different time constraints and considerations.

(3) The CSA will promptly advise the parties in a transaction under CFIUS review that would require FOCI negation or mitigation measures if consummated, to submit to the CSA a plan to negate or mitigate FOCI. If it appears that an agreement cannot be reached on material terms of a FOCI action plan, or if the U.S. person that is a party, or in applicable cases, a subject of the proposed transaction fails to comply with the FOCI reporting requirements of this rule, the CSA may recommend a full investigation of the transaction by the CFIUS to determine the effects on national security.
