###### Appendix A to Part 222 - Addressing MDR Requests
####### General.

(a)The Department of Defense does not have a central repository for DoD records. MDR requests therefore should be addressed to the DoD Component that has custody of the requested record. If a requester is not sure which DoD Component has custody or if the DoD Component is not listed below, the MDR request should be directed to the Washington Headquarters Services in paragraph (b)(1) of this appendix.
