###### ยง 725.8 Considerations in determining to grant or deny a request.
####### i.e.

(7) Whether disclosure, except when in camera (, before the judge alone) and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified under the DOD Information Security Program under DOD 5200.1-R, withholding of unclassified technical data from public disclosure following OPNAVINST 5510.161; privileged Naval Aviation Safety Program information (OPNAVINST 3750.6Q (NOTAL)), or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552, 552a;

(8) Whether disclosure would unduly interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings, violate constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or source of confidential information, conflict with U.S. obligations under international agreement, or be otherwise inappropriate under the circumstances;

(9) Whether attendance of the requested witness at deposition or trial will unduly interfere with the military mission of the command; and

(10) Whether, in a criminal case, requiring disclosure by a defendant of detailed information about the relevance of documents or testimony as a condition for release would conflict with the defendant's constitutional rights.
