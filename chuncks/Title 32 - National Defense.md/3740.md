####### Essential contractor service.

A service provided by a firm or an individual under contract to the DoD to support vital systems including ships owned, leased, or operated in support of military missions or roles at sea and associated support activities, including installation, garrison, base support, and linguist/translator services considered of utmost importance to the U.S. mobilization and wartime mission. The term also includes services provided to Foreign Military Sales customers under the Security Assistance Program. Services are considered essential because:

(1) The DoD Components may not have military or DoD civilian employees to perform the services immediately.

(2) The effectiveness of defense systems or operations may be seriously impaired and interruption is unacceptable when the services are not available immediately.
