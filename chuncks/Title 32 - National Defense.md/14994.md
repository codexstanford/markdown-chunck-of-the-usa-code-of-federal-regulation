(ii)(A) The Records Manager may require advance payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Records Manager may also require full payment in advance where a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.

(B) If the Records Manager estimates that the fees will likely exceed $25, he will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.
