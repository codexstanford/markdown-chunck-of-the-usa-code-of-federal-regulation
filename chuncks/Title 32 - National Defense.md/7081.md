####### Step 1: Calculate a median standardized cost for each procedure.

(i)For each ambulatory surgery procedure, a median standardized cost will be calculated on the basis of all ambulatory surgery charges nationally under CHAMPUS during a recent one-year base period. The steps in this calculation include standardizing for local labor costs by reference to the same wage index and labor/non-labor-related cost ratio as applies to the facility under Medicare, applying a cost-to-charge ratio, calculating a median cost for each procedure, and updating to the year for which the payment rates will be in effect by the Consumer Price Index-Urban. In applying a cost-to-charge ratio, the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio for freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (FASCs) will be used for all charges from FASCs, and the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio for hospital outpatient settings will be used for all charges from hospitals.
