For purposes of this definition an assembly and a component are the same. There are two types of "components: Major components and minor components. A major component includes any assembled element which forms a portion of an end item without which the end item is inoperable. For example, for an automobile, components will include the engine, transmission, and battery. If you do not have all those items, the automobile will not function, or function as effectively. A minor component includes any assembled element of a major component. Components" consist of parts. References in the CCL to components include both major components and minor components.
