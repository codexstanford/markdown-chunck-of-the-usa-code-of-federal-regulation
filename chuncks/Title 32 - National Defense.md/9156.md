######## Scope and relevancy.

(b)(1) In conjunction with DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3, the provisions of this part apply to service providers, whether they are working at a government facility or at a commercial site, and to contractors to the extent it is stipulated in the performance work statement of the contracts. DoD 4160.28-M and 10 U.S.C. 2576 contain additional specific guidance for property identified as MLI or CCL items.

(2) The procedures in this subpart will be used to the extent possible in all contingency operations. As appropriate, the ASD(L&MR) will modify policy guidance to support the mission requirements and operational tempo of contingency operations.

(3) This subpart does not govern the disposal of the property described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. However, once property in these categories has been altered to remove the inherently sensitive characteristics, it may be processed through a DLA Disposition Services site using an appropriate FSC code for the remaining components.
