###### ยง 2400.17 Policy.

Declassification of information shall be given emphasis comparable to that accorded classification. Information classified pursuant to Executive Order 12356 and prior orders shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information is reviewed for declassification pursuant to this regulation, that information shall be declassified unless the designated declassification authority determines that the information continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed in ยง 2400.9 of this part despite the passage of time. The Office of Science and Technology Policy officials shall coordinate their review of classified information with other agencies that have a direct interest in the subject matter.
