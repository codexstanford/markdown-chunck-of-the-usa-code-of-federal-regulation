(4)During contingency operations, in the event there is no communication with the DEERS database or the certificate authority, a temporary CAC may be issued with an abbreviated expiration date for a maximum of 10 days. The temporary card will not have PKI certificates and will be replaced as soon as the member can reach an online RAPIDS station or communications have been restored. Additionally, the temporary CAC does not communicate or imply eligibility to any DoD benefit. This capability will be enabled only at affected RAPIDS sites and must have approval granted by DMDC.
