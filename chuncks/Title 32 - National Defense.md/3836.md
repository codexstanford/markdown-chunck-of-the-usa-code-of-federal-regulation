####### Emergency Medical and Dental Care.

(i)All CAAF will normally be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting contingency operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U.S. forces will also normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition.
