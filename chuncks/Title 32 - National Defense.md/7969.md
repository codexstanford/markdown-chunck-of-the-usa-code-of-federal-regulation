###### ยง 220.10 Special rules for Medicare supplemental plans.
####### Inpatient hospital care charges.

(b)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 220.8, charges to Medicare supplemental plans for inpatient hospital care services provided to beneficiaries of such plans shall not, for any admission, exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible amount.

(2) Only one deductible charge shall be made per hospital admission (or Medicare benefit period), regardless of whether the admission is to a facility of the Uniformed Services or a Medicare certified civilian hospital. To ensure that a Medicare supplemental insurer is not charged the inpatient hospital deductible twice when an individual who is entitled to benefits under both DoD retiree benefits and Medicare, the following payment rules apply:

(i) If a dual beneficiary is first admitted to a Medicare-certified hospital and is later admitted to a facility of the Uniformed Services within the same benefit period initiated by the admission to the Medicare-certified hospital, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall not charge the Medicare supplemental insurance plan an inpatient hospital deductible.

(ii) If a dual beneficiary is admitted first to a facility of the Uniformed Services and secondly to a Medicare-certified hospital within 60 days of discharge from the facility of the Uniformed Services, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall refund to the Medicare supplemental insurer any inpatient hospital deductible that the insurer paid to the facility of the Uniformed Services so that it may pay the deductible to the Medicare-certified hospital.
