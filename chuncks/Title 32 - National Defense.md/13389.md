(b)Title 10 U.S.C. 2736 authorizes the Secretary of the Navy or designee to pay an amount not in excess of $100,000.00 in advance of the submission of a claim to or for any person, or the legal representative of any person, who was injured or killed, or whose property was damaged or lost, as the result of an accident for which allowance of a claim is authorized by law. Payment under this law is limited to that which would be payable under the MCA (10 U.S.C. 2733). Payment of an amount under this law is not an admission by the United States of liability for the accident concerned. Any amount so paid shall be deducted from any amount that may be allowed under any other provision of law to the person or his legal representative for injury, death, damage, or loss attributable to the accident concerned.
