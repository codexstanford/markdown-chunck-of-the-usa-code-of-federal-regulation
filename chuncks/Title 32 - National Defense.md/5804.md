Services may be excluded by reason of being not medically necessary (paragraph (g)(1) of this section), at an inappropriate level (paragraph (g)(3) of this section), custodial care (paragraph (g)(7) of this section) or other reason relative to reasonableness, necessity or appropriateness (which services shall throughout the remainder of this subsection, be referred to as "not medically necessary").
