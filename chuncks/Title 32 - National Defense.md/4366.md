The MRS will receive this rating when none of the three modules has a numerical (, 1 through 8) or an "evaluation pending" designation, and at least one of the modules is rated "no longer required."

(5) A rating of "no known or suspected hazard" is used to indicate that an MRS has no known or expected hazard. This designation is used only when the hazard evaluation modules are rated as "no known or suspected explosive hazard," "no known or suspected CWM hazard," and "no known or suspected MC hazard." (See appendix A, table 25.)
