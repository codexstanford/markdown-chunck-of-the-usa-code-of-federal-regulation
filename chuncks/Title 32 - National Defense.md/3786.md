####### OCS Planning.

(b)Combatant and subordinate JFCs determine whether contracted support capabilities are appropriate in support of a contingency. When contractor personnel and equipment are anticipated to support military operations, military planners will develop orchestrated, synchronized, detailed, and fully developed CSIPs and CMPs as components CONPLANs and OPLANs, in accordance with appropriate strategic planning guidance. CONPLANS without TPFDD and OPORDs shall contain CSIP- and CMP-like guidance to the extent necessary as determined by the CCDR. OCS planning will, at a minimum, consider HN support agreements, acquisition cross-servicing agreements, and Military logistics support agreements.
