####### Determinations regarding relative clinical and cost effectiveness for the selection of pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary,Clinical effectiveness.

(e)-(1)(i) It is presumed that pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class are clinically effective and should be included on the uniform formulary unless the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee finds by a majority vote that a pharmaceutical agent does not have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over the other pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary in that therapeutic class. This determination is based on the collective professional judgment of the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and consideration of pertinent information from a variety of sources determined by the Committee to be relevant and reliable. The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has discretion based on its collective professional judgment in determining what sources should be reviewed or relied upon in evaluating the clinical effectiveness of a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class.

(ii) Sources of information may include but are not limited to:

(A) Medical and pharmaceutical textbooks and reference books;

(B) Clinical literature;

(C) U.S. Food and Drug Administration determinations and information;

(D) Information from pharmaceutical companies;

(E) Clinical practice guidelines, and

(F) Expert opinion.

(iii) The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will evaluate the relative clinical effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents within a therapeutic class by considering information about their safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcome.

(iv) Information considered by the Committee may include but is not limited to:

(A) U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved and other studied indications;

(B) Pharmacology;

(C) Pharmacokinetics;

(D) Contraindications;

(J) Concomitant therapies;

(K) Results of safety and efficacy studies;

(L) Results of effectiveness/clinical outcomes studies, and

(M) Results of meta-analyses.

(2) Cost effectiveness. (i) In considering the relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class, the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee shall evaluate the costs of the agents in relation to the safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of the other agents in the class.

(ii) Information considered by the Committee concerning the relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents may include but is not limited to:

(A) Cost of the pharmaceutical agent to the Government;

(B) Impact on overall medical resource utilization and costs;

(C) Cost-efficacy studies;

(D) Cost-effectiveness studies;

(E) Cross-sectional or retrospective economic evaluations;

(F) Pharmacoeconomic models;

(G) Patent expiration dates;
