This form may be included in the record of trial with appropriate redactions. If a qualifying victim personally signs and initials a declination to receive the record of trial or to submit matters in clemency, this form may satisfy the requirement for a written waiver.Rules for Courts-Martial 1103(g)(3)(C) and 1105A(f)(3).
