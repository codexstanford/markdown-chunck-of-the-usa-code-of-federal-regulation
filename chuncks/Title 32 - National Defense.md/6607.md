####### Policy.

(c)The Director, TMA, or a designee, shall aggressively collect all debts arising out of its activities. Claims arising out of any incident, which has or probably will generate a claim in favor of the government, will not be compromised, except as otherwise provided in this section, nor will any person not authorized to take final action on the government's claim, compromise or terminate collection action. Title 28 U.S.C. 2415-2416 establishes a statute of limitation applicable to the government where previously neither limitations nor latches were available as a defense. Claims falling within the provisions of this statute will be referred to the Department of Justice without attempting administrative collection action, if such action cannot be accomplished in sufficient time to preclude the running of the statute of limitations.
