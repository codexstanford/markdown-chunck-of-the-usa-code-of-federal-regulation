##### ยง 1700.7 Processing of requests for records.
###### In general.

(a)Requests meeting the requirements of ยง 1700.3 through ยง 1700.6 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under the FOIA and this Part. A request will not be considered received until it reaches the IMO. Ordinarily upon its receipt a request will be date-stamped as received. It is this date that establishes when your request is received for administrative purposes, not any earlier date such as the date of the letter or its postmark date. For the quickest possible handling, both the request letter and the envelope should be marked "Freedom of Information Act Request."
