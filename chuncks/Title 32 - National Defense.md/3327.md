####### Protection of RD and FRD.

(10)Most of the protection requirements for RD and FRD are similar to NSI and are based on the classification level. However, there are some protection requirements for certain RD information that may be applied through specific contract requirements by the GCA. These range from distribution limitations through the limitation of access to specifically authorized individuals to specific storage requirements, including the requirement for IDSs, and additional accountability records.

(i) Any DOE contractor that violates a classified information security requirement may be subject to a civil penalty under the provisions of 10 CFR part 824.
