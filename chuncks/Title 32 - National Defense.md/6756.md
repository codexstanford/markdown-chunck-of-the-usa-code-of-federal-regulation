If the active duty member is later transferred to a duty station where dental care for the dependents is not available in the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may reenroll their eligible dependents in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one (1) year. This disenrollment provision does not apply to enrolled dependents of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve or to enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve.
