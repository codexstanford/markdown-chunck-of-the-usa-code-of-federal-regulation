####### Workers' compensation program or plan.

A workers' compensation program or plan is any program or plan that provides compensation for loss, to employees or their dependents, resulting from the injury, disablement, or death of an employee due to an employment related accident, casualty or disease. The common characteristic of such a plan or program is the provision of compensation regardless of fault, in accordance with a delineated schedule based upon loss or impairment of the worker's wage earning capacity, as well as indemnification or compensation for medical expenses relating to the employment related injury or disease. A workers' compensation program or plan includes any such program or plan:

(1) Operated by or under the authority of any law of any State (or the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands).

(2) Operated through an insurance arrangement or on a self-insured basis by an employer.

(3) Operated under the authority of the Federal Employees Compensation Act or the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
