####### Commissary Credit/Debit Card User Fee.

(a)(1) Only patrons of groups newly authorized privileges by this part must pay a user fee when using a credit or debit card to pay for commissary purchases to offset additional costs charged to the U.S. Treasury associated with credit or debit card use.

(2) The user fee will be set as a transaction-based flat rate, calculated within a range of the average annual rates of credit and debit card transaction costs incurred by the Department of Treasury on behalf of DeCA and in compliance with applicable card network rules. One rate will be set for credit and signature debit card transactions, which are processed as credit cards. Another rate will be set for personal identification number debit card transactions. These rates will be reviewed annually and adjustments may be made as necessary to meet the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 1065.
