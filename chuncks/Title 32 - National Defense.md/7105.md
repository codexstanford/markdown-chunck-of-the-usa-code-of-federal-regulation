###### ยง 199.14 Provider reimbursement methods.
####### Unrelated medical treatment.

(4)Any covered CHAMPUS services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition for which hospice care was elected will be paid in accordance with standard reimbursement methodologies; i.e., payment for these services will be subject to standard deductible and cost-sharing provisions under the CHAMPUS. A determination must be made whether or not services provided are related to the individual's terminal illness. Many illnesses may occur when an individual is terminally ill which are brought on by the underlying condition of the ill patient. For example, it is not unusual for a terminally ill patient to develop pneumonia or some other illness as a result of his or her weakened condition. Similarly, the setting of bones after fractures occur in a bone cancer patient would be treatment of a related condition. Thus, if the treatment or control of an upper respiratory tract infection is due to the weakened state of the terminal patient, it will be considered a related condition, and as such, will be included in the hospice daily rates.
