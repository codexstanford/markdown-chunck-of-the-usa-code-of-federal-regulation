(2) The SP must provide the Government with sufficient information to enable the Government to determine whether the SP is eligible to receive such information, and possesses the capability to provide appropriate protections for the GFI.

(3) Upon approval by the Government, the SP must enter into a legally binding agreement with the DIB participant (and also an appropriate agreement with the Government in any case in which the SP will receive or share information directly with the Government on behalf of the DIB participant) under which the SP is subject to all applicable requirements of this part and of any supplemental terms and conditions in the DIB participant's FA with the Government, and which authorizes the SP to use the GFI only as authorized by the Government.

(n) The DIB participant may not sell, lease, license, or otherwise incorporate the GFI into its products or services, except that this does not prohibit a DIB participant from being appropriately designated an SP in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section.
