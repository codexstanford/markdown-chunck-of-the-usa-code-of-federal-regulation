####### SF 709, CLASSIFIED Label:

(12)The SF 709 is used to identify and protect electronic media and other media that contain classified information pending a determination by the classifier of the specific classification level of the information. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a CLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 709 will be used. The SF 709 is affixed to the medium containing classified information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. When a classifier has made a determination of the specific level of classification of the information contained on the medium, either the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 shall be affixed on top of the SF 709 so that only the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 is visible. The national stock number of the SF 709 is 7540-01-207-5540.
