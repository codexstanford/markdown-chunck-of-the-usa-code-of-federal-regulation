####### Environmental Assessments.

9.The purpose of an environmental assessment is to assist DoD components in determining whether an environmental impact statement is required for a particular action. The assessment should be brief and concise but should include sufficient information on which a determination can be made whether the proposed action is major and Federal, and whether it significantly harms the environment of the global commons. As a minimum, the assessment should include consideration of the need for the proposed action and the environmental effect of the proposed action. The environmental assessment will be made available to the public in the United States upon request, but there is no requirement that it be distributed for public comment.
