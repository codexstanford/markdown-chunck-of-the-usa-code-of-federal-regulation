######## Letter from a school registrar.

A letter certifying enrollment in a full-time in-residence, or online course of study, leading to an associate degree or higher and listing an anticipated graduation date. Students attending two institutions less than full-time may not combine courses from both institutions to meet full-time student status. Most colleges and universities contract with third parties, such as the National Student Clearinghouse, to verify student enrollment. These third parties must comply with 20 U.S.C. 1232g and 34 CFR part 99 and are considered official agents of the institution for that purpose. Such documentation is considered equivalent to and accepted in lieu of a letter from the registrar's office. For graduate students, a letter of acceptance of enrollment signed by an authorized officer of the college or university is required to serve as the school letter.
