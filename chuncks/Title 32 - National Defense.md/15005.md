##### ยง 1665.2 Requests for access.
###### Access granted by mail.

(C)For records to be accessed by mail, the records manager shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification documentation will be required for the disclosure to the requester of information required to be made available to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552. When in the opinion of the records manager the granting of access through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar assurance of identity will be required.
