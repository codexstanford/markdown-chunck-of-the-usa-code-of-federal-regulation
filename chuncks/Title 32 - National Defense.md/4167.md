######## Documentation required to change a gender marker in DEERS.

(k)This paragraph (k) describes documentation required to request a change to a retiree's, a dependent's, or a contractor's gender marker in DEERS. Requests to change a gender marker require submission of documentation listed in Table 33 to this subpart that reflects the applicant's gender identity. All requests by retirees, dependents, and contractors to change gender markers must be submitted by the sponsor's responsible uniformed service project office or sponsoring agency to DoDHRA.

(1) For changes to a retiree's gender marker, after DoDHRA confirms the change in DEERS, the uniformed service project office must follow existing Service procedures to send an update to DFAS, or the Service equivalent pay office, to allow DFAS, or the Service equivalent pay office, to update its system with the retiree's gender identity.
