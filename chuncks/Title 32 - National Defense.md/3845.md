####### Post-Deployment Health Assessment.

(2)In accordance with DoD Instruction 6490.03, contracts shall require that CAAF complete a post-deployment health assessment in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) at the termination of the deployment (within 30 days of redeployment). These assessments will only be used by the DoD to accomplish population-wide assessments for epidemiological purposes, and to help identify trends related to health outcomes and possible exposures. They will not be used for individual purposes in diagnosing conditions or informing individuals they require a medical followup. Diagnosing conditions requiring medical referral is a function of the contractor.
