######## Scope of employment.

(d)"Scope of employment" is defined by the law of respondeat superior (master and servant) of the place where the act or omission occurred. Although 28 U.S.C. 2671 states that acting within the scope of employment means acting in the line of duty, the converse is not always true. For administrative purposes, a Government employee may be found "in the line of duty," yet not meet the criteria for a finding of "within the scope of employment" under the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
