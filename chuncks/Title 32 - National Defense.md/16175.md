####### SF 710, UNCLASSIFIED Label:

(13)In a mixed environment in which classified and unclassified information are being processed or stored, the SF 710 is used to identify electronic media and other media that contain unclassified information. Its function is to aid in distinguishing among those media that contain either classified or unclassified information in a mixed environment. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that an UNCLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 710 will be used. The SF 710 is affixed to the medium containing unclassified information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed. However, the label is small enough so that it can be wholly covered by a SF 706, SF 707, SF 708, or SF 709 if the medium subsequently contains classified information. The national stock number of the SF 710 is 7540-01-207-5539.
