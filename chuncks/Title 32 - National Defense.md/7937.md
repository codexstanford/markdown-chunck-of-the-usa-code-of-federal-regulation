###### ยง 220.4 Reasonable terms and conditions of health plan permissible.
####### General rules.

(b)(1) Based on the statutory requirement, after any impermissible exclusions have been made inoperative (see ยง 220.3 of this part), reasonable terms and conditions of the third party payer's plan that apply generally and uniformly to services provided in facilities other than facilities of the uniformed services may also be applied to services provided in facilities of the uniformed services.

(2) Except as provided by 10 U.S.C. 1095, this part, or other applicable law, third party payers are not required to treat claims arising from services provided in or through facilities of the Uniformed Services more favorably than they treat claims arising from services provided in other facilities or by other health care providers.
