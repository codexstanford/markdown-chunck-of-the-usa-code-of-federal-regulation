(l)The Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program, as authorized by section 1096, chapter 55, title 10, provides for the sharing of staff, equipment, and resources between the civilian and military health care system in order to achieve more effective, efficient, or economical health care for authorized beneficiaries. Military treatment facility commanders, based upon the authority provided by their respective Surgeons General of the military departments, are responsible for entering into individual partnership agreements only when they have determined specifically that use of the Partnership Program is more economical overall to the Government than referring the need for health care services to the civilian community under the normal operation of the CHAMPUS Program.
