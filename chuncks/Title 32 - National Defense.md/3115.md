(5)(i) When USG employees or employees of one contractor are temporarily stationed at another contractor's facility, the security procedures of the host contractor will govern.

(ii) USG personnel assigned to or visiting a contractor facility and engaged in oversight of an acquisition program will retain control of their work product. Classified work products of USG employees will be handled in accordance with this rule. Contractor procedures will not require USG employees to relinquish control of their work products, whether classified or not, to a contractor.

(iii) Contractor employees at USG installations will follow the security requirements of the host. This does not relieve the contractor from security oversight of their employees who are long-term visitors at USG installations.
