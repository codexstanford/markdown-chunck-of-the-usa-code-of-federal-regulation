####### General temporary military contingency payment adjustment for SCHs and CAHs.

(8)(i) Payments under paragraph (a) of this section for inpatient services provided by SCHs and CAHs may be supplemented by a GTMCPA. This is a year-end discretionary, temporary adjustment that the TMA Director may approve based on all the following criteria:

(A) The hospital serves a disproportionate share of ADSMs and ADDs;

(B) The hospital is a TRICARE network hospital;

(C) The hospital's actual costs for inpatient services exceed TRICARE payments or other extraordinary economic circumstance exists; and,

(D) Without the GTMCPA, DoD's ability to meet military contingency mission requirements will be significantly compromised.

(ii) Policy and procedural instructions implementing the GTMCPA will be issued as deemed appropriate by the Director, TMA, or a designee. As with other discretionary authority under this Part, a decision to allow or deny a GTMCPA to a hospital is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of ยง 199.10.
