####### Effecting compliance.

(n)(1) When a compliance review or complaint investigation indicates that a recipient has violated this part, the applicable DoD Component's supplementary guidelines, or the assurances executed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the responsible DoD Component or the ASD(MRA&L), or designee, shall attempt to effect compliance in accordance with paragraphs (o) and (p) of this section. The inability of a DoD Component to comply with any time frame prescribed by this part does not relieve a recipient of the responsibility for compliance with this part.

(2) The DoD Component may require, when necessary to overcome the effects of discrimination in violation of this part, a recipient to take remedial action:

(i) With respect to handicapped persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's program or activity but who were participants in the program or activity when such discrimination occurred.

(ii) With respect to handicapped persons who would have been participants in the recipient's program or activity had the discrimination not occurred.

(iii) With respect to handicapped persons presently in the recipient's program or activity, but not receiving full benefits or equal and integrated treatment within the program or activity.
