##### PART 232 - LIMITATIONS ON TERMS OF CONSUMER CREDIT EXTENDED TO SERVICE MEMBERS AND DEPENDENTS
###### ยง 232.4 Terms of consumer credit extended to covered borrowers.
####### Standards relating to bona fide fees,Like-kind fees.,e.g.,

(3)-(i)To assess whether a bona fide fee is reasonable under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the fee must be compared to fees typically imposed by other creditors for the same or a substantially similar product or service. For example, when assessing a bona fide cash advance fee, that fee must be compared to fees charged by other creditors for transactions in which consumers receive extensions of credit in the form of cash or its equivalent. Conversely, when assessing a foreign transaction fee, that fee may not be compared to a cash advance fee because the foreign transaction fee involves the service of exchanging the consumer's currency (a reserve currency) for the local currency demanded by a merchant for a good or service, and does not involve the provision of cash to the consumer.
