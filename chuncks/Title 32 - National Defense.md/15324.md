(b)Records will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate whenever NACIC determines:

(i) Whether the subject of the request concerns the operations or activities of the United States Government; and, if so,

(ii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute to an understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,

(iii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents will contribute to public understanding of United States Government operations or activities; and, if so,

(iv) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of United States Government operations and activities; and

(v) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,

(vi) Whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
