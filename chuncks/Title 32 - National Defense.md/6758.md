If, during any one (1) year enrollment period, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member disenrolls their dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve disenrolls themselves, for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments, dependents enrolled under the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or enrolled members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve, will be subject to a lock-out period of twelve (12) months. Following this period of time, active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members will be able to reenroll their eligible dependents, or members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve will be able to reenroll themselves, if they so choose. The twelve (12) month lock-out period applies to enrolled dependents of a Reserve component member who disenrolls for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments after the member has enrolled pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
