####### Special retrospective payment provision for new hospitals.

(C)For purposes of this paragraph, a new hospital is a hospital that qualifies for the Medicare exemption from the rate of increase ceiling applicable to new hospitals which are PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals. Any new hospital that becomes a higher volume hospital, in addition to qualifying prospectively as a higher volume hospital for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section, may additionally, upon application to the Director, OCHAMPUS, receive a retrospective adjustment. The retrospective adjustment shall be calculated so that the hospital receives the same government share payments it would have received had it been designated a higher volume hospital for the federal fiscal year in which it first had 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges and the preceding fiscal year (if it had any CHAMPUS patients during the preceding fiscal year). Such new hospitals must agree not to bill CHAMPUS beneficiaries for any additional costs beyond that determined initially.
