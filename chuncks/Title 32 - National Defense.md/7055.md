() An additional temporary military contingency payment adjustment (TMCPA) will also be available at the discretion of the Director, Defense Health Agency (DHA), or a designee, at any time after implementation to adopt, modify and/or extend temporary adjustments to OPPS payments for TRICARE network hospitals deemed essential for military readiness and deployment in time of contingency operations. Any TMCPAs to OPPS payments shall be made only on the basis of a determination that it is impracticable to support military readiness or contingency operations by making OPPS payments in accordance with the same reimbursement rules implemented by Medicare. The criteria for adopting, modifying, and/or extending deviations and/or adjustments to OPPS payments shall be issued through TRICARE policies, instructions, procedures and guidelines as deemed appropriate by the Director, DHA, or a designee. TMCPAs may also be extended to non-network hospitals on a case-by-case basis for specific procedures where it is determined that the procedures cannot be obtained timely enough from a network hospital. For such case-by-case extensions, "Temporary" might be less than three years at the discretion of the DHA Director, or designee.
