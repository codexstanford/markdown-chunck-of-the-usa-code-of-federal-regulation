####### Property returns.

(5)When property is returned by civilian rifle clubs or institutions, the DCM will prepare seven copies of the DD Form 1348-1. Five copies will be mailed to the rifle club or institution; one will be kept in suspense in the club's or institution's jacket file; and one will be sent to the US Army Management Systems Support Agency (USAMSSA), Wash., DC 20310, to update the "rifles intransit program." The rifle club or institution will enter on the five copies the shipment date, how shipped, the quantity shipped, and other necessary data not entered by the DCM and distribute the five copies as follows:

(i) Two copies to the consignee (receiving depot, arsenal, or installation). One copy of the DD Form 1348-1 received by the consignee will be used to tally the shipment and to account for property received. The other copy will be signed by the accountable property officer (or representative) and will be sent to the DCM to terminate the open receipt in the loan voucher file.

(ii) One copy with the shipment.

(iii) One copy to the DCM, HQDA (SFDM), accompanied by the bill of lading (where available).

(iv) One copy retained by the rifle club or institution.
