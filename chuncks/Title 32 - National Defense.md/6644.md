(g)-(1)Federal claims against the debtor and in favor of the United States arising out of the administration of TRICARE may be compromised or collection action taken thereon may be suspended or terminated in compliance with the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711, as implemented by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900-904. The provisions concerning compromise, suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 apply to debts, which do not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the DOJ.
