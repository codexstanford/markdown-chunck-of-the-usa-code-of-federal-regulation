###### ยง 705.14 Embarkation of media representatives.
####### Arrangements aboard ship.

(c)(1) Where appropriate, a briefing should be held at the earliest convenient time after embarkation at which newsmen may meet the commanding officer and other key personnel and guests and at which previously supplied information is reviewed.

(2) If feasible, an escort officer will be assigned to each newsman (or group of newsmen having similar requirements).

(3) It should be reported in the ship's newspaper (and on radio and closed-circuit TV, if any) that newsmen will be embarked, giving their names and the media they represent.

(4) If a correspondent is interested in home town material, personnel from his area should be contacted in advance, if possible, to determine if and when they would be available for interviews and photos.

(5) Representatives of press associations and radio and TV networks will be embarked in the Exercise Commander's flagship or the Exercise Control ship, when possible. This ship should also control the ship-to-shore press radio and teletype (RATT).

(6) When more than one representative from the same medium is embarked, an attempt should be made to have them located at separate vantage points.
