A cost avoidance or savings measure to recover useful (serviceable) end items, repair parts, components, or assemblies from one or more principal end items of equipment or assemblies (usually supply condition codes (SCCs) listed in DLM 4000.25-2 as SCC H for unserviceable (condemned) materiel, SCC P for unserviceable (reclamation) materiel, and SCC R for suspended (reclaimed items, awaiting condition determination) materiel) for the purpose of restoration to use through replacement or repair of one or more unserviceable, but repairable principal end items of equipment or assemblies (usually SCCs listed in DLM 4000.25-2 as SCC E for unserviceable (limited restoration) materiel, SCC F for unserviceable (reparable) materiel, and SCC G for unserviceable (incomplete) materiel). Reclamation is preferable prior to disposition (DLA Disposition Services site turn-in), but end items or assemblies may be withdrawn from DLA Disposition Services sites for such reclamation purposes.
