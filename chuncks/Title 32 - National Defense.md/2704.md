(4) The release of classified information by the USG to contractors, who are required to safeguard classified information released during all phases of the contracting, agreement (including cooperative research and development agreements), licensing, and grant processes,the preparation and submission of bids and proposals, negotiation, award, performance, and termination. Also, it applies in situations involving a contract, agreement, license, or grant when actual knowledge of classified information is not required, but reasonable physical security measures cannot be employed to prevent aural or visual access to classified information, because there is the ability and opportunity to gain knowledge of classified information. It also applies to any other situation in which classified information or FGI that is furnished to a contractor requires protection in the interest of national security, but which is not released under a contract, license, certificate or grant.

(b) This rule does not:

(1) Limit in any manner the authority of USG executive branch departments and agencies to grant access to classified information under the cognizance of their department or agency to any individual designated by them. The granting of such access is outside the scope of the NISP and is accomplished pursuant to E.O. 12968, E.O. 13526, E.O. 13691, the AEA, and applicable disclosure policies.

(2) Apply to criminal proceedings in the courts or authorize contractors or their employees to disclose classified information in connection with any criminal proceedings. Defendants and their representative in criminal proceedings in U.S. District Courts, Courts of Appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court may gain access to classified information in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Appendix 3, Section 1, also known as and referred to in this rule as the "Classified Information Procedures Act," as amended.
