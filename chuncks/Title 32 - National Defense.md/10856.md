######## Exemption.

(i)During the course of processing a General Counsel action, exempt materials from other systems of records may in turn become part of the case records in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those `other' systems of records are entered into the Public Affairs Files, the Office of the Inspector General hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those `other' systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary systems of records which they are a part.
