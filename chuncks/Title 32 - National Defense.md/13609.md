######## General.

(a)(1) Entry authorizations may be issued only after an Entry Control Commander, or a duly authorized subordinate acting in his behalf, has determined that the presence of the person, ship, or aircraft will not, under existing or reasonably foreseeable future conditions, endanger, place an undue burden upon, or otherwise jeopardize the efficiency, capability, or effectiveness of any military installation located within or contiguous to a defense area. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to, the true purpose of the entry, the personal history, character and present or past associates of the individuals involved, the possible burdens or threats to the defense facilities which the presence of the ship, aircraft or the individual or individuals involved impose or might reasonably be expected to impose on the related base complex.

(2) Requests for entry authorizations will be evaluated and adjudged as to whether the entry at the time and for the purpose stated will or will not be inimical to the purposes of national defense.
