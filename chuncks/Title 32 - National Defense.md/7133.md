####### Appropriate charge level.

(iii)Beginning in calendar year 1992, the appropriate charge level shall be calculated on a national basis. The appropriate charge level for each procedure is the product of the two-step process set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. This process involves comparing the prior year's CMAC with the fully phased in Medicare fee. For years after the Medicare fee has been fully phased in, the comparison shall be to the current year Medicare fee. For any particular procedure for which comparable Medicare fee and CHAMPUS data are unavailable, but for which alternative data are available that the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) determines provide a reasonable approximation of relative value or price, the comparison may be based on such alternative data.
