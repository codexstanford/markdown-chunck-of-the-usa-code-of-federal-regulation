######## Supply condition codes (SCC).

Code used to classify materiel in terms of readiness for issue and use or to identify action underway to change the status of materiel. These codes are assigned by the Military Departments or Defense Agencies. DLA Disposition Services may change a SCC if there is an appearance of an improperly assigned code and the property is of a non-technical nature. If change is not appropriate or property is of a technical nature, DLA Disposition Services sites may challenge a suspicious SCC.
