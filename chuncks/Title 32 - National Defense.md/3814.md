(9)When necessary and directed by CCDR, the contracting officer will include language in the contract authorizing CAAF and selected non-CAAF, as designated by the CCDR, to be issued military IPE (CBRN protective ensemble, body armor, ballistic helmet) in accordance with DoD Directive 1100.4. This equipment shall typically be issued at the deployment center, before deployment to the designated operational area, and must be accounted for and returned to the Government or otherwise accounted for in accordance with appropriate DoD Component standing regulations (including DoD Instruction 4161.2 (see), directives, instructions, and supplementing publications). It is important to plan and resource IPE as required by the geographic CCDR or subordinate JFC, and the terms of the contract. Training on the proper care, fitting, and maintenance of issued protective equipment will be provided as part of contractor deployment training. This training will include practical exercises within the context of the various mission-oriented protective posture levels. When a contractor is required under the terms and conditions of the contract to provide IPE, such IPE shall meet minimum standards as defined by the contract.
