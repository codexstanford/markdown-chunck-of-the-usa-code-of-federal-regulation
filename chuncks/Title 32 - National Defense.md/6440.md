####### Dual Compensation.

(e)(1) Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits active duty members of the Uniformed Services or employees (including part-time or intermittent) appointed in the civil service of the United States Government from receiving additional compensation from the Government above their normal pay and allowances. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS payments for care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government.

(2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing of a claim shall be denied where the services or supplies were provided by an active duty member of the Uniformed Services or a civilian employee of the Government. This denial of CHAMPUS payment applies whether the claim for reimbursement is filed by the individual who provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or by the beneficiary.

(3) The prohibition against dual compensation does not apply to individuals under contract to the Uniformed Services or the Government.
