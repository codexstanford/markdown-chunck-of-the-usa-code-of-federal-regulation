(v)Patient movement of CAAF shall be performed in accordance with DoD Instruction 6000.11 (see). When CAAF are evacuated for medical reasons from the designated operational area to MTFs funded by the Defense Health Program, normal reimbursement policies will apply for services rendered by the facility. Should CAAF require medical evacuation outside the continental United States (OCONUS), the sending MTF shall assist CAAF in making arrangements for transfer to a civilian facility of their choice. When U.S. forces provide emergency medical care to non-CAAF, these patients will be evacuated or transported via national means (when possible) to their local medical systems.
