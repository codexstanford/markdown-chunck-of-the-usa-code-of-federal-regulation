######## Contents of the application.

(c)All applications shall contain:

(1) Full name of the applicant;

(2) Social Security Number, service number (if different), and branch of service of the applicant;

(3) Present age and date of birth of the applicant;

(4) Present residence of the applicant;

(5) Date and place of the trial, and type of court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;

(6) Command title of the convening authority of the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;

(7) Offense(s) of which the applicant was convicted, and sentence finally approved from the trial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;

(8) Date the punitive discharge or dismissal was executed;

(9) Applicant's present marital status, and number and ages of dependents, if any;

(10) Applicant's civilian criminal record (arrest(s) with disposition, and conviction(s)), both prior and subsequent to the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal;

(11) Applicant's entire court-martial record (offense(s) of which convicted and finally approved sentence(s)), and nonjudicial punishment record (including offense(s) and punishment(s) awarded);

(12) Any military administrative discharge proceedings (circumstances and disposition) initiated against the applicant;

(13) Applicant's full employment record since the punitive discharge or dismissal was executed;

(14) The specific type and character of administrative discharge requested pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 874(b) (a more favorable administrative discharge than that requested will not be approved);

(15) At least three but not more than six character affidavits, (The character affidavits must be notarized, must indicate the relationship of the affiant to the applicant, and must include the address of the affiant as well as specific reasons why the affiant believes the applicant to be of good character. The affidavits should discuss the applicant's character primarily as reflected in the civilian community subsequent to the punitive discharge or dismissal which is the subject of the application);

(16) Any matters, other than the character affidavits, supporting the considerations described in subparagraph (18) below;

(17) Any other relief sought within the Department of the Navy and outside the Department of the Navy including dates of application and final dispositions;

(18) A statement by the applicant, setting forth the specific considerations which the applicant believes constitute "good cause," so as to warrant the substitution of an administrative form of discharge for the punitive discharge or dismissal previously executed. (In this connection, 10 U.S.C. 874(b) does not provide another regular or extraordinary procedure for the review of a court-martial. Questions of guilt or innocence, or legal issues attendant to the court-martial which resulted in the punitive discharge or dismissal, are neither relevant nor appropriate for consideration under 10 U.S.C. 874(b). As used in the statute, "good cause" was envisioned by Congress to encompass only Secretarial exercise of clemency and ultimate control of sentence uniformity. Accordingly, in determining what constitutes "good cause" under 10 U.S.C. 874(b), the primary Secretarial concern will be with the applicant's record in the civilian community subsequent to his or her punitive separation. Material submitted by the 10 U.S.C. 874(b) applicant should be consistent with the foregoing.)
