###### Waiver or reduction of fees,Standards for determining waiver or reduction.

(4)-(i)The Records Manager shall grant a waiver or reduction of fees chargeable under this section where it is determined that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Selective Service System and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The Records Manager shall also waive fees that are less than the average cost of collecting fees. In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest, the following factors may be considered:

(A) The relation of the records to the operations or activities of the System;

(B) The information value of the information to be disclosed;

(C) Any contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure;

(D) The significance of that contribution to the public understanding of the subject;

(E) The nature of the requester's personal interest, if any, in the disclosure requested; and

(F) Whether the disclosure would be primarily in the requester's commercial interest.

(ii) Contents of request for waiver. The Records Manager will normally deny a request for a waiver of fees that does not include:

(A) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the requested documents;

(B) The use proposed for the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;

(C) A statement of how the public will benefit from such use and from the release of the requested documents; and

(D) If specialized use of the documents or information is contemplated, a statement of the requester's qualifications that are relevant to the specialized use.
