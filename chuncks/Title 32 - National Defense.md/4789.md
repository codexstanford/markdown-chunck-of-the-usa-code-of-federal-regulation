####### Program funds.

(e)The funds used by CHAMPUS are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for the Department of Defense and the DHHS. These funds are further disbursed by agents of the government under contracts negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These agents (referred to in this part as CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries) receive claims against CHAMPUS and adjudicate the claims under this part and in accordance with administrative procedures and instructions prescribed in their contracts. The funds expended for CHAMPUS benefits are federal funds provided CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries solely to pay CHAMPUS claims, and are not a part of or obtained from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary's funds related to other programs or insurance coverage. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are reimbursed for the adjudication and payment of CHAMPUS claims at a rate (generally fixed-price) prescribed in their contracts.
