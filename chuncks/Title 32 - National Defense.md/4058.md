######## CAC Personal ID Number (PIN) Reset.

(5)DoD has manned workstations capable of resetting the PINs of a CAC holder with a locked card or forgotten PIN. These workstations are intended to provide alternative locations for CAC holders to service their cards other than RAPIDS issuance locations. To authenticate cardholders, live biometric samples shall be checked against the biometrics stored in DEERS prior to resetting CACs. This process requires the presence of a CPR trusted agent (CTA) or TASM or RAPIDS VO or SSM.
