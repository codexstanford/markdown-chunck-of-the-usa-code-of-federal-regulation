(ii) When making logistics sustainability recommendations, the DoD Components and acquisition managers shall consider the requirements of DoD Instruction 5000.02 (see) and paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Early in the contingency or crisis action planning process, they shall coordinate with the affected supported and supporting commands any anticipated requirements for contractor logistics support arrangements that may affect existing CONPLANs, OPLANs, and OPORDs. As part of the supporting plans, supporting organizations (Service components, defense agencies, others) must provide adequate data (estimates of the numbers of contractors and contracts and the types of supplies or services that will be required to support their responsibilities within the OPLAN) to the supported command planners to ensure the supported commander has full knowledge of the magnitude of contracted support required for the applicable contingency operation.
