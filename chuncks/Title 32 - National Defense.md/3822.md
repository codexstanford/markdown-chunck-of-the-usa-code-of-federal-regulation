####### Reception.

(1)All CAAF shall be processed into the operational area through a designated reception site. The site shall verify, based upon a visual inspection of the LOA, that contractor personnel are entered into SPOT or its successor, and verify that personnel meet theater-specific entry requirements. Contractor personnel already in the designated operational area when a contingency is declared must report to the appropriate designated reception site as soon as it is operational. If any CAAF does not have the proper documentation, the person will be refused entry into the theater, and the contracting officer will notify the contractor to take action to resolve the reason for the lack of proper documentation for performing in that area. Should the contractor fail to take that action, the person shall be sent back to his or her departure point, or directed to the Service component command or Defense Agency responsible for that specific contract for theater entrance processing.
