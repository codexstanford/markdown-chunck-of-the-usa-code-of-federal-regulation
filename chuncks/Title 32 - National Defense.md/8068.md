(c)Members of the public seeking the declassification of DoD documents under the provisions of section 3.5 of Executive Order 13526, and 50 U.S.C. 431, 432, 432a, 432b, and 432d shall:

(1) Address the written request to the appropriate DoD Component listed in the appendix to this enclosure.

(2) Identify the requested document or information with sufficient specificity to enable the DoD Component to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Information that would provide the sufficient specificity would include a document identifier such as originator, date, title, subject, the National Archives and Records Administration accession number, or other applicable unique document identifying number. Broad or topical MDR requests for records on a particular subject, such as "any and all documents concerning" a subject do not meet this standard.

(3) Include a correct return mailing address with the request.

(4) Include a statement that the requester understands that the request may incur processing charges in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.
