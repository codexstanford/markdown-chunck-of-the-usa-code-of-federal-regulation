###### Subpart B - DoD Identification (ID) Cards: ID Card Life-Cycle
####### ยง 161.8 ID card life-cycle roles and responsibilities.
######## Separation of duties.

(b)The ID card life-cycle includes a requirement for a separation of duties to support the issuance process. This rule requires more than one person to serve in an official role during the sponsorship and enrollment and issuance processes. Authorizing a RAPIDS SSM or VO to exercise the duties of a TASS TASM, TA, or sponsor would allow a single individual to control the ID card issuance process, from record creation to card issuance. Individuals serving in the role of a RAPIDS SSM or VO shall not exercise the role of the TASS TASM or TA or the role of the signatory sponsor on the DD Form 1172-2. (In the case of their own dependents, a RAPIDS SSM or VO can serve as the sponsor on the DD Form 1172-2 but cannot serve as the VO for card issuance.)
