######## Risk management.

The process of identifying risk factors associated with increased risk for child abuse or domestic abuse, and controlling those factors that can be controlled through collaborative partnerships with key military personnel and civilian agencies, including the active duty member's commander, law enforcement personnel, child protective services, and victim advocates. It includes the development and implementation of an intervention plan when significant risk of lethality or serious injury is present to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and to increase the victim's safety, continuous assessment of risk factors associated with the abuse, and prompt updating of the victim's safety plan, as needed.
