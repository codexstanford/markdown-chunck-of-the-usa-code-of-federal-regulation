######## Entry level separation.,http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133214p.pdf

As defined in DoD Instruction 1332.14, "Enlisted Administrative Separations" (available at), an enlisted service member is considered in an entry-level status during the first 180 days of continuous active military service, or the first 180 days of continuous active service after a service break of more than 92 days of active service. A Service member of a Reserve Component who is not on active duty or who is serving under a call or order to active duty for 180 days or less begins entry-level status upon enlistment in a Reserve Component. Entry-level status for such a Service member of a Reserve Component terminates as follows:

(1) 180 days after beginning training if the Service member is ordered to active duty for training for one continuous period of 180 days or more; or

(2) 90 days after the beginning of the second period of active duty training if the Service member is ordered to active duty for training under a program that splits the training into two or more separate periods of active duty. For the purposes of characterization of service or description of separation, the Service member's status is determined by the date of notification as to the initiation of separation proceedings.
