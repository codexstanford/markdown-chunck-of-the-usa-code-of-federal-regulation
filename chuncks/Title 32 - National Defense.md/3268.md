Additionally, each paragraph or portion containing the NATO information will be marked with the appropriate NATO classification, abbreviated in parentheses ("NS" for NATO SECRET) preceding the portion or paragraph. Declassification and downgrading instructions shall indicate that the NATO information is exempt from declassification or downgrading without the prior consent of NATO, in the absence of other originator instructions, citing the reason "Foreign Government Information."
