####### Total Funding
######## ยง 37.520 What is my responsibility for determining that the total project funding is reasonable?
######### Real property and equipment.

(b)In almost all cases, the project costs may include only depreciation or use charges for real property and equipment of for-profit participants, in accordance with ยง 37.685. Remember that the budget for an expenditure-based TIA may not include depreciation of a participant's property as a direct cost of the project if that participant's practice is to charge the depreciation of that type of property as an indirect cost, as many organizations do.
