####### ยง 842.27 Reconsideration of a claim.

A claimant may request reconsideration of an initial settlement or denial of a claim. The claimant sends the request in writing, to the settlement authority within a reasonable time following the initial settlement or denial. Sixty days is considered a reasonable time, but the settlement authority may waive the time limit for good cause.

(a) The original settlement authority reviews the reconsideration request. The settlement authority sends the entire claim file with recommendations and supporting rationale to the next higher settlement authority if all relief the claimant requests is not granted.

(b) The decision of the higher settlement authority is the final administrative action on the claim.
