####### SF 703, TOP SECRET Cover Sheet:

(6)The SF 703 serves as a shield to protect Top Secret classified information from inadvertent disclosure and to alert observers that Top Secret information is attached to it. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a TOP SECRET cover sheet is required, the SF 703 will be used. The SF 703 is affixed to the top of the Top Secret document and remains attached until the document is downgraded, requiring the appropriate classification level cover sheet, declassified, or destroyed. When the SF 703 has been appropriately removed, it may, depending upon its condition, be reused. The national stock number of the SF 703 is 7540-01-213-7901.
