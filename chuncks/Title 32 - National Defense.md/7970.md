####### Charges for Healthcare services other than inpatient deductible amount.

(c)(1) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may establish charge amounts for Medicare supplemental plans to collect reasonable charges for inpatient and outpatient copayments and other services covered by the Medicare supplemental plan. Any such schedule of charge amounts shall:

(ii) Include adjustments, as appropriate, to identify major components of the all inclusive per diem or per visit rates for which Medicare has special rules.

(iii) Provide for offsets and/or refunds to ensure that Medicare supplemental insurers are not required to pay a limited benefit more than one time in cases in which beneficiaries receive similar services from both a facility of the uniformed services and a Medicare certified provider; and

(iv) Otherwise conform with the requirements of this section and this part.

(2) If collections are sought under paragraph (c) of this section, the effective date of such collections will be prospective from the date the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections, and will exempt policies in continuous effect without amendment or renewal since the date the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections.
