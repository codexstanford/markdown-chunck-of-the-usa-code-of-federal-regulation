() The services of a registered nurse who is not a certified nurse midwife may be authorized only when the patient has been referred for care by a licensed physician and a licensed physician provides continuing supervision of the course of care. A lay midwife who is neither a certified nurse midwife nor a registered nurse is not a CHAMPUS-authorized provider, regardless of whether the services rendered may otherwise be covered.
