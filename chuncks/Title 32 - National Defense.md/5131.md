() The incapacity is continuous. (If the incapacity significantly improves or ceases at any time, CHAMPUS eligibility cannot be reinstated on the basis of the incapacity, unless the incapacity recurs and the beneficiary is under age 21, or is under age 23 and is enrolled as a full-time student under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)()() of this section. If the child was not incapacitated after that date, no CHAMPUS eligibility exists on the basis of the incapacity. However, incapacitated children who marry and who subsequently become unmarried through divorce, annulment, or death of spouse, may be reinstated as long as they still meet all other requirements).
