###### Auxiliary aids

means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities conducted by the NACIC. For example, auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired vision include readers, materials in Braille, audio recordings, and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired hearing include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's), interpreters, notetakers, written materials, and other similar services and devices. The CIA, where NACIC is physically located, may prohibit from any of its facilities any auxiliary aid, or category of auxiliary aid that the Center for CIA Security (CCS) determines creates a security risk or potential security risk. CCS reserves the right to examine any auxiliary aid brought into the NACIC facilities at CIA Headquarters.
