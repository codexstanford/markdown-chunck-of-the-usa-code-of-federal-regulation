####### DRG system updates.

(D)The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) and uses annually updated items and numbers from the Medicare PPS as provided for in this part and in instructions issued by the Director, DHA. The effective date of these items and numbers shall not correspond to that under Medicare PPS but shall be delayed until January 1, to align with TRICARE's program year reporting. This allows for an administrative simplicity that optimizes healthcare delivery by reducing existing administrative burden and costs.
