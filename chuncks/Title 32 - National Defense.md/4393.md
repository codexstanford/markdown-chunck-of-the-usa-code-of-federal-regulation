####### Tiering.

6.Consideration should be given to tiering of environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issue and to focus the issues. Tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements, with succeeding narrower statements or environmental analyses that incorporate by reference the general discussion and concentrate only on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.
