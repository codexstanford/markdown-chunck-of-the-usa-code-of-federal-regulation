####### ยง 757.19 Waiver and compromise.
######## Waiver and compromise.

(b)The JAG designee may waive the Federal government's MCRA interest when a responsible third-party tortfeasor cannot be located, is judgment proof, or has refused to pay and litigation is not feasible. Waiver or compromise is also appropriate when, upon written request by the injured person or legal representative, it is determined that collection of the full amount of the claim would result in undue hardship to the injured person. In assessing undue hardship, the following should be considered:

(1) Permanent disability or disfigurement;

(2) Lost earning capacity;

(3) Out-of-pocket expenses;

(4) Financial status;

(5) Disability, pension and similar benefits available;

(6) Amount of settlement or award from third-party tortfeasor or contract insurer; and

(7) Any other factors which objectively indicate fairness requires waiver.
