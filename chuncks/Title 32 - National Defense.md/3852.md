####### Glasses and Contact Lenses.

(c)If vision correction is required, contractor personnel will be required to have two pair of glasses. A written prescription may also be provided to the supporting military medical component so that eyeglass inserts for use in a compatible chemical protective mask can be prepared. If the type of protective mask to be issued is known and time permits, the preparation of eyeglass inserts should be completed prior to deployment. Wearing contact lenses in a field environment is not recommended and is at the contingency contractor employee's own risk due to the potential for irreversible eye damage caused by debris, chemical or other hazards present, and the lack of ophthalmologic care in a field environment.
