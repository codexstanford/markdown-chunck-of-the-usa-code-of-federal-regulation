(1) Require these KMP to be determined to be eligible for access to classified information as a requirement for the entity's eligibility determination or;

(2) Allow the entity to formally exclude these KMP from access to classified information. The entity's governing board will affirm the exclusion by issuing a formal action (see table), and provide a copy of the exclusion action to the CSA. The entity's governing board will document this exclusion action.
