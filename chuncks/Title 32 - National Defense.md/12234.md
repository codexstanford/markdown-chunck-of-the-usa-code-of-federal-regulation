####### Criteria for Laboratory Consortium Membership.

The following criteria for the participation of a DOD Laboratory in Consortium activities shall apply:

- The participation of any laboratory shall be undertaken with the full knowledge of the parent Military Department and the director or commander of the laboratory.

- For each participating laboratory an individual shall be designated by name to represent that laboratory to the consortium, and to coordinate the technology transfer activities of that laboratory. Procedures should be adopted within each laboratory to preclude the dilution of the efforts of middle and top level management by their involvement in the administrative aspects of the technology transfer effort.

- Any laboratory may withdraw from the Consortium by notifying the Consortium Chairman of this intent.
