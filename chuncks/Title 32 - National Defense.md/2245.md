####### Timely completion.

(5)To ensure timely completion, the DoD Components will establish procedures to initiate or request criminal history background check results, follow up to ensure checks have been completed, and address situations where there is a delay in receiving results. In no event will an individual subject to this part be presumed to have a favorable background check merely because there has been a delay in receiving the results of the requisite background check. If no response from the state(s) is received within 60 days, determinations based upon the CNACI report may be made.
