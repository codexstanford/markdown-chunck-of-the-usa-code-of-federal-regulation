(3)Using the RAPIDS platform, DoD PKI identity and PIV authentication certificates will be issued on the CAC at the time of card issuance in compliance with OPM Memorandum, "Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity Verification Cards under HSPD-12." Email signature, email encryption, or PIV authentication certificates may also be available on the CAC either upon issuance or at a later time. If the person receiving a CAC does not have an organization email address assigned to them, they may return to a RAPIDS terminal or use milConnect to receive their email certificate when the email address has been assigned. To help prevent inadvertent disclosure of controlled information, email addresses assigned by an organization shall comply with DoD Instruction 8500.2, "Information Awareness (IA) Implementation" (available at).
