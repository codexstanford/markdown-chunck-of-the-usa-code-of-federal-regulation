###### § 203.5 TAPP process.
####### Identification of proposed TAPP project.

(b)Eligible applicants of RABs and TRCs, established in § 203.7 of this part, should determine whether a TAPP project is required to assist the community members of the RAB or TRC to interpret information regarding the nature and extent of contamination or the proposed remedial actions. Eligibility requirements for TAPP projects are described in §§ 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. In keeping with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(e), the RAB or TRC must be able to demonstrate that the technical expertise necessary for the proposed TAPP project is not available through the Federal, State, or local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental restoration at the installation, or that the selection of an independent provider will contribute to environmental restoration activities and the community acceptance of such activities. In addition, the Department of Defense encourages the RAB or TRC to seek other available sources of assistance prior to submitting a request for TAPP in order to preserve limited resources. These sources include DoD's installation restoration contractor, or other DoD contractors or personnel, EPA or state regulatory personnel, volunteer services from local universities or other experts, or assistance from state and local health and environmental organizations.
