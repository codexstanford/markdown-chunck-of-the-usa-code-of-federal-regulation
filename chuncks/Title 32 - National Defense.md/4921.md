####### Duplicate equipment.

An item of durable equipment, durable medical equipment, or assistive technology items, as defined in this section that serves the same purpose that is served by an item of durable equipment, durable medical equipment, or assistive technology item previously cost-shared by TRICARE. For example, various models of stationary oxygen concentrators with no essential functional differences are considered duplicate equipment, whereas stationary and portable oxygen concentrators are not considered duplicates of each other because the latter is intended to provide the user with mobility not afforded by the former. Also, a manual wheelchair and electric wheelchair, both of which otherwise meet the definition of durable equipment or durable medical equipment, would not be considered duplicates of each other if each is found to provide an appropriate level of mobility. For the purpose of this Part, durable equipment, durable medical equipment, or assistive technology items that are essential in providing a fail-safe in-home life support system or that replace in-like-kind an item of equipment that is not serviceable due to normal wear, accidental damage, a change in the beneficiary's condition, or has been declared adulterated by the U.S. FDA, or is being or has been recalled by the manufacturer is not considered duplicate equipment.
