####### John Doe,Private Paul Jones,

I request that the Attorney General of the United States, or his agent, designate counsel to defend me in my official and individual capacities in the case ofv.now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. I have read the complaint filed in this case and I declare that all my actions were performed in my official capacity, within the scope of my official duties, and in a good faith belief that my actions conformed to the law. I am not aware of any pending related criminal investigation.

I understand the following: if my request for representation is approved, I will be represented by a U.S. Department of Justice attorney; that the United States is not required to pay any final adverse money judgment rendered against me personally, although I can request indemnification; that I am entitled to retain private counsel at my own expense; and, that the Army expresses no opinion whether I should or should not retain private counsel.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. ยง 1746).

Executed on: __________
