Conduct that is an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if the conduct had been engaged in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. See sections 3261 of the Act and 18 U.S.C. 7. Although the Act, uses the conditional phrase "if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States," acts that would be a Federal crime regardless of where they are committed in the U.S., such as drug crimes contained in chapter 13 of title 21, United States Code, also fall within the scope of section 3261(a) of the Act. See the analysis to section 3261 of the Report Accompanying the Act.
