####### ICU.

(iii)An ICU is a special segregated unit of a hospital in which patients are concentrated, by reason of serious illness, usually without regard to diagnosis. Special lifesaving techniques and equipment are available regularly and immediately within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type of patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing, rather than an intermittent or temporary, basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room or a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be refined further for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU.
