##### ยง 2402.9 Fees.
###### Advance payments.

(e)Fees may be paid upon provision of the requested records, except that payment may be required prior to that time if the requester has previously failed to pay fees or if OSTP determines that the total fees will exceed $250. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in ยง 2402.6 shall not be deemed to begin until OSTP has received payment of the assessed fees. If the requester has previously failed to pay fees or charges are likely to exceed $250, OSTP shall notify the requester of the estimated cost and:

(1) Obtain satisfactory assurance from the requester, in writing, of full payment; or

(2) OSTP may require the requester to pay the full amount of any fees owed or make an advance payment of the full amount of OSTP's estimated charges.

(3) If OSTP does not receive an adequate response, assurance, or advance payment within thirty (30) calendar days of a fee determination or notification issued under the authority of this section, OSTP will administratively close the corresponding request.
