(2)(i) The ADR procedures or techniques to be used may either be agreed upon by the Government and the recipient in advance (e.g., when agreeing on the terms and conditions of the grant or cooperative agreement), or may be agreed upon at the time the parties determine to use ADR procedures.

(ii) If a grants officer and a recipient are not able to resolve an issue through unassisted negotiations, the grants officer shall encourage the recipient to enter into ADR procedures. ADR procedures may be used prior to submission of a recipient's claim or at any time prior to the Grant Appeal Authority's decision on a recipient's appeal (see paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section).
