() In most instances, property issues will be from DLA Disposition Services inventories. The most commonly requested types of property are medical equipment, field gear, tools, clothing, rations, light vehicles, construction, and engineering equipment. DLA Disposition Services sites will issue all property destined for the HAP, with the exception of drugs and biologicals (Federal Supply Classification Code (FSC) 6505), which may be issued directly by the Military Departments. HAP orders and issues will be documented on DD Form 1348-1A "Issue Release/Receipt Document."
