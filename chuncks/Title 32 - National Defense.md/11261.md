The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States.32 CFR ยง 516.48.

If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

Sincerely,
