(a)-(1)(i) DoD ELAP provides a unified DoD program through which commercial environmental laboratories can voluntarily demonstrate competency and document conformance to the international standard established in ISO/IEC 17025:2005 as implemented by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security Memorandum, "DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories" (available at) (referred to in this part as the "DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories (QSM)"). The DoD QSM provides minimum quality systems requirements, based on ISO/IEC 17025:2005, for environmental laboratories performing testing for DoD.

(ii) DoD ELAP was developed in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 3701 (also known as the "National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act"). Support and guidance was provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, following procedures used to establish similar programs for other areas of testing. The DoD ELAP supports implementation of section 515 of Public Law 106-554, "Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001" and Office of Management and Budget Guidance, "Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies" (67 FR 8452) as implemented by Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "Ensuring Quality of Information Disseminated to the Public by the Department of Defense."
