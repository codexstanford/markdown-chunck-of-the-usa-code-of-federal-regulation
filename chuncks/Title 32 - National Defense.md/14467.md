(3)DD Form 293 provides applicants with a standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:

(i) Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, provide a basis for changing the discharge;

(ii) Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be important by an applicant;

(iii) Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a decisional issue under ยง 865.112, and those matters submitted simply as background or supporting materials;

(iv) Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that the applicant later submits a complaint under ยง 865.121 of this subpart concerning the decisional document.

(v) Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an applicant's issue.
