####### SF 714, Financial Disclosure Report:

(15)When required by an agency head or by the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, the SF 714 contains information that is used to make personnel security determinations, including whether to grant a security clearance; to allow access to classified information, sensitive areas, and equipment; or to permit assignment to sensitive national security positions. The data may later be used as a part of a review process to evaluate continued eligibility for access to classified information or as evidence in legal proceedings. The SF 714 assists law enforcement agencies in obtaining pertinent information in the preliminary stages of potential espionage and counter terrorism cases.
