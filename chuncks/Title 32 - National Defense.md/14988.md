###### Commercial use requesters.

(1)A request for documents for commercial use will be assessed charges which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the record sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The cost of searching for and reviewing records will be recovered even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section).
