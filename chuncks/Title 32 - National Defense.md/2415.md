####### Collateral misconduct.,e.g.,

Victim misconduct that might be in time, place, or circumstance associated with the victim's sexual assault incident. Collateral misconduct by the victim of a sexual assault is one of the most significant barriers to reporting assault because of the victim's fear of punishment. Some reported sexual assaults involve circumstances where the victim may have engaged in some form of misconduct (underage drinking or other related alcohol offenses, adultery, fraternization, or other violations of certain regulations or orders).
