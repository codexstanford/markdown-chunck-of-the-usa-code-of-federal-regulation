###### ยง 199.3 Eligibility.
####### Dual eligibility.

(d)Dual eligibility occurs when a person is entitled to benefits from two sources. For example, when an active duty member is also the dependent of another active duty member, a retiree, or a deceased active duty member or retiree, dual eligibility, that is, entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services medical care system and CHAMPUS is the result. Since the active duty status is primary, and it is the intent that all medical care be provided an active duty member through the Uniformed Services medical care system, CHAMPUS eligibility is terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the dual eligibility begins. However, any dependent children in a marriage of two active duty persons or of an active duty member and a retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor. Should a spouse or dependent who has dual eligibility leave active duty status, that person's CHAMPUS eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends, if he or she otherwise is eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor.
