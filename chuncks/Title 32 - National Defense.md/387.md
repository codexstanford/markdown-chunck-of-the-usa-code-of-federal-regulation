######### Pre-award review of certain procurements.

(b)Prior to awarding a procurement contract under an award, a recipient may be required to provide the grants officer administering the award with pre-award documents (e.g., requests for proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) related to the procurement. Recipients will only be required to provide such documents for the grants officer's pre-award review in exceptional cases where the grants officer judges that there is a compelling need to do so. In such cases, the grants officer must include a provision in the award that states the requirement.
