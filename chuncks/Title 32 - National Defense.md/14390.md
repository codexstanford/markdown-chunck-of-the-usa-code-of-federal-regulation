####### Reinstatement.

(3)(i) The CARB may consider reinstating a suspended carrier on either CARB motion or carrier motion, unless such carrier has become ineligible in the interim.

(ii) The carrier has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that reinstatement is warranted. The air carrier must satisfy the CARB that the deficiencies, which led to suspension, have been corrected and that action has been implemented to preclude the recurrence of similar deficiencies.

(iii) Air carrier evidence in support of reinstatement will be provided in a timely manner to the CARB for its review. The CARB may independently corroborate the carrier-provided evidence and may, at its option, convene a hearing and request the participation of the air carrier.
