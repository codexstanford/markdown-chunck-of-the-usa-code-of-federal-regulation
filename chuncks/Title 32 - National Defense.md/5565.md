####### General exclusion.

(iii)Domiciliary care is institutionalization essentially to provide a substitute home-not because it is medically necessary for the beneficiary to be in the institution (although there may be conditions present that have contributed to the fact that domiciliary care is being rendered). CHAMPUS benefits are not payable for any costs or charges related to the provision of domiciliary care. While a substitute home or assistance may be necessary for the beneficiary, domiciliary care does not represent the kind of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be provided.
