####### Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history background check.

An FBI identification record-often referred to as a criminal history record or a "rapsheet"-is a listing of certain information taken from fingerprint submissions retained by the FBI in connection with arrests and, in some instances, federal employment, naturalization, or military service. The process of responding to an identification record request is generally known as a criminal history background check.
