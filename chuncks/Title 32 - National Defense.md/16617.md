##### ยง 2402.6 Timing of responses to requests.
###### Track three-complex requests.

(iii)Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records, require lengthy or numerous consultations, raise unique or novel legal questions, or require submitter review under ยง 2402.7.

(2) OSTP may provide requesters with requests in slower track(s) the opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of faster track(s). OSTP will do so by contacting the requester by letter, telephone, email, or facsimile, whichever is more efficient in each case. When providing a requester with the opportunity to limit the scope of a request, OSTP shall also advise the requester of OSTP's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any dispute arising between the requester and OSTP as well as the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
