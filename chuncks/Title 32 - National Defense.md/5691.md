###### ยง 199.4 Basic program benefits.
####### Beneficiary or sponsor liability,General.

(f)-(1)As stated in the introductory paragraph to this section, the Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. To encourage use of the Uniformed Services direct medical care system wherever its facilities are available and appropriate, the Basic Program benefits are designed so that it is to the financial advantage of a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor to use the direct medical care system. When medical care is received from civilian sources, a CHAMPUS beneficiary is responsible for payment of certain deductible and cost-sharing amounts in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies. By statute, this joint financial responsibility between the beneficiary or sponsor and CHAMPUS is more favorable for dependents of members than for other classes of beneficiaries.
