(8)(i) In accordance with ยง 158.7 of this part, contracts shall require that contractors provide medically and physically qualified contingency contractor personnel to perform duties in applicable contingency operations as outlined in the contract. Any CAAF deemed unsuitable to deploy during the deployment process due to medical or dental reasons will not be authorized to deploy. The Secretary of Defense may direct immunizations as mandatory for CAAF performing DoD-essential contractor services in accordance with Joint Publication 4-0, "Joint Logistics", and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3150.13C. For CAAF who are U.S. citizens, contracts shall require contractors to make available the medical and dental records (including current panographic x-ray) of the deploying employees who grant release authorization for this purpose, according to contract terms based on this section, DoD Directive 6485.02E (see), applicable joint force command surgeon guidance, and relevant Military Department policy.

(ii) Government personnel cannot force a contractor employee to receive an immunization or disclose private medical records against his or her will; therefore, particularly for medical requirements that arise after contract award, the contracting officer will allow contractors time to notify and/or hire employees who are willing to meet Government medical requirements and disclose their private information.
