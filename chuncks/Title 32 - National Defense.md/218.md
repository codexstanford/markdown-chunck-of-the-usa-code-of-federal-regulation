######## Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR),Policy.

(c)-(1)DoD policy is to try to resolve all issues concerning grants and cooperative agreements by mutual agreement at the grants officer's level. DoD Components therefore are encouraged to use ADR procedures to the maximum extent practicable. ADR procedures are any voluntary means (e.g., mini-trials or mediation) used to resolve issues in controversy without resorting to formal administrative appeals (see paragraph (e) of this section) or to litigation.
