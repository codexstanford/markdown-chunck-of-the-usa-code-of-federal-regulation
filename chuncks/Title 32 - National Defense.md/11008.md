(d)(1) TIOH will conduct periodic quality control inspections of on hand stocks of heraldic items maintained by:

(ii) Certified manufacturers.

(2) Upon completion of quality control inspections, TIOH will provide a report of deficiencies to the appropriate retail outlet or Commander, DLA Troop Support, and the certified manufacturer responsible for the production of the item. The notification to the manufacturer will require assurances of compliance with quality control policies. The report of deficiencies will be reviewed upon recertification of the manufacturer. Any recurrence of the same breach will be considered a refusal to perform, and the Director will take further action to suspend or revoke certification.
