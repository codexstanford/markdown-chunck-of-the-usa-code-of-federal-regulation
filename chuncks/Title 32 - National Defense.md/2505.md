###### ยง 103.6 Reporting options and sexual assault reporting procedures.
####### e.g.,

(1) Require that a SARC be immediately notified when a victim discloses a sexual assault so that the SARC can inform the victim of both reporting options (Restricted and Unrestricted) and all available services (SVC/VLC, Expedited Transfers, Military Protective Orders, document retention mandates). The victim can then make an informed decision as to which reporting option to elect and which services to request (or none at all). The victim is able to decline services in whole or in part at any time.

(2) There must be selection, training, and certification standards for healthcare providers performing SAFEs in MTFs.
