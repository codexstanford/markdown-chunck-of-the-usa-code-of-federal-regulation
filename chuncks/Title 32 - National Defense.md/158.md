####### ยง 22.205 Distinguishing assistance from procurement.
######## Fee or profit.

(b)Payment of fee or profit is consistent with an activity whose principal purpose is the acquisition of goods and services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government, rather than an activity whose principal purpose is assistance. Therefore, the grants officer shall use a procurement contract, rather than an assistance instrument, in all cases where:

(1) Fee or profit is to be paid to the recipient of the instrument; or

(2) The instrument is to be used to carry out a program where fee or profit is necessary to achieving program objectives.
