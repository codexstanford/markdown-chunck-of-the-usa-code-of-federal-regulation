###### ยง 103.6 Reporting options and sexual assault reporting procedures.
####### Mandatory reporting laws and cases investigated by civilian law enforcement.

(d)Health care may be provided, and SAFE Kits may be performed in a civilian healthcare facility in civilian jurisdictions which may require certain personnel (usually health care personnel) to report the sexual assault to civilian agencies or law enforcement. In some cases, civilian law enforcement may take investigative responsibility for the sexual assault case, or the civilian jurisdiction may inform the military law enforcement or investigative community of a sexual assault that was reported to it. In such instances, it may not be possible for a victim to make a Restricted Report or it may not be possible to maintain the report as a Restricted Report. Consistent with the NDAA for FY 2016, to the extent possible, DoD will honor the Restricted Report; however, sexual assault victims need to be aware that the confidentiality afforded their Restricted Report is not guaranteed due to circumstances surrounding the independent investigation and requirements of individual State laws for civilian healthcare facilities.
