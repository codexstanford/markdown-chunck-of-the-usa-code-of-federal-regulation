######## i.e.,,e.g.,

(1) A federal statute authorizing a program that is consistent with an assistance relationship (the support or stimulation of a public purpose, rather than the acquisition of a good or service for the direct benefit of the Department of Defense). In accordance with 31 U.S.C. chapter 63, such a program would appropriately be carried out through the use of grants or cooperative agreements.
