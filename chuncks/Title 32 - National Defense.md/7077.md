###### § 199.14 Provider reimbursement methods.
####### Dialysis training.

(E)To account for training services and supplies, dialysis training sessions will receive a home dialysis training add-on payment for day treatment days 121 and after. The training add-on payment will not apply to treatment days 1-120, as the onset adjustment factor of 32.7% is applied to the per-session rate for treatment days 1-120.

(2) The reimbursement methods established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to freestanding ESRD facilities meeting the requirements established for TRICARE authorized freestanding ESRD facilities in § 199.6. For purposes of cost-sharing and copayments, treatment provided by freestanding ESRD facilities are considered outpatient specialty visits. The applicable copayments and cost-shares described in §§ 199.4 and 199.17(k)(2)(iii) shall apply. Hospital-based ESRD facilities are not subject to the provisions of this paragraph, and will continue to be reimbursed utilizing other applicable reimbursement systems (e.g., the Outpatient Prospective Payment System).
