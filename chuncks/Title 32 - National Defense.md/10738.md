(i)During the processing of a Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act request, exempt materials from other systems of records may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those "other" systems of records are entered into this system, the NRO hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those "other" systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary system of which they are a part.
