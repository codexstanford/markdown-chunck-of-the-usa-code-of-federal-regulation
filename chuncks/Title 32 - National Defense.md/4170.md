######## Documentation required to change a name in DEERS.

(m)This paragraph (m) describes documentation required to change a name in DEERS. Name changes based on a marriage, divorce, or death, are made at the time of enrollment or ID card issuance. An individual's name should be changed in DEERS with documentation shown in Table 35 to this subpart.

(1) To change a name in a DEERS record that was established by an authoritative feed (e.g., uniformed service member records, DoD civilian personnel records), the sponsor will need to first consult the personnel office that established the authoritative feed. If an immediate change is required, the sponsor may visit a RAPIDS site with the applicable documentation identified in Table 35 to this subpart.

(2) To change a name in a DEERS record that was manually established (e.g., dependent records), the sponsor will need to visit a RAPIDS site with the applicable documentation identified in Table 35 to this subpart.
