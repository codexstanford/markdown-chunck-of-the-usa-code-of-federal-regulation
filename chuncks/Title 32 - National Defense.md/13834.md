The term "naval installation" applies to all such areas regardless of whether the areas are being used for purely military purposes, for housing, for support purposes, or for any other purpose by a naval command. Section 770.31 contains a list of the major naval installations in Hawaii. This list is not considered to be all inclusive and is included only as a representative guide. For the purposes of this subpart the area of water within Pearl Harbor is considered to be within a naval installation.
