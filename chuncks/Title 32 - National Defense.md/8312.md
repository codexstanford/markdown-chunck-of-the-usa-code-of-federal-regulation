######## Fair market rental.

(k)A reasonable charge for on-base land, buildings, or building space. Rental is determined by a government appraisal based on comparable properties in the local civilian economy. The appraiser, however, shall consider that on-base property may not always be comparable to similar property in the local commercial geographic area. Examples of circumstances that may affect fair market rental include limitations of usage and access to the financial institution by persons other than those on the installation, proximity to the community center or installation business district, and the government's right to terminate the lease or take title to improvements constructed at the financial institution's expense.
