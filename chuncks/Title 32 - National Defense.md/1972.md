###### ยง 70.10 Complaints concerning decisional documents and index entries.
####### Guidance as to other types of complaints.

(v)The following guidance governs other specified types of complaints:

(A) The Stipulation of Dismissal requires only that those facts that are essential to the decision be listed in the decisional document. The requirement for listing specified facts from the military record was not established until March 29, 1978, in 32 CFR part 70 Decisional documents issued prior to that date are sufficient if they meet the requirements of the Stipulation.

(B) When an applicant submits a brief that contains material in support of a proposed conclusion on an issue, the DRB is not required to address each aspect of the supporting material in the brief. However, the decisional document should permit the applicant to understand the DRB's position on the issue and provide reviewing authorities with an explanation that is sufficient to permit review of the DRB's decision. When an applicant submits specific issues and later makes a statement before the DRB that contains matter in support of that issue, it is not necessary to list such supporting matter as a separate issue.
