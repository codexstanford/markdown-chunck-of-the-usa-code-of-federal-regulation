######## ยง 37.645 Must I require periodic audits, as well as award-specific audits, of for-profit participants?
######### i.e.,

(1) Should require that the participant have an independent auditor (the DCAA or an independent public accountant) conduct periodic audits of its systems if it expends $750,000 or more per year in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards. A prime reason for including this requirement is that the Federal Government, for an expenditure-based award, necessarily relies on amounts reported by the participant's systems when it sets payment amounts or adjusts performance outcomes. The periodic audit provides some assurance that the reported amounts are reliable.

(2) Must ensure that the award provides an independent auditor the access needed for award-specific audits, to be performed at the request of the cognizant administrative agreements officer if issues arise that require audit support. However, consistent with the government-wide policies on single audits that apply to nonprofit participants (see ยง 37.665), you should rely on periodic audits to the maximum extent possible to resolve any award-specific issues.
