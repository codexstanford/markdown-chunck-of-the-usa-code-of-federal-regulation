####### Newborn patient in his or her own right.

(C)When a newborn infant remains as an inpatient in his or her own right (usually after the mother is discharged), the newborn child becomes the beneficiary and patient and the extended inpatient stay becomes a separate inpatient admission. In such a situation, a new, separate inpatient cost-sharing amount is applied. If a multiple birth is involved (such as twins or triplets) and two or more newborn infants become patients in their own right, a separate inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied to the inpatient stay for each newborn child who has remained as an inpatient in his or her own right.
