####### General Policy.

(a)The use of regulatory authority to establish DoD health care eligibility for individuals without a specific statutory entitlement or eligibility shall be used very sparingly, and only when it serves a compelling DoD mission interest. When used, it shall be on a reimbursable basis, unless non-reimbursable care is authorized by this part or reimbursement is waived by the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel & Readiness) (USD(P&R)) or the Secretaries of the Military Departments when they are the approving authority.
