####### Pharmaceutical agents utilized as part of medically necessary medical services.

(xi)In general, the TRICARE-determined allowed amount shall be equal to an amount determined to be appropriate, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments for similar services under Medicare. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1079(q), in the case of any pharmaceutical agent utilized as part of medically necessary medical services, the Director may adopt special reimbursement methods, amounts, and procedures to encourage the use of high-value products and discourage the use of low-value products, as determined by the Director. For this purpose, the Director may obtain recommendations from the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee under ยง 199.21 or other entities as the Director, DHA deems appropriate with respect to the relative value of products in a class of products subject to this paragraph (j)(1)(xi). Among the special reimbursement methods the Director may choose to adopt under this paragraph (j)(1)(xi) is to reimburse the average sales price of a product plus six percent of the median of the average sales prices of products in the product class or category. The Director shall issue guidance regarding the special reimbursement methods adopted and the appropriate reimbursement rates.
