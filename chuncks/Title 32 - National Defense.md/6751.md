####### ii,Annulment.

()A spouse whose marriage to an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is dissolved by annulment loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order. The fact that the annulment legally declares the entire marriage void from its inception does not affect the termination date of eligibility. When there are children, the eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the annulment. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the annulment of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order.
