(ii)The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive.

(A) In the case of services provided by individual health care professionals and other noninstitutional providers, the cost-share shall be the usual percentage of the CHAMPUS allowable charge determined under ยง 199.14(e).

(B) In the case of services provided by institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under ยง 199.14(a)(1) or per-diem amount under ยง 199.14(a)(2)), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the cost-share amount that would apply for a beneficiary other than an active duty dependent pursuant to the normal pre-set rate would be reduced by the same percentage by which the pre-set rate was reduced in setting the discount rate.
