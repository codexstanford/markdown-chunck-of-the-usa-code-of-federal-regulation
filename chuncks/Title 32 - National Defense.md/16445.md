###### ยง 2004.32 Determining entity eligibility for access to classified information.
####### Eligibility criteria.

(e)An entity must meet the following requirements to be eligible to access classified information:

(1) It must need to access classified information as part of a legitimate U.S. Government or foreign government requirement, and access must be consistent with U.S. national security interests as determined by the CSA;

(2) It must be organized and existing under the laws of any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or an organized U.S. territory (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands); or an American Indian or Alaska native tribe formally acknowledged by the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, of the U.S. Department of the Interior;

(3) It must be located in the United States or its territorial areas;

(4) It must have a record of compliance with pertinent laws, regulations, and contracts (or other relevant agreements);

(5) Its KMOs must each have and maintain eligibility for access to classified information that is at least the same level as the entity eligibility level;

(6) It and all of its KMOs must not be excluded by a Federal agency, contract review board, or other authorized official from participating in Federal contracts or agreements;

(7) It must meet all requirements the CSA or the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy establishes for access to the type of classified information or program involved; and

(8) If the CSA determines the entity is under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI), the responsible CSA must:

(i) Agree that sufficient security measures are in place to mitigate or negate risk to national security interests due to the FOCI (see ยง 2004.34);

(ii) Determine that it is appropriate to grant eligibility for a single, narrowly defined purpose (see ยง 2004.34(i)); or

(iii) Determine that the entity is not eligible to access classified information.

(9) DoD and DOE cannot award a contract involving access to proscribed information to an entity effectively owned or controlled by a foreign government unless the Secretary of the agency first issues a waiver (see 10 U.S.C. 2536). A waiver is not required if the CSA determines the entity is eligible and it agrees to establish a voting trust agreement (VTA) or proxy agreement (PA) (see ยง 2004.34(f)) because both VTAs and PAs effectively negate foreign government control.
