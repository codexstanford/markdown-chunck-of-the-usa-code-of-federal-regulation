(h)-(1)Federal claims of $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe on which collection action has been taken under the provisions of this section which cannot be collected or compromised or on which collection action cannot be suspended or terminated as provided herein, will be promptly referred to the Department of Justice for litigation in accordance with 31 CFR part 904. Such referrals shall be made as early as possible consistent with aggressive collection action made by TRICARE contractors and TMA. Referral will be made with sufficient time to bring timely suit against the debtor. Referral shall be made by submission of a completed Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness. Claims of less than the minimum amount shall not be referred unless litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with TRICARE's policies or programs; the claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to the referring office for enforcement; or the debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law and judicial remedies available to the Government.
