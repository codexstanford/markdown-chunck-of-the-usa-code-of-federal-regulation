######## Employees of nonappropriated-fund activities.

(3)Nonappropriated-fund activities are entities established and operated for the benefit of military members and their dependents, and have been judicially determined to be "arms" of the Federal government. These entities operate from self-generated funds, rather than from funds appropriated by Congress. Examples include Navy and Marine Corps Exchanges, officer or enlisted clubs, and recreational services activities. A claim arising out of the act or omission of an employee of a nonappropriated-fund activity not located in a foreign country, acting within the scope of employment, is an act or omission committed by a Federal employee and will be handled in accordance with the FTCA.
