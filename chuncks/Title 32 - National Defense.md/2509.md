###### ยง 103.6 Reporting options and sexual assault reporting procedures.
####### e.g.,

(9) Upon completion of the SAFE, the sexual assault victim shall be provided with a hard copy of the completed DD Form 2911. Advise the victim to keep the copy of the DD Form 2911 in his or her personal permanent records as this form may be used by the victim in other matters before other agencies (Department of Veterans Affairs) or for any other lawful purpose.

(10) Require that healthcare personnel maintain the confidentiality of a Restricted Report to include communications with the victim, the SAFE, and the contents of the SAFE Kit, unless an exception to Restricted Reporting applies. For further information see paragraph (c) of Appendix A to this part.

(11) Require that psychotherapy and counseling records and clinical notes pertaining to sexual assault victims contain only information that is required for diagnosis and treatment. Any record of an account of a sexual assault incident created as part of a psychotherapy exercise will remain the property of the patient making the disclosure and should not be retained within the psychotherapist's record.
