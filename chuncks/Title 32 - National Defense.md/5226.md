###### ยง 199.4 Basic program benefits.
####### General or special education not covered.

(v)Services and supplies related to the provision of either regular or special education generally are not covered. Such exclusion applies whether a separate charge is made for education or whether it is included as a part of an overall combined daily charge of an institution. In the latter instance, that portion of the overall combined daily charge related to education must be determined, based on the allowable costs of the educational component, and deleted from the institution's charges before CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. The only exception is when appropriate education is not available from or not payable by the cognizant public entity. Each case must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits.
