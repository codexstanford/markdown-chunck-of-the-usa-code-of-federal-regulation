###### ยง 525.3 Criteria.
####### General.

(a)(1) Entry authorizations may be issued only after the National Range Commander, the Commander, KMR, or a duly authorized subordinate has determined that the presence of the person, ship, or aircraft will not, under existing or reasonably forseeable future conditions, endanger, place an undue burden upon, or otherwise jeopardize the efficiency, capability or effectiveness of any military installation located within Kwajalein Missile Range or areas contiguous thereto. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to, the true purpose of the entry, the possible burdens or threats to the defense facilities which the presence of the ship, aircraft, or the individual or individuals involved impose or might reasonably be expected to impose on those islands in the Kwajalein Atoll under U.S. Army jurisdiction.

(2) Request for entry authorizations will be evaluated and adjudged as to whether the entry at the time and for the purpose stated will or will not be inimical to the purposes of U.S. national defense.
