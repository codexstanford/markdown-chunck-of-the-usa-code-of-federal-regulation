####### ยง 516.25 DA Form 4.
######## Preparation at the installation level.

(b)A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See figure C-2, appendix G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents. Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically. Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level.
