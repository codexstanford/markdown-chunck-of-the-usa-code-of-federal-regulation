(d)The Agency will utilize every effort to determine within the statutory guideline of ten (10) days after receipt of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However, the current volume of requests require that the Agency seek additional time from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such event, the Agency will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.
