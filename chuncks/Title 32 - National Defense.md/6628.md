####### Collection by salary offset.

(vii)When a debtor is a member of the military service or a retired member and collection by offset against other TRICARE payments due the debtor cannot be accomplished, and there have been no positive responses to a demand for payment, the Director, TMA, or a designee, may refer the debt for offset from the debtor's pay account pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 1007(c), as implemented by Volume 7A, Chapter 50 and Volume 7B, Chapter 28 of the DoDFMR. Collection from a Federal employee may be effected through salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514.

(A) For collections by salary offset the Director, TMA, or designee, will issue written notification, as required by 5 CFR 550.1104(d) at least 30 days before any offsets are taken. In addition, the notification will advise the employee that if he or she retires, resigns or his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, collection may be made from subsequent payments of any nature due from the United States (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave under 31 U.S.C. 3716 due the employee as of date of separation.) A debtor's involuntary payment of all or part of a debt being collected will not be construed as a waiver of any rights the debtor may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary or the employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay. No interest will be paid on amounts waived or determined not to be owed unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.
