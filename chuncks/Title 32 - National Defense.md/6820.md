(3)The provisions of ยง 199.9 shall apply except for ยง 199.9(e). All references to "CHAMPUS contractors", "CHAMPUS beneficiaries" and "CHAMPUS providers" in ยง 199.9 shall be construed to mean the "dental plan contractor", "TDP beneficiaries" and "TPD providers" respectively for the purposes of this section. Examples of fraud include situations in which ineligible persons not enrolled in the TDP obtain care and file claims for benefits under the name and identification of a beneficiary; or when providers submit claims for services and supplies not rendered to Beneficiaries; or when a participating provider bills the beneficiary for amounts over the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges; or when a provider fails to collect the specified patient cost-share amount.
