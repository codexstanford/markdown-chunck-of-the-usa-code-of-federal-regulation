####### Invitations to embark.

(b)(1) Invitations should be extended as far in advance as possible and inclusive information on the following should be provided:

(i) Type, scope and duration of operation or cruise.

(ii) Communications, methods of press transmission, and charges, if any.

(iii) Transportation arrangements.

(iv) Approximate cost of meals and/or quarters, and the statement that the newsman will be expected to pay for these and other personal expenses incurred.

(2) It should be made clear to the newsman that there may be limits on movement from one participating unit to another. If helicopters or highline transfers are to be used, their limitations and hazards should be explained.

(3) On operations where security is critical, embarkation of newsmen may be made contingent to their agreement to submit copy for security review. Under such circumstances, the reason for the review will be made clear prior to embarkation, and every effort will be made to avoid any interpretation of such review as "censorship" or interference with freedom of the press.
