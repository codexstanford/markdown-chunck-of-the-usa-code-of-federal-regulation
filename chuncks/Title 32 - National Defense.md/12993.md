##### PART 723 - BOARD FOR CORRECTION OF NAVAL RECORDS
###### ยง 723.3 Application for correction.
####### Consideration of application.

(e)(1) Each application accepted for consideration and all pertinent evidence of record will be reviewed by a three member panel sitting in executive session, to determine whether to authorize a hearing, recommend that the records be corrected without a hearing, or to deny the application without a hearing. This determination will be made by majority vote.

(2) The Board may deny an application in executive session if it determines that the evidence of record fails to demonstrate the existence of probable material error or injustice. The Board relies on a presumption of regularity to support the official actions of public officers and, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, will presume that they have properly discharged their official duties. Applicants have the burden of overcoming this presumption but the Board will not deny an application solely because the record was made by or at the direction of the President or the Secretary in connection with proceedings other than proceedings of a board for the correction of military or naval records. Denial of an application on the grounds of insufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of probable material error or injustice is final subject to the provisions for reconsideration contained in ยง 723.9.

(3) When an original application or a request for further consideration of a previously denied application is denied without a hearing, the Board's determination shall be made in writing and include a brief statement of the grounds for denial.

(4) The brief statement of the grounds for denial shall include the reasons for the determination that relief should not be granted, including the applicant's claims of constitutional, statutory and/or regulatory violations that were rejected, together with all the essential facts upon which the denial is based, including, if applicable, factors required by regulation to be considered for determination of the character of and reason for discharge. Further the Board shall make a determination as to the applicability of the provisions of the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (10 U.S.C. 1034) if it is invoked by the applicant or reasonably raised by the evidence. Attached to the statement shall be any advisory opinion considered by the Board which is not fully set out in the statement. The applicant will also be advised of reconsideration procedures.

(5) The statement of the grounds for denial, together with all attachments, shall be furnished promptly to the applicant and counsel, who shall also be informed that the name and final vote of each Board member will be furnished or made available upon request. Classified or privileged material will not be incorporated or attached to the Board statement; rather, unclassified or nonprivileged summaries of such material will be so used and written explanations for the substitution will be provided to the applicant and counsel.
