(a) This section establishes procedures to be used by the DOD when, in accordance with references in§ 861.1(a) and (b):

(1) An air carrier is subject to review or other action by the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board, or CARB;

(2) A warning, suspension, temporary nonuse, or reinstatement action is considered or taken against a carrier by the CARB; or

(3) An issue involving an air carrier is referred by the CARB to higher authority for appropriate action.

(b) These procedures apply to air carriers seeking to provide or already providing air transportation services to DOD. It also applies to U.S. or foreign air carriers providing operational support services to DOD which, on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the CARB or higher authority, require some level of oversight by DOD.

(c) An air carrier's sole remedy in the case of a suspension decision by the CARB is the appellate process under this part.

(d) Quality and safety issues relating to air carriers used, or proposing to be used, by DOD, per reference (b) must be referred to the CARB for appropriate disposition.
