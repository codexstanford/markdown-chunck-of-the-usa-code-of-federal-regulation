####### Authorized provider.

(10)A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized in this chapter to provide benefits under CHAMPUS. In addition, to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider, any hospital which is a CHAMPUS participating provider under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, shall be a participating provider for all care, services, or supplies furnished to an active duty member of the uniformed services for which the active duty member is entitled under 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). As a participating provider for active duty members, the CHAMPUS authorized hospital shall provide such care, services, and supplies in accordance with the payment rules of ยง 199.16 of this part. The failure of any CHAMPUS participating hospital to be a participating provider for any active duty member subjects the hospital to termination of the hospital's status as a CHAMPUS authorized provider for failure to meet the qualifications established by this part.
