###### 'commercial use' request

(5) The termrefers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for the use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category the agency must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover where there is reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the agency may seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
