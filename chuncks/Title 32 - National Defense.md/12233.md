####### Consortium Purpose

-The DOD Laboratories are a source of technology for the solution of these civil sector problems which are amenable to technological solutions. The primary role of the in-house laboratories is to provide a research and development base for the development of systems required to fulfill the national security mission of the DOD. However, these laboratories can serve a vital secondary role in the adaptation of technology to other fields and areas of need to the extent that it does not adversely impact on the primary DOD mission. A consortium of DOD Laboratories is formed for the purpose of coordinating interactions with other Federal Agencies and technology users at federal, state, and local level, and of coordinating the efforts in this endeavor. The technology transfer consortium is an association of DOD Laboratories working together through an informal affiliation. The main thrust of the consortium activity is through the individual and cooperative efforts of the laboratories involved, with an emphasis on the transfer and adaptation of technology through person-to-person mechanisms.
