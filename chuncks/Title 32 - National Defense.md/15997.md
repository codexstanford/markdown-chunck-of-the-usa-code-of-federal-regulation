###### ยง 2001.22 Derivative classification.
####### Declassification instructions.

(e)(1) The derivative classifier shall carry forward the instructions on the "Declassify On" line from the source document to the derivative document, or the duration instruction from the classification or declassification guide, unless it contains one of the declassification instructions as listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If the source document is missing the declassification instruction, then a calculated date of 25 years from the date of the source document (if available) or the current date (if the source document date is not available) shall be carried forward by the derivative classifier.

(2) When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more than one source document or more than one element of a classification guide, the "Declassify On" line shall reflect the longest duration of any of its sources.

(3) When a document is classified derivatively either from a source document(s) or a classification guide that contains one of the following declassification instructions, "Originating Agency's Determination Required," "OADR," or "Manual Review," "MR," or any of the exemption markings X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and X8, the derivative classifier shall calculate a date that is 25 years from the date of the source document when determining a derivative document's date or event to be placed in the "Declassify On" line.
