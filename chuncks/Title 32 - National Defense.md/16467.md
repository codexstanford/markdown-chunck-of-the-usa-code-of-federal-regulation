####### National interest determination (NID),Requirement for a NID.

(h)-(1)(i) The CSA must determine whether allowing an entity access to proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests of the United States as part of making an entity eligibility determination in cases in which:

(A) The GCA requires an entity to have access to proscribed information;

(B) The entity is under FOCI; and

(C) The CSA proposes an SSA to mitigate the FOCI.

(ii) This determination is called a national interest determination (NID). A favorable NID confirms that an entity's access to the proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests. If the CSA is unable to render a favorable NID, it must consider other FOCI mitigation measures instead of an SSA or reassess the entity's eligibility for access to classified information.
