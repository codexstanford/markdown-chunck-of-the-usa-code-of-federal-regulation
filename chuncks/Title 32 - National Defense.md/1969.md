####### Scope of review.,Urban Law

(iii)When a complaint concerns a specific issue in the applicant's own discharge review, the complaint review process shall involve a review of all the evidence that was before the DRB or SRA, including the testimony and written submissions of the applicant, to determine whether the issue was submitted, and if so, whether it was addressed adequately with respect to the Stipulation of Dismissal, Settlement Agreement, or related Orders in thecase and other applicable provisions of this Directive. With respect to all other complaints about specific issues, the complaint review process may be based solely on the decisional document, except when the complainant demonstrates that facts present in the review in question raise a reasonable likelihood of a violation of applicable provisions of the Stipulation of Dismissal and a reasonable person, familiar with the discharge review process, could resolve the complaint only after a review of the evidence that was before the DRB.
