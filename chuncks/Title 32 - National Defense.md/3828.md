####### Force Protection and Weapons Issuance.,e.g.,

(5)CCDRs shall develop security plans for protection of CAAF and selected non-CAAF (those working on a military facility or as otherwise determined by the operational commander) in locations where the civil authority is either insufficient or illegitimate, and the commander determines it is in the interests of the Government to provide security because the contractor cannot obtain effective private security services; such services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or threat conditions necessitate security through military means.

(i) In appropriate cases, the CCDR may provide security through military means commensurate with the level of security provided DoD civilians. Specific security measures shall be mission and situation dependent as determined by the CCDR and provided to the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall include in the contract the level of protection to be provided to contingency contractor personnel as determined by the CCDR or subordinate JFC. Specific procedures for determining requirements for and integrating contractors into the JOA force protection structure will be placed on the geographic CCDR Web sites.
