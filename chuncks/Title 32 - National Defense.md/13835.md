######## Outleased areas.

(b)Certain portions of naval installations in Hawaii which are not for the time needed for public use or for which a dual use is feasible have been outleased to private interests. Examples of such outleased areas are the Moanalua Shopping Center and lands such as Waipio Peninsula, which has been outleased for agricultural purposes. For the purpose of this Subpart, outleased areas which are not within fenced portions of naval installations are not considered to be a part of naval installations. Rules for entry onto the outleased areas are made by the lessees, except in the case of Waipio Peninsula where the lessee (Oahu Sugar Company) is not authorized to allow anyone to enter Waipio Peninsula for any purpose not connected with sugar cane production.
