####### ยง 26.230 How and when must I identify workplaces?

(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each DOD Component award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces-

(1) To the DOD Component official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by DOD Component officials or their designated representatives.
