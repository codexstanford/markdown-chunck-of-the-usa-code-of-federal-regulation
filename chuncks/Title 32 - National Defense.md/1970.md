###### ยง 70.10 Complaints concerning decisional documents and index entries.
####### Allegations pertaining to an applicant's submission.

(iv)The following additional requirements apply to complaints about modification of an applicant's issue or the failure to list or address an applicant's issue:

(A) When the complaint is submitted by the applicant, and the record of the hearing is ambiguous on the question whether there was a meeting of minds between the applicant and the DRB as to modification or omission of the issue, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the applicant.

(B) When the complaint is submitted by a person other than the applicant, it must set forth facts (other than the mere omission or modification of an issue) demonstrating a reasonable likelihood that the issue was omitted or modified without the applicant's consent.

(C) When the complaint is rejected on the basis of the presumption of regularity, the response to the complaint must be set forth the reasons why the evidence submitted by the complainant was not sufficient to overcome the presumption.

(D) With respect to decisional documents issued on or after the effective date of the amendments to ยง 70.8, any change in wording of an applicant's issue which is effected in violation of the principles set forth in ยง 70.8(a)(5)(iii) constitutes an error requiring corrective action. With respect to a decisional document issued before that date, corrective action will be taken only when there has been a complaint by the applicant or counsel with respect to the applicant's own decisional document and it is determined that the wording was changed or the issue was omitted without the applicant's consent.
