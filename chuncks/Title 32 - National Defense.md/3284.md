(a)This section contains the special requirements for protection of CNDWI. The sensitivity of DoD CNWDI is such that access shall be granted to the absolute minimum number of employees who require it for the accomplishment of assigned responsibilities on a classified contract. Because of the importance of such information, special requirements have been established for its control. DoDI 5210.02, "Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data" (available at:) establishes these controls in the DoD.
