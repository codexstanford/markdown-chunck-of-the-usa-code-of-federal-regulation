(3)The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the Federal agency to which a referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as an exemption that protects personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party is not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion into the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could harm national security interests. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, OSTP will coordinate with the agency that created the record to seek its views on disclosure of the record. OSTP will then notify the requester of the disclosure determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination.
