##### ยง 2402.6 Timing of responses to requests.
###### Extensions of response time in "unusual circumstances."

(c)(1) The twenty (20)-working day period provided in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended if unusual circumstances arise. If an extension is necessary, OSTP shall promptly notify the requester of the extension, briefly state the reasons for the extension, and estimate when a response will be issued. Unusual circumstances warranting extension are:

(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

(2) After OSTP notifies the requester of the reasons for the delay, the requester will have an opportunity to modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for completion of the request. To assist in this process, OSTP shall advise the requester of the availability of OSTP's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and OSTP, and notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

(3) If no initial determination is made at the end of the twenty-day period provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, including any extension provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the requester may appeal the action to the FOIA Appeals Officer.
