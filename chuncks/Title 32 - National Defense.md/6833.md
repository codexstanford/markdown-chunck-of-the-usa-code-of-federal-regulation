() Decisions relating to the issuance of a nonavailability statement (NAS) in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for an NAS or a refusal to issue an NAS are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a dental emergency for which an NAS is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue.
