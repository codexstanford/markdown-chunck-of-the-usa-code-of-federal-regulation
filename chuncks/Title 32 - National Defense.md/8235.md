(6) Advertising in government-funded (official) installation papers is not permitted with the exception of insert advertising in theoverseas. Installation newspapers funded by advertisers are not official publications and, thus, may include advertising paid for by any financial institution.

(7) Installation activities, including Military Exchange Services and concessionaire outlets, shall not permit the distribution of literature from off-base financial institutions if there is an on-base financial institution. This does not prevent the Military Exchange Services from distributing literature on affinity credit card services that those Military Exchange Services may acquire centrally through competitive solicitation.
