###### ยง 199.3 Eligibility.
####### General.

(a)This section sets forth those persons who, by the provisions of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, are eligible for CHAMPUS benefits. A determination that a person is eligible does not automatically entitle such a person to CHAMPUS payments. Before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, additional requirements, as set forth in other sections of this part, must be met. Additionally, the use of CHAMPUS may be denied if a Uniformed Service medical treatment facility capable of providing the needed care is available. CHAMPUS relies primarily on the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for eligibility verification.
