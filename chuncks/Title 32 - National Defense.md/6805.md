####### Authorized provider status does not guarantee payment of benefits.

(2)The fact that a provider is "authorized" is not to be construed to mean that the TDP will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, also must determine if the patient is an eligible beneficiary, whether the services or supplies billed are authorized and medically necessary, and whether any of the authorized exclusions of otherwise qualified providers presented in this section apply.
