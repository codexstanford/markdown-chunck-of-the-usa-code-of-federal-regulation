###### ยง 199.20 Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP).
####### Purpose.

(a)The CHCBP is a premium-based temporary health care coverage program, authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1078a, and available to individuals who meet the eligibility and enrollment criteria as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The CHCBP is not part of the TRICARE program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under similar rules and procedures to the TRICARE Select program. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for Department of Defense and the other uniformed services beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent practicable, to be part of the TRICARE Select program. Medical coverage under this program will be the same as the benefits payable under the TRICARE Select program. There is a cost for enrollment to the CHCBP and these premium costs must be paid by CHCBP enrollees before any care may be cost shared.
