######## Automated Teller Machine (ATM).

(a)An electronic machine that dispenses cash, and may perform such other functions as funds transfers among a customer's various accounts and acceptance of deposits. Equipment generally is activated by a plastic card in combination with a personal identification number (PIN). Typically, when the cardholder's account is with a financial institution other than that operating the ATM, its use results in the assessment of a fee from the ATM network (e.g., Armed Forces Financial Network (AFFN), Cirrus, or PLUS) that processes the transaction.
