####### Need for surgical assistance.

(iii)Surgical assistance is payable only when the complexity of the procedure warrants a surgical assistant (other than the surgical nurse or other such operating room personnel), subject to utilization review.

When a claim is received for a surgical assistant involving the following circumstances, special review is required to ascertain whether the surgical assistance service meets the medical necessity and other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(A) If the surgical assistance occurred in a hospital that has a residency program in a specialty appropriate to the surgery;

(B) If the surgery was performed by a team of surgeons;

(C) If there were multiple surgical assistants; or

(D) If the surgical assistant was a partner of or from the same group of practicing physicians as the attending surgeon.
