####### ยง 855.14 Unauthorized landings.
######## Inadvertent unauthorized landings.

(c)(1) The installation commander or a designated representative may determine a landing to be inadvertent if the aircraft operator:

(i) Landed due to flight disorientation.

(ii) Mistook the Air Force airfield for a civil airport.

(2) Normal landing fees must be charged and an unauthorized landing fee may be assessed to compensate the Government for the added time, effort, and risk involved in the inadvertent landing. Only the unauthorized landing fee may be waived by the installation commander or a designated representative if, after interviewing the pilot-in-command and appropriate Government personnel, it is determined that flying safety was not significantly impaired. The pilot-in-command may appeal the imposition of an unauthorized landing fee for an inadvertent landing to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU whose decision will be final. A subsequent inadvertent landing will be processed as an intentional unauthorized landing.
