###### ยง 159.5 Responsibilities.

(a) The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) will provide Department-wide policies on the total force manpower mix and labor sourcing, consistent with U.S. law, the FAR, the DFARS, and other applicable Federal policy documents, especially with respect to contracted services and restrictions on functions that contractors may and may not perform. The USD(P&R) will ensure that policies specifically address circumstances where use of PSCs would be inherently governmental or where CCDRs with geographic AORs would need to assess where performance of the function by PSCs or total reliance on PSCs would constitute an unacceptable risk.

(b) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics (DASD(Logistics)), under the authority, direction, and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) and through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, monitors the registering, processing, and accounting of PSC personnel in areas of contingency operations, humanitarian or peace operations, or other military operations or exercises.

(c) The Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), under the authority, direction, and control of the USD(A&S) and through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, ensures that the DFARS and (when appropriate, in consultation with the other members of the FAR Council) the FAR, provides appropriate guidance and publishes contracting requirements pursuant to this part and section 862 of Public Law 110-181.
