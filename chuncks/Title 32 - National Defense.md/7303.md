(2)The Director will identify certain qualifying events that may be the basis for a change in enrollment status during a plan year, such as a change in eligibility status, marriage, divorce, birth of a new family member, relocation, loss of other health insurance, or other events. In the case of such an event, a beneficiary eligible to enroll in a plan may newly enroll, dis-enroll, or modify a previous enrollment during the plan year. Initial payment of the applicable enrollment fee shall be collected for new enrollments in accordance with established procedures. Any applicable enrollment fee will be pro-rated. A beneficiary who dis-enrolls without enrolling at the same time in another plan is not eligible to enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. A beneficiary who is dis-enrolled for failure to pay a required enrollment fee installment is not eligible to re-enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. Generally, the effective date of coverage will coincide with the date of the qualifying event.
