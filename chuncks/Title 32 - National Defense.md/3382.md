####### ยง 147.10 Guideline H - Drug involvement.
######## Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:

(b)(1) Any drug abuse (see above definition);

(2) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;

(3) Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence;

(4) Evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program;

(5) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination.
