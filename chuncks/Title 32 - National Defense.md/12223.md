The Deputy SECDEF, in his memorandum of 21 January 1972 to the Secretaries of the Military Departments, on the above subject, (enclosure 1), outlined broad policy considerations for the DoD Laboratory Consortium formed to coordinate non-defense work being performed by them for other government organizations. In order to establish more precise guidelines for the Consortium, an operating policy has been developed (enclosure 2) which establishes criteria for Consortium membership and the type of work that may be undertaken. Also, the following additional constraints are placed upon the operation of this Consortium;

- The expenditure of in-house effort in any one laboratory shall be limited to 3% of the professional man-years at that laboratory unless expressed approval of the parent Military Department is granted to exceed this limit.

- The DoD commitment to support the brokerage function at the National Science Foundation shall not exceed two man-years per year through FY 76, subject to the continued willingness of the Military Departments to absorb the costs.
