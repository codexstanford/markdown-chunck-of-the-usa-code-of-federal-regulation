######## Trusted Associate Sponsorship System (TASS) (formerly known as Contractor Verification System (CVS)).

A Web application used to verify that CAC applicants have the appropriate government sponsorship for the purpose of issuing CACs. The TASS web interface automates the DD Form 1172-2 for tracking the request process and updating DEERS with applicant information required for CAC issuance. The system also provides a mechanism for periodic re-verification of contractor eligibility to ensure that information is current and contractor CACs do not remain active when not appropriate. This capability will be expanded to support registration and background investigation confirmation for additional CAC eligible populations.
