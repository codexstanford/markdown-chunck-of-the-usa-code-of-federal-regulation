#### PART 1665 - PRIVACY ACT PROCEDURES
##### ยง 1665.2 Requests for access.
###### Exceptions.

(vii)(A) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. The mere fact that records in a system of records are frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not intended to preclude access by an individual to the records which are available to that individual under the other processes such as the Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.

(B) Within any system of records pertaining to possible violations of the Military Selective Service Act, the identity of or any information pertaining to any individual who provides information relating to a suspected violator will not be revealed to the suspected violator. This exemption is made under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
