######## Government contractors.

(2)Government (also referred to as independent) contractors, are those individuals or businesses who enter into contracts with the United States to provide goods or services. Because the definition of "Federal agency," found at 28 U.S.C. 2671, specifically excludes "any contractor with the United States," the United States is generally not liable for the negligence of Government contractors. There are, however, three limited exceptions to the general rule, under which a cause of action against the United States has been found to exist in some jurisdictions. They are:

(i) Where the thing or service contracted for is deemed to be an "inherently dangerous activity";

(ii) where a nondelegable duty in the employer has been created by law; or,

(iii) where the employer retains control over certain aspects of the contract and fails to discharge that control in a reasonable manner.
