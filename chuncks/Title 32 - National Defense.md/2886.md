(A) The contractor is a participant in the NISP based on a requirement to access classified information;

(B) A classified contract under the CSA's cognizance includes provisions for access to, or protection or handling of, CUI; and

(C) The CSA has provided the contractor with specific guidance regarding the assessment criteria and methodology it will use for overseeing protection of the CUI being accessed, stored or transmitted by the contractor as part of the classified contract.
