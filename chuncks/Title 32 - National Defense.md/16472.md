####### Limited eligibility determinations (for entities under FOCI without mitigation or negation).

(i)(1) In exceptional circumstances when an entity is under FOCI, the CSA may decide that limited eligibility for access to classified information is appropriate when the entity is unable or unwilling to implement FOCI mitigation or negation measures (this is not the same as limited eligibility in other circumstances; for more information on limited eligibility in other cases, see ยง 2004.32(f)).

(2) The GCA first decides whether to request a limited eligibility determination for the entity and must articulate a compelling need for it to the CSA that is in accordance with U.S. national security interests. The GCA must verify to the CSA that access to classified information is essential to contract or agreement performance, and accept the risk inherent in not mitigating or negating the FOCI. See ยง 2004.32(b)(3).

(3) The CSA may grant a limited eligibility determination if the GCA requests and the entity meets all other eligibility criteria in ยง 2004.32(e).
