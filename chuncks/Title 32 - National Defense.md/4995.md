####### Nonparticipating provider.

A hospital or other authorized institutional provider, a physician or other authorized individual professional provider, or other authorized provider that furnished medical services or supplies to a CHAMPUS beneficiary, but who did not agree on the CHAMPUS claim form to participate or to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge as the total charge for the services. A nonparticipating provider looks to the beneficiary or sponsor for payment of his or her charge, not CHAMPUS. In such cases, CHAMPUS pays the beneficiary or sponsor, not the provider.
