####### Time and manner.

(7) Payment of compromised claims. (i)Compromised claims are to be paid in one lump sum whenever possible. However, if installment payments of a compromised claim are necessary, a legally enforceable compromise agreement must be obtained. Payment of the amount that TMA has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a TRICARE claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed in the compromise agreement. Any such compromised amount is not settled until full payment of the compromised amount has been made within the time and manner prescribed. Compromise agreements must provide for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness, less sums paid thereon, and acceleration of the balance due upon default in the payment of any installment.
