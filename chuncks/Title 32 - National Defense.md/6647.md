###### ยง 199.11 Overpayments recovery.
####### Basis for suspension.

(4)Collection action may be suspended for the following reasons if future collection action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the claim, considering its size and the amount, which may be realized thereon:

(i) The debtor cannot be located; or

(ii) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

(iii) The debtor is unable to make payments on the government's claim or effect a compromise at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action and;

(A) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started running anew; or

(B) Future collections can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or

(C) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection action will be temporarily suspended and such temporary suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability fully to pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.

(iv) Consideration may be given by the Director, TMA, or designee to suspend collection action pending action on a request for a review of the government's claim against the debtor or pending an administrative review under ยง 199.10 of this part of any TRICARE claim or claims directly involved in the government's claim against the debtor. Suspension under this paragraph will be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether:

(A) There is a reasonable possibility that the debt (in whole or in part) will be found not owing from the debtor;

(B) The government's interest would be protected if suspension were granted by reasonable assurance that the debt would be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; and

(C) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship.

(5) Collection action may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons:

(i) TMA cannot collect or enforce collection of any substantial amount through its own efforts or the efforts of others, including consideration of the judicial remedies available to the government, the debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the debtor under state and federal law;

(ii) The debtor cannot be located, and either;

(iii) The costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable; or

(iv) It is determined that the debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations; or

(v) The debt cannot be substantiated; or

(vi) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy. Collection activity may be continued subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, such as collection of any payments provided under a plan of reorganization or in cases when TMA did not receive notice of the bankruptcy proceedings.

(6) In determining whether the debt should be compromised, suspended or terminated, the responsible TMA collection authority will consider the following factors:

(i) Age and health of the debtor; present and potential income; inheritance prospects; the possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and the availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings;

(ii) Applicability of exemptions available to a debtor under state or federal law;

(iii) Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property may bring at a forced sale;

(iv) The probability of proving the claim in court because of legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute of the facts; the probability of full or partial recovery; the availability of necessary evidence and related pragmatic considerations. Debtors may be required to provide a completed Department of Justice Financial Statement of Debtor form (OBD-500 or such other form that DOJ shall prescribe) or other financial information that will permit TMA to verify debtors' representations. TMA may obtain credit reports or other financial information to enable it independently to verify debtors' representations.
