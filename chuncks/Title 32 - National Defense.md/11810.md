######## Public notice and release of information relative to proposed real estate acquisitions.

(h)It is the policy of the Department of the Army to give notice to the public and to release information to the public as early as possible (at the site selection stage) and as completely as possible, consistent with existing regulations. Even though opposition may develop in some cases because of early release of information as to proposed acquisitions, application of this policy should more often result in favorable public relations, general public support of proposed acquisitions, and material assistance in the selection of sites which will fulfill the military requirement and still have the least impact on the civilian economy. This policy will permit consideration of public preferences in the establishment of military facilities. Section 302 of the Act of July 14, 1960; Pub. L. 86-645, which is applicable to military as well as water resources public works projects, provides for dissemination of information on large new installations.
