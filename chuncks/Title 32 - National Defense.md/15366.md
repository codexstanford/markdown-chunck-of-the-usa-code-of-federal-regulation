####### Procedure.

(b)Requests for expedited processing will be approved only when a compelling need is established to the satisfaction of NACIC. A requester may make such a request with a certification of "compelling need" and, within ten (10) days of receipt, NACIC will decide whether to grant expedited processing and will notify the requester of its decision. The certification shall set forth with specificity the relevant facts upon which the requester relies and it appears to NACIC that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable. A "compelling need" is deemed to exist:

(1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

(2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.
