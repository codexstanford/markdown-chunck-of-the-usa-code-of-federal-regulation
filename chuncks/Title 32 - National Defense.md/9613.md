######## DoD contractors and contractor inventory.,1

(I)() The disposal of DoD contractor inventory is generally the contractor's responsibility in accordance with 48 CFR 45.602-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, unless the contract specifies that excess DoD property be returned to the government, as a result of a determination by the CO at contract expiration that DLA Disposition Services disposal would be in the best interests of the government. Property physically turned in to the DLA Disposition Services site does not qualify for reimbursement to the generating activity.
