######## How and when filed.

(a)A claim is filed when the Air Force receives from a claimant or authorized agent a properly completed SF 95 or other signed and written demand for money damages in a sum certain. A claim may be presented orally only if oral claims are the custom in the country where the incident occurred and the claimant is functionally illiterate. In any case where an oral claim is made, claims personnel must promptly reduce the claim to writing with all particulars carefully noted. A claim belonging to another agency is promptly transferred to the appropriate agency.
