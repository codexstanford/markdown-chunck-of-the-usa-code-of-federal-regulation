######## Ground for new trial.

(e)A new trial may be granted only on grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court-martial.

(1) A new trial shall not be granted on the grounds of newly discovered evidence unless the petition shows that;

(i) The evidence was discovered after the trial,

(ii) The evidence is not such that it would have been discovered by the petitioner at the time of trial in the exercise of due diligence; and

(iii) The newly discovered evidence, if considered by a court-martial in the light of all other pertinent evidence, would probably produce a substantially more favorable result for the accused.

(2) No fraud on the court-martial warrants a new trial unless it had a substantial contributing effect on a finding of guilty or the sentence adjudged.
