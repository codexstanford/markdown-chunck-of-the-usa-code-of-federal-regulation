######## Adopted child.

A child adopted before the age of 21 or, if enrolled in a full-time course of study at an institution of higher learning, before the age of 23. Except for entitlement to medical care, a child with an incapacitating condition that existed before the age of 21 or that occurred while the child was a full-time student prior to the age of 23, may be adopted at any age provided it is determined that there is a BONA FIDE parent-child relationship. Surviving children adopted by a non-military member after the death of the sponsor remain eligible for medical care only.
