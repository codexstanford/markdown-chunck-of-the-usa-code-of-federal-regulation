####### Procedures for determination of eligibility.

(B)Uniformed Service identification cards do not distinguish eligibility for the TDP. Procedures for the determination of eligibility are identified in ยง 199.3(f)(2), except that Uniformed Service identification cards do not provide evidence of eligibility for the TDP. Although OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor must make determinations concerning a member or dependent's eligibility in order to ensure proper enrollment and proper disbursement of appropriated funds, ultimate responsibility for resolving a member or dependent's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services.
