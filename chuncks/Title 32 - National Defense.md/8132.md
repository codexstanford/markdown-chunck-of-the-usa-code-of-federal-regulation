####### Use of the Guidelines.

(a)(1) The guidelines in this section are the basis for determining what unclassified information regarding the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody, in a given technical or programmatic subject area are to be designated as DoD UCNI.

(2) The decision to protect unclassified information as DoD UCNI shall be based on a determination that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody.
