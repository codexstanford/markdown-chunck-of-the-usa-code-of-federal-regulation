####### v,Disabling illness or injury of child age 21 or 22 who has eligibility based on his or her student status.,2

()A child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old who is pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffers a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remains eligible for the TDP for six (6) months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, the TDP can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in full-time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in student status does not have eligibility related to mental or physical incapacity as described in ยง 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(C)().
