###### ยง 765.14 Unofficial use of the seal, emblem, names, or initials of the Marine Corps.
####### Unofficial use or imitation of the Marine Corps emblem, names, or initials.

(2)Requests from civilian enterprises to use or imitate the Marine Corps emblem, names, or initials will ordinarily be approved where use or imitation merely provides a Marine Corps accent or flavor to otherwise fungible goods. Disapproval, however, usually may be expected where such use or imitation reasonably would:

(i) Imply any official or unofficial connection between the Marine Corps and the user;

(ii) Tend to create the impression that the Marine Corps or the United States is in any way responsible for any financial or legal obligation of the user;

(iii) Give the impression that the Marine Corps selectively benefits the particular manufacturer, commercial entity, or other user, as in displaying the Marine Corps emblem, names, or initials on musical instruments, weapons, or the like, and in using the emblem, names, or initials in connection with advertising, naming, or describing products and services such as insurance, real estate, or financial services; or

(iv) Tend to subject the Marine Corps to discredit or would be inimical to the health, safety, welfare, or morale of the members of the Marine Corps.
