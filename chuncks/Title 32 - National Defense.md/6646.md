####### Basis for compromise.

(3)A compromise should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time collection will take. A claim may be compromised hereunder if the government cannot collect the full amount if:

(i) The debtor or the estate of a debtor does not have the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time;

(ii) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced collection of the full amount; or

(iii) The government is unable to enforce collection of the full amount within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; or

(iv) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed; or

(v) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced collection of the full amount.
