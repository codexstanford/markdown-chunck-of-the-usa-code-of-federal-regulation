####### Cafeteria.

A food dispensing facility capable of providing a broad variety of prepared foods and beverages (including hot meals) primarily through the use of a line where the customer serves himself or herself from displayed selections. A cafeteria may be fully automatic, or some limited waiter or waitress service may be available and provided within a cafeteria and table or booth seating facilities are always provided. The DoD Component food dispensing facilities that conduct cafeteria-type operations during part of their normal operating day and full table-service operations during the remainder of their normal operating day are not "cafeterias" if they engage primarily in full table service operations.
