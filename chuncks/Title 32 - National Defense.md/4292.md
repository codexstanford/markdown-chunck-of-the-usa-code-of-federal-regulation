###### § 176.35 HUD's review of the application.
####### Notice of determination.

(c)(1) HUD shall, no later than the 60th day after its receipt of the application, unless such deadline is extended pursuant to § 176.15(a), send written notification both to DoD and the LRA of its preliminary determination that the application meets or fails to meet the requirements of § 176.35(b). If the application fails to meet the requirements, HUD will send the LRA:

(i) A summary of the deficiencies in the application;

(ii) An explanation of the determination; and,

(iii) A statement of how the LRA must address the determinations.

(2) In the event that no application is submitted and no extension is requested as of the deadline specified in § 176.20(c)(5), and the State does not accept within 30 days a DoD written request to become recognized as the LRA, the absence of such application will trigger an adverse determination by HUD effective on the date of the lapsed deadline. Under these conditions, HUD will follow the process described at § 176.40.
