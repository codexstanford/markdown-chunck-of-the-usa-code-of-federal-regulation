() Order a change of placement of the child with a disability to an appropriate interim AES for not more than 45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the child's current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.

(C) At the end of the placement in the appropriate AES, the procedures for placement in an AES may be repeated, with the consent of the Area Director, if the school believes that returning the child to the original placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.

(D) When an appeal has been made by either the parent or the school, the child must remain in the interim AES pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the specified time period, whichever occurs first, unless the parent and the DoDEA school system agree otherwise.
