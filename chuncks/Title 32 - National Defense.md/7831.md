##### PART 216 - MILITARY RECRUITING AND RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS PROGRAM ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
###### ยง 216.3 Definitions.
####### e.g.

(2) When an individual institution of higher education that is part of a single university system (, University of (State) at (City)-a part of that state's university system) has a policy or practice that prohibits, or in effect prevents, access to campuses or access to students on campuses in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to its campus and students as it provides to any other employer, or access to student-recruiting information by military recruiters, or has an anti-ROTC policy, as defined in this rule, it is only that individual institution within that university system that is affected by the loss of Federal funds. This limited effect applies even though another campus of the same university system may or may not be affected by a separate determination under ยง 216.5 (a). The funding of a subelement of the offending individual institution of a single university system, if any, will also be withheld as a result of the policies or practices of that offending individual institution.
