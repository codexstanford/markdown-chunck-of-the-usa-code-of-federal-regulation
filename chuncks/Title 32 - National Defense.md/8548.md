(h) GFI will be issued via both unclassified and classified means. DIB participant handling and safeguarding of classified information shall be in compliance with DoD 5220.22-M, "National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)," available at. The Government shall specify transmission and distribution procedures for all GFI, and shall inform DIB participants of any revisions to previously specified transmission or procedures.

(i) Except as authorized in this part or in writing by the Government, DIB participants may:

(1) Use GFI only on U.S. based covered contractor information systems, or U.S. based networks or information systems used to provide operationally critical support; and

(2) Share GFI only within their company or organization, on a need-to-know basis, with distribution restricted to U.S. citizens.

(j) In individual cases DIB participants may request, and the Government may authorize, disclosure and use of GFI under applicable terms and conditions when the DIB participant can demonstrate that appropriate information handling and protection mechanisms are in place and has determined that it requires the ability:

(1) To share the GFI with a non-U.S. citizen; or

(2) To use the GFI on a non-U.S. based covered contractor information system; or

(3) To use the GFI on a non-U.S. based network or information system in order to better protect a contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support.
