####### Direct commercial arrangements.

(4)(i) The disclosure of classified information may be authorized pursuant to a direct commercial sale with the appropriate export authorization. A direct commercial arrangement includes sales, loans, leases, or grants of classified items, including sales under a government agency sales financing program.

(ii) If a proposed disclosure is in support of a foreign government requirement, the contractor should consult with U.S. in-country officials, normally the U.S. Security Assistance/Armaments Cooperation Office or Commercial Counselor.

(A) Before a contractor makes a proposal to a foreign interest that involves the eventual disclosure of U.S. classified information, the contractor must obtain appropriate government disclosure authorization.

(B) Such disclosure authorization does not equate with authorization for export. Export authorization must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory body.

(iii) The contractor will request a FCL assurance for a foreign entity through the CSA from the security authority of the foreign entity's sponsoring government prior to entering into a contractual arrangement with the foreign entity.
