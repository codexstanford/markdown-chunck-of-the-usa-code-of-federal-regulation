####### Delays in the onset of automatic declassification,Media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.

(n)-(1)An agency head or senior agency official shall consult with the Director of the NDC before delaying automatic declassification for up to five years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification more difficult or costly. When determined by NARA or jointly determined by NARA and another agency, the following may be delayed due to the increased difficulty and cost of conducting declassification processing:

(i) Records requiring extraordinary preservation or conservation treatment, to include reformatting, to preclude damage to the records by declassification processing;

(ii) Records which pose a potential menace to health, life, or property due to contamination by a hazardous substance; and

(iii) Electronic media if the media is subject to issues of software or hardware obsolescence or degraded data.
