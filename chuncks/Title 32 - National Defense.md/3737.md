Contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany the force in applicable contingency operations and who have been afforded CAAF status through Letter of Authorization (LOA). CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen and Third Country National (TCN) employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. forces and who routinely are co-located with U.S. forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel co-located with U.S. forces shall be afforded CAAF status through LOA. In some cases, CCDR subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential Host Nation (HN) or Local national (LN) contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors identified as contractors deploying with the force in DoD Instruction 3020.41 and DoD Directive 3002.01E (see). CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of contingencies within the boundaries and territories of the United States.
