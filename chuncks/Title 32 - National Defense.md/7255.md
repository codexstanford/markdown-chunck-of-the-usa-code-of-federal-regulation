###### ยง 199.17 TRICARE program.
####### TRICARE Select.

(2)TRICARE Select is the self-managed option under which beneficiaries may receive authorized basic program benefits from any TRICARE authorized provider. The TRICARE Select health care plan also provides enhanced program benefits to beneficiaries with access to a preferred-provider network with broad geographic availability within the United States at reduced out-of-pocket expenses. However, when a beneficiary receives services from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network, only basic program benefits (not enhanced Select care) are covered by TRICARE and the beneficiary is subject to higher cost sharing amounts for "out-of-network" care. Those amounts are the same as under the basic program under ยง 199.4.
