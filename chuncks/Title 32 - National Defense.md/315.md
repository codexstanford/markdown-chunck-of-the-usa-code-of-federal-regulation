######## Equipment.

Tangible nonexpendable personal property charged directly to the award having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. That definition applies for the purposes of the Federal administrative requirements in this part. However, the recipient's policy may be to use a lower dollar value for defining "equipment," and nothing in this part should be construed as requiring the recipient to establish a higher limit for purposes other than the administrative requirements in this part.
