####### No known or suspected explosive hazard.

(iii)This category is reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the EHE module.

(4) The EHE module rating shall be considered with the CHE and HHE module ratings to determine the MRS priority.

(5) MRSs lacking information for determining an EHE module rating shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as sufficient data are available. Until an EHE module rating is assessed, MRSs shall be rated as "evaluation pending" for the EHE module.

(b) Chemical Warfare Materiel Hazard Evaluation (CHE) module. (1) The CHE module provides an evaluation of the chemical hazards associated with the physiological effects of CWM. The CHE module is used only when CWM are known or suspected of being present at an MRS. Like the EHE module, the CHE module has three factors, each of which has two to four data elements that are intended to assess the conditions at an MRS.
