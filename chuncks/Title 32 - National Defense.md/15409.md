####### Time for response.

(d)Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the NACIC should provide a response within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the volume of requests may require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to ยง 1801.33. In such event, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her right to file an administrative appeal.
