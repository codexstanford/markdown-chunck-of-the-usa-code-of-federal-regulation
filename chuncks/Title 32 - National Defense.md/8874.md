####### General.

1.The DoD Components and their subordinate commands are authorized to contract in writing for CE publications. The underlying premise of the CE concept is that the DoD Components and their subordinate commands will save money by transferring certain publishing and distribution functions to a commercial publisher selected through a competitive process. The CE publication is printed and delivered to the command, installation, or its readership in accordance with the terms of a written contract. Oral contracts are not acceptable. The right to sell and circulate advertising to the complete readership in the CE publication provides the publisher revenue to cover costs and secure earnings. The command or installation guarantees first publication and distribution of locally-produced editorial content in the publication. The publication becomes the property of the command, installation, or intended reader upon delivery in accordance with terms of the contract.
