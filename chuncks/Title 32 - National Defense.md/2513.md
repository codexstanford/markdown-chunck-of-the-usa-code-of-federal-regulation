###### ยง 103.7 Case management for unrestricted reports of sexual assault.
####### General.

(a)CMG oversight for Unrestricted Reports of adult sexual assaults is triggered by open cases in DSAID initiated by a DD Form 2910 or an investigation initiated by an MCIO. In a case where there is an investigation initiated by an MCIO, but no corresponding Unrestricted DD Form 2910:

(1) The SARC would have no information for the CMG members. During the CMG, the MCIO would provide case management information to the CMG, including the SARC.

(2) The SARC would open a case in DSAID indicating the case status as "Open with Limited Information." The SARC will only use information from the MCIO to initiate an "Open with Limited Information" case in DSAID. In the event that there was a Restricted Report filed prior to the independent investigation, the SARC will not use any information provided by the victim, since that information is confidential.
