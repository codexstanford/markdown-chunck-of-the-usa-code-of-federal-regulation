####### External partnership agreements.

(i)The external partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility Commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized institutional provider, enabling Uniformed Services health care personnel to provide otherwise covered medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries in a civilian facility. Authorized costs associated with the use of the facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures currently applicable under the basic CHAMPUS. Savings will be realized under this type of agreement by using available military health care personnel to avoid the civilian professional provider charges which would otherwise be billed to CHAMPUS.
