####### Requests for extension of time.

(c)When the Agency is unable to meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, it will inform the requester that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time limits, provide an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed within the statutory time limits, or arrange with the requester an agreed upon time frame for processing the request, or determine that exceptional circumstances mandate additional time. In such instances the Agency will, however, inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate.
