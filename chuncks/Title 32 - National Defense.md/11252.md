I am the President of the XYZ Corporation. I request the Attorney General of the United States designate counsel to defend me and my company inv.now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.

I understand that the assumption by the Attorney General of the defense of this case does not alter or increase the obligations of the United States under United States Contract No. WP-70-660415.

I further agree that such representation will not be construed as waiver or estoppel to assert any rights which any interested party may have under said contract.
