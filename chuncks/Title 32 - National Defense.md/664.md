###### ยง 45.11 Calculation of damages: offsets for DoD and VA Government compensation.
####### In general.

(a)Total potential damages calculated under this part, both economic and non-economic, are reduced by offsetting most of the compensation otherwise provided or expected to be provided by DoD or VA for the same harm that is the subject of the medical malpractice claim. The general rule is that prospective medical malpractice damage awards are offset by DoD or VA payments and benefits that are primarily funded by Government appropriations. However, there is no offset for U.S. Government payments and benefits that are substantially funded by the military member. DoD is responsible for determining offsets, but claimants must provide information not available to DoD, but requested by DoD for the purpose of determining offsets.
