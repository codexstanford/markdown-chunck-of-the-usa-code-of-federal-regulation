######## Deployment.

(4)Risk management of a Service member reported to FAP as a domestic abuser prior to a military deployment, when his or her deployment is not cancelled, or reported to FAP as a domestic abuser while deployed requires planning for his or her return to their home station.

(i) The installation FAC should give particular attention to special and early returns so during deployment of a unit, the forward command is aware of the procedures to notify the home station command of regularly-scheduled and any special or early returns of such personnel to reduce the risk of additional abuse.

(ii) An active duty Service member reported as a domestic abuser may be returned from deployment early for military disciplinary or civilian legal procedures, for rest and recuperation (R&R), or, if clinical conditions warrant, for treatment not otherwise available at the deployed location and if the commander feels early return is necessary under the circumstances. To prevent placing a victim at higher risk, the deployed unit commander will notify the home station commander and the installation FAP in advance of the early return, unless operational security prevents such disclosure.
