A system of personnel development that is developed in coordination with the Military Departments and the Director, DoDEA. CSPD is the training of professionals, paraprofessionals, and primary referral source personnel with respect to the basic components of early intervention, special education, and related services. CSPD may also include implementing innovative strategies and activities for the recruitment and retention of personnel providing special education and related services, ensuring that personnel requirements are established and maintaining qualifications to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared to provide special education and related services. Training of personnel may include working within the military and with military families, the emotional and social development of children, and transition services from early intervention to preschool and transitions within educational settings and to post-secondary environments.
