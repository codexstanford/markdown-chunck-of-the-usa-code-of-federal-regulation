####### ยง 842.6 Signature on the claim form.
######## Claim filed by an individual.

(a)(1) A married woman signs her name, for example, Mary A. Doe, rather than Mrs. John Doe.

(2) An authorized agent signing for a claimant shows, after the signature, the title or capacity and attaches evidence of authority to present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative; for example, John Doe by Richard Roe, Attorney in Fact. A copy of a current and valid power of attorney, court order, or other legal document is sufficient evidence of the agent's authority.
