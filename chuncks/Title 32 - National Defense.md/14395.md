###### § 861.6 DOD review of foreign air carriers.
####### Foreign air carriers providing passenger services under the GSA City Pair Program.

(b)Foreign air carriers performing any portion of a route awarded to a U.S. air carrier under the GSA City Pair Program pursuant to a code-sharing agreement with that U.S. air carrier, are generally not subject to DOD survey and approval under §§ 861.4 and 861.5. However, DOD will periodically review the performance of such foreign carriers. This review may consist of recurring performance evaluations, periodic examination of the U.S. code-sharing carrier's operational reviews and assessments of the foreign carrier and, where appropriate and agreed to by the air carriers concerned and DOD, on-site surveys of the foreign air carrier. Such carriers must also meet the 12 months prior experience requirement of § 861.4(e)(1). The CARB or higher authority may prescribe additional review requirements. Should circumstances warrant, use of these air carriers by DOD passengers on official business may be restricted or prohibited as necessary to assure the highest levels of passenger safety.
