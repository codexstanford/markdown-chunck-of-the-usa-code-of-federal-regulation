(a)The objective of the PSP is to ensure persons deemed eligible for national security positions remain reliable and trustworthy.

(1) Duties considered sensitive and critical to national security do not always involve classified activities or classified matters. Personnel security procedures for national security positions are set forth in E.O. 12968, as amended; E.O. 10865, 32 CFR parts 154-155; ICD 704; and DoD Regulation 5220.22-R. The specific procedures applicable in each case type are set forth in DoD issuances.

(2) Employees with access to automated systems that contain active duty, guard, or military reservists' personally identifiable information or information pertaining to Service members that are otherwise protected from disclosure by section 552a of title 5 United States Code, may be designated as national security positions within DoD, where such access has the potential to cause damage to national security.
