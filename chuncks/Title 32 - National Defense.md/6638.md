####### Hearing official's decision.

(F)The Hearing Official's decision will be in writing and will identify the documentation reviewed. It will indicate the amount of debt that he or she determined is valid and shall state the amount of the offset and the estimated duration of the offset. The determination of a hearing official designated under this section is considered an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt and/or the terms of the proposed offset schedule for the purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514. The Hearing Official's decision must be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days from the date the petition for hearing is received by the Office of General Counsel, TMA, unless the debtor requests, and the Hearing Official grants a delay in the proceedings. If a hearing official determines that the debt may not be collected by salary offset, but the Director, TMA, or a designee, finds the debt is still valid, the Director, TMA or a designee, may seek collection through other means, including but not limited to, offset from other payments due from the United States.
