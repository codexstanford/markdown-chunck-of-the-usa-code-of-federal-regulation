####### Criteria for disqualification based on results on criminal history background checks.

(c)The ultimate decision to determine how to use information obtained from the criminal history background checks in selection for positions involving the care, treatment, supervision, or education of children must incorporate a common sense decision based upon all known facts. Adverse information is evaluated by the DoD Component who is qualified at the appropriate level of command in interpreting criminal history background checks. All information of record both favorable and unfavorable will be assessed in terms of its relevance, recentness, and seriousness. Likewise, positive mitigating factors should be considered. Final suitability decisions shall be made by that commander or designee. Criteria that will result in disqualification of an applicant require careful screening of the data. A disqualifying event may be the basis for a non-selection, withdrawal of a tentative offer of employment, ineligibility for facility access, removal from a contract, a suitability action under 5 CFR part 731, a probationary termination, an adverse action, or other appropriate action.
