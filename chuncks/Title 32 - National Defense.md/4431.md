####### Content of the Review.

4.An environmental review is a survey of the important environmental issues associated with the proposed action that is to be considered by the DoD component concerned in the decision-making process. It does not include all possible environmental issues and it does not include the detailed evaluation required in an environmental impact statement under Enclosure 1 of this part. There is no foreign government or international organization participation in its preparation, and the content therefore may be circumscribed because of the availability of information and because of foreign relations sensitivities. Other factors affecting the content are identified under "Limitations," (subsection E.6., of this enclosure). To the extent reasonably practical the review should include consideration of the following:

a. A statement of the action to be taken including its timetable, physical features, general operating plan, and other similar broad-gauge descriptive factors;

b. Identification of the important environmental issues involved;

c. The aspects of the actions taken or to be taken by the DoD component that ameliorate or minimize the impact on the environment; and

d. The actions known to have been taken or to be planned by the government of any participating and affected foreign nations that will affect environmental considerations.
