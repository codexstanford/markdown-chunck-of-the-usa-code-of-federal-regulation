####### Direct competition.

The presence and operation of a DoD Component vending machine or a vending facility on the same DoD-controlled property as a vending facility operated by a blind vendor. Vending machines or vending facilities operated in areas serving employees, the majority of whom normally do not have access (in terms of uninterrupted ease of approach and the amount of time required to patronize the vending facility) to the vending facility operated by a blind vendor, shall not be considered to be in direct competition with the vending facility operated by a blind vendor.
