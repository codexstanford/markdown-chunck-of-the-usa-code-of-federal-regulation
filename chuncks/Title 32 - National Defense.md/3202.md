####### Use of freight forwarders.

(5)(i) A commercial freight forwarder may be used to arrange for the international transfer of classified material as freight.

(A) The freight forwarder must be under contract to a USG agency, U.S. contractor, or the recipient foreign government.

(B) The contract will describe the specific functions to be performed by the freight forwarder.

(C) The responsibility for security and control of the classified material that is processed by freight forwarders remains with the USG until the freight is transferred to a DGR of the recipient government.

(ii) Only freight forwarders that have a valid determination of eligibility for access to classified information and storage capability for classified material at the appropriate level are eligible to take custody or possession of classified material for delivery as freight to foreign recipients. Freight forwarders that only process unclassified paperwork and make arrangements for the delivery of classified material to foreign recipients do not require an eligibility determination for access to classified information.

(iii) A freight forwarder cannot serve as a DGR.
