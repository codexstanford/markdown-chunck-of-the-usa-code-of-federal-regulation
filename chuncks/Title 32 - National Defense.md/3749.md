####### Non-CAAF.

Personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as LN employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or TCNs not routinely residing with U.S. forces (and TCN expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. forces.
