####### ยง 751.9 Presentment of claim.
######## Obviously damaged or missing inventory items that are not reported at delivery.

(1)Claimants are expected to list missing inventory items and obvious damage at time of delivery. Claimants who do not should be questioned. Obviously some claimants will simply not notice readily apparent damage. If, however, the claimant cannot provide an explanation or lacks credibility, payment should be denied based on lack of evidence that the item was lost or damaged in shipment.
