###### ยง 103.6 Reporting options and sexual assault reporting procedures.
####### Victim's perception of the military justice system.

(f)The DoD seeks increased reporting by victims of sexual assault. The Restricted Reporting option is intended to give victims additional time and increased control over the release and management of their personal information and empowers them to seek relevant information and support to make more informed decisions about participating in the criminal investigation. A victim who receives support, appropriate care and treatment, and is provided an opportunity to make an informed decision about a criminal investigation is more likely to develop increased trust of the system which may increase a victim's desire to cooperate with an investigation and convert the Restricted Report to an Unrestricted Report.
