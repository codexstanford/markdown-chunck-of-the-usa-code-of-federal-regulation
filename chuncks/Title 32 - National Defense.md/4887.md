####### Congenital anomaly.

A condition existing at or from birth that is a significant deviation from the common form or norm and is other than a common racial or ethnic feature. For purposes of CHAMPUS, congenital anomalies do not include anomalies relating to teeth (including malocclusion or missing tooth buds) or structures supporting the teeth, or to any form of hermaphroditism or sex gender confusion. Examples of congenital anomalies are harelip, birthmarks, webbed fingers or toes, or such other conditions that the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may determine to be congenital anomalies.
