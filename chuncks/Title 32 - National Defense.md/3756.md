####### Systems support contracts.

Prearranged contracts awarded by Service acquisition program management offices that provide fielding support, technical support, maintenance support, and, in some cases, repair parts support, for selected military weapon and support systems. Systems support contracts routinely are put in place to provide support to many newly fielded weapons systems, including aircraft, land combat vehicles, and automated command and control systems. Systems support contracting authority, contract management authority, and program management authority reside with the Service system materiel acquisition program offices. Systems support contractors, made up mostly of U.S. citizens, provide support in continental U.S. (CONUS) and often deploy with the force in both training and contingency operations. The JFC generally has less control over systems support contracts than other types of contracts.
