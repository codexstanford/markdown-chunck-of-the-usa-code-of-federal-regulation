####### Suspending Administrative Action.

(j)(1) All or any administrative action may be suspended by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pending action in the case by the Department of Defense-Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or the Department of Justice (including the responsible United States Attorney). However, action by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or the Department of Justice, including investigation, criminal prosecution, or civil litigation, does not preclude administrative action by OCHAMPUS.

(2) The normal OCHAMPUS procedure is to suspend action on the administrative process pending an investigation by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or final disposition by the Department of Justice.

(3) Though OCHAMPUS administrative action is taken independently of any action by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or by the Department of Justice, once a case is forwarded to the Department of Defense-Inspector General or the Department of Justice for legal action (criminal or civil), administrative action may be held in abeyance.

(4) In some instances there may be dual jurisdiction between agencies; as in, for example, the joint regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Government Accounting Office regarding debt collection.
