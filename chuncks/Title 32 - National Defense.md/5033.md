####### Progress notes.

Progress notes are an essential component of the medical record wherein health care personnel provide written evidence of ordered and supervised diagnostic tests, treatments, medical procedures, therapeutic behavior and outcomes. In the case of mental health care, progress notes must include: the date of the therapy session; length of the therapy session; a notation of the patient's signs and symptoms; the issues, pathology and specific behaviors addressed in the therapy session; a statement summarizing the therapeutic interventions attempted during the therapy session; descriptions of the response to treatment, the outcome of the treatment, and the response to significant others; and a statement summarizing the patient's degree of progress toward the treatment goals. Progress notes do not need to repeat all that was said during a therapy session but must document a patient contact and be sufficiently detailed to allow for both peer review and audits to substantiate the quality and quantity of care rendered.
