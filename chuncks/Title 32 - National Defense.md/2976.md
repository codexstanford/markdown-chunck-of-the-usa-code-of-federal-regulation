####### Requirement for a National Interest Determination (NID).,e.g.,

(A)Unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation (Section 842 of Pub. L. 115-232), the applicable CSA must determine whether allowing an entity access to proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests of the U.S. with concurrence from controlling agencies, as applicable. Such NIDs will be made as part of an entity eligibility determination or because of a changed condition when a GCA requires an entity to have access to proscribed information and the CSA proposes an SSA as the mitigation measure. The NID can be program, project, or contract specific.
