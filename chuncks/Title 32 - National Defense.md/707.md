####### Subjection to military justice.

(v)Military members are subject to the military criminal justice system. During times of war, "persons serving with or accompanying an Armed Force in the field" are subject to the military criminal justice code. Those who were serving with the U.S. Armed Forces may have been treated as if they were military and subjected to court-martial jurisdiction to maintain discipline. Such treatment is a factor in favor of recognition.
