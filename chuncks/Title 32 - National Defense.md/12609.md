(a) Installation PM/DES will comply with the reporting requirements set forth in AR 608-18 (available at).

(b) In addition to substantiated incidents of domestic violence, installation PM/DES will notify the Family Advocacy Program Manager (FAPM) and Social Work Services (SWS) of all incidents in which a preponderance of indicators reveal a potential risk of reoccurrence and increasing severity of maltreatment which could lead to domestic violence or child abuse. Installation PM/DES will ensure these notifications are recorded in the official military police journal in ALERTS. This is to:

(1) Establish a history of incidents that indicate an emerging pattern of risk of maltreatment/victimization to Soldiers and or Family members. See AR 608-18 for incidents that define maltreatment.

(2) Develop a trend history of unsubstantiated-unresolved incidents in order to prevent possible violence or maltreatment from occurring.
