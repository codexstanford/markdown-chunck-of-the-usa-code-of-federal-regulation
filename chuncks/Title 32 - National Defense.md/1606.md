######## Group therapy.

(i)Group therapy is the preferred mode of treatment for domestic abusers because it applies the concept of problem universality and offers opportunities for members to support one another and learn from other group members' experiences.

(A) The decision to assign an individual to group treatment is initially accomplished during the clinical assessment process; however, the group facilitator(s) should assess the appropriateness of group treatment for each individual on an ongoing basis.

(B) The most manageable maximum number of participants for a domestic abuser treatment group with one or two facilitators is 12.
