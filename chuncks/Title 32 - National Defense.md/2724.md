####### Classified contract

means any contract, license, agreement, or grant requiring access to classified information by a contractor and its employees for performance. A contract is referred to in this rule as a "classified contract" even when the contract document and the contract provisions are not classified. The requirements prescribed for a "classified contract" also are applicable to all phases of precontract, license or grant activity, including solicitations (bids, quotations, and proposals), precontract negotiations, post-contract activity, or other government contracting activity (GCA) programs or projects which require access to classified information by a contractor.
