###### ยง 2001.54 Foreign government information.
####### Restricted and other foreign government information provided in confidence.,e.g.,

(d)In order to assure the protection of other foreign government information provided in confidence (foreign government "Restricted," "Designated," or unclassified provided in confidence), such information must be classified under the Order. The receiving agency, or a receiving U.S. contractor, licensee, grantee, or certificate holder acting in accordance with instructions received from the U.S. Government, shall provide a degree of protection to the foreign government information at least equivalent to that required by the government or international organization that provided the information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, these standards may be less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to U.S. Confidential information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the protection required for U.S. Confidential information, the following requirements shall be met:

(1) Documents may retain their original foreign markings if the responsible agency determines that these markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings. Otherwise, documents shall be marked, "This document contains (insert name of country) (insert classification level) information to be treated as U.S. (insert classification level)." The notation, "Modified Handling Authorized," may be added to either the foreign or U.S. markings authorized for foreign government information. If remarking foreign originated documents or matter is impractical, an approved cover sheet is an authorized option;

(2) Documents shall be provided only to persons in accordance with sections 4.1(a) and (h) of the Order;

(3) Individuals being given access shall be notified of applicable handling instructions. This may be accomplished by a briefing, written instructions, or by applying specific handling requirements to an approved cover sheet;

(4) Documents shall be stored in such a manner so as to prevent unauthorized access;

(5) Documents shall be transmitted in a method approved for classified information, unless this method is waived by the originating government.
