##### PART 199 - CIVILIAN HEALTH AND MEDICAL PROGRAM OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES (CHAMPUS)
###### ยง 199.4 Basic program benefits.
####### Allowable Amount does not exceed Deductible Amount.,2,1

(D)If calendar year allowable amounts for two or more beneficiary members of a family total less than $100.00 ($300.00 if paragraph (f) (2)(i)(B)() of this section applies), but more of the beneficiary members submit a claim for over $50.00 ($150.00 if paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B)() of this section applies), neither the family nor the individual deductible will have been met and no CHAMPUS benefits are payable.

(E) For any family the outpatient deductible amounts will be applied sequentially as the CHAMPUS claims are processed.

(F) If the calendar year outpatient deductible under either paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) or (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in another geographic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable beneficiary or family calendar year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second beneficiary or family calendar year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible.

(G) Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (f)(B)(2)(i) of this section in the case of dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above with Persian Gulf Conflict service, dependents of service members who were killed in the Gulf, or who died subsequent to Gulf service, and of members who retired prior to October 1, 1991, after having served in the Gulf War, the deductible shall be the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section for care rendered prior to October 1, 1991, and the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section for care rendered on or after October 1, 1991.

(H) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may waive the annual individual or family calendar year deductible for dependents of a Reserve Component member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days or a National Guard member who is called or ordered to fulltime federal National Guard duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)). For purposes of this paragraph, a dependent is a lawful husband or wife of the member and a child is defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (2), and (4) of ยง 199.3.
