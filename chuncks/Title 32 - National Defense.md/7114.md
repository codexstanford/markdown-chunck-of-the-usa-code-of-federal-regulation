####### Partial episode payment (PEP).

(3)A PEP adjustment is used for payment of an episode of less than 60 days resulting from a beneficiary's elected transfer to another HHA prior to the end of the 60-day episode or discharge and readmission of a beneficiary to the same HHA before the end of the 60-day episode. The PEP payment is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the 60-day episode during which the beneficiary remained under the care of the original HHA by the beneficiary's assigned 60-day episode payment.
