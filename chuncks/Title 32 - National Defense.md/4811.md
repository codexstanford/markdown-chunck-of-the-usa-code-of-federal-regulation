####### Internal partnership agreements.

(ii)The internal partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized civilian health care provider which enables the use of civilian health care personnel or other resources to provide medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries on the premises of a military treatment facility. These internal agreements may be established when a military treatment facility is unable to provide sufficient health care services for CHAMPUS beneficiaries due to shortages of personnel and other required resources. In addition to allowing the military treatment facility to achieve maximum use of available facility space, the internal agreement will result in savings to the Government by using civilian medical specialists to provide inpatient care in Government-owned facilities, thereby avoiding the civilian facility charges which would have otherwise been billed to CHAMPUS.
