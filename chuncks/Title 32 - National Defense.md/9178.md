######## Scrap segregation and identification.

(c)(1) Separating material at the source simplifies scrap segregation and reduces handling. Commingling material may reduce or, in some instances, destroy the value of the scrap.

(2) Generating activities are responsible for initial identification and segregation. The major basic material or content will be used in the item nomenclature block of the DTID.

(3) Scrap will be segregated to ensure only authorized items are in a scrap pile.

(4) DLA Disposition Services sites will provide guidance and, where possible, containers for use by scrap generators at the source.

(5) The generating activity collecting the scrap or waste will maintain proper segregation of the material and determine a point at which no further material will be added. When scrap piles are being built by the DLA Disposition Services site, the same principles apply. Scrap generated from explosive and incendiary items and chemical ammunition is dangerous and will not be commingled with other types of property.
