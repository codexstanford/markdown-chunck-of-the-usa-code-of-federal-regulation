####### Database of "officially released information."

(b)As an alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many requesters, NACIC maintains a database of "officially released information" which contains copies of documents released by NACIC. Searches of this database can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any, costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate in their correspondence. Consistent with the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, on-line electronic access to these records is available to the public. Detailed information regarding such access is available from the point of contact specified in ยง 1800.3.
