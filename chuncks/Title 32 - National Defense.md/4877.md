####### Chronic medical condition.

A medical condition that is not curable, but which is under control through active medical treatment. Such chronic conditions may have periodic acute episodes and may require intermittent inpatient hospital care. However, a chronic medical condition can be controlled sufficiently to permit generally continuation of some activities of persons who are not ill (such as work and school).
