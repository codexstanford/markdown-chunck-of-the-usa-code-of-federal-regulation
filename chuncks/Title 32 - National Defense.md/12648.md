######## Environmental Assessment.

(d)Proposed Army actions not covered in the first three categories (paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section) must be analyzed to determine if they could cause significant impacts to the human or natural environment (see ยง 651.39). The EA determines whether possible impacts are significant, thereby warranting an EIS. This requires a "hard look" at the magnitude of potential impacts, evaluation of their significance, and documentation in the form of either an NOI to prepare an EIS or a FNSI. The format (ยง 651.34) and requirements for this analysis are addressed in subpart E of this part (see ยง 651.33 for actions normally requiring an EA). The EA is a valuable planning tool to discuss and document environmental impacts, alternatives, and controversial actions, providing public and agency participation, and identifying mitigation measures.
