###### ยง 199.9 Administrative remedies for fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest.
####### In any other case in which the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee), determines that exclusion or suspension of a provider is in the best interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries.

(B)The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may exclude or suspend any provider if it is determined that the authorization of that particular provider under CHAMPUS poses an unreasonable potential for fraud, abuse, or professional misconduct. Any documented misconduct by the provider reflecting on the business or professional competence or integrity of the provider may be considered. Situations in which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take administrative action under this Section to protect CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, a case in which it is determined that a provider poses an unreasonable potential cost to the Government to monitor the provider for fraud or abuse and to avoid the issuance of erroneous payments; or that the provider poses an unreasonable potential harm to the financial or health status of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; or that the provider poses any other unreasonable threat to the interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. One example of such circumstances involves a provider who, for his/her entire practice or for most of his/her practice, provides or bills for treatment that is not a CHAMPUS benefit, resulting in CHAMPUS frequently and repeatedly denying claims as non-covered services. This may occur when a professional provider furnishes sex therapy (a therapy which may be recognized by the provider's licensing authority but which is excluded from CHAMPUS coverage) and repeatedly submits CHAMPUS claims for the services.
