####### Lead time for entity eligibility determination when awarding to an uncleared subcontractor.

(3)Requesting contractors will allow sufficient lead time in connection with the award of a classified subcontract to enable an uncleared bidder to be processed for the necessary entity eligibility determination. When the entity eligibility determination cannot be granted in sufficient time to qualify the prospective subcontractor for participation in the current procurement action, the CSA will continue the entity eligibility determination processing action to qualify the prospective subcontractor for future contract consideration provided:

(i) The delay in processing the entity eligibility determination was not caused by a lack of cooperation on the part of the prospective subcontractor.

(ii) Future classified negotiations may occur within 12 months.

(iii) There is reasonable likelihood the subcontractor may be awarded a classified subcontract.
