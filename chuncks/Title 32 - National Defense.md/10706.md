(i)During the course of a 5 U.S.C. 552 or 5 U.S.C. 552a action, exempt materials from other systems of records may, in turn, become part of the case records in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems of records are entered into this 5 U.S.C. 552 or 5 U.S.C. 552a case record, the NGB hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those other systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary SOR which they are a part.
