####### Court proceeding.

A preliminary hearing held pursuant to Article 32 of the UCMJ; a hearing under Article 39(a) of the UCMJ; a court-martial; a military presentencing hearing; or a military appellate hearing. Conferences, such as those between attorneys and the military judge pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 802 or between attorneys and preliminary hearing officers pursuant to Article 32, are not court proceedings for purposes of this part. If all or part of a court proceeding has been closed to the public by the military judge, preliminary hearing officer, or other official, the victims and witnesses will still be notified of the closed hearing as provided in this part, and of the reasons for the closure. In such a case, the military judge, preliminary hearing officer, or other official may place reasonable limits on the reasons disclosed, if such limits are necessary to protect the safety of any person, the fairness of the proceeding, or are otherwise in the interests of national security.
