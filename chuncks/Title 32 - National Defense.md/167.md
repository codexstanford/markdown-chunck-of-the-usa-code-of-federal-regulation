####### ยง 22.310 Statutes concerning certain research, development, and facilities construction grants.
######## Statutory requirement to use competitive procedures.

(b)(1) A grants officer shall not award a grant by other than merit-based, competitive procedures (as defined by ยง 22.315) to an institution of higher education for the performance of research and development or for the construction of research or other facilities, unless:

(i) In the case of a new grant for research and development, there is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

(ii) In the case of a follow-on grant for research and development, or of a grant for the construction of research or other facilities, there is a statute meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

(iii) The Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a written notice of intent to make the grant. The grant may not be awarded until 180 calendar days have elapsed after the date on which Congress received the notice of intent. Contracting activities must submit a draft notice of intent with supporting documentation through channels to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

(2) Because subsequently enacted statutes may, by their terms, impose different requirements than set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, grants officers shall consult legal counsel on a case-by-case basis, when grants for the performance of research and development or for the construction of research or other facilities are to be awarded to institutions of higher education by other than merit-based competitive procedures.
