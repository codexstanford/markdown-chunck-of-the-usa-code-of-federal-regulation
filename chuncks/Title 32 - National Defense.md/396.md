######### Effects of suspension and termination.

(c)Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the grants officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if the costs:

(1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and

(2) Would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.
