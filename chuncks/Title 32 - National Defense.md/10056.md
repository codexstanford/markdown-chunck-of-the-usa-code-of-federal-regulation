######## Promises of confidentiality.

(b)(1) Only the identity of and information furnished by sources that have been given an express promise of confidentiality may be protected from disclosure under this section, consistent with (k)(2), (k)(5), and (k)(7) of the Privacy Act, as applicable. However, the identity of sources who were given implied promises of confidentiality in inquiries conducted before September 27, 1975, also may be protected from disclosure.

(2) Ensure promises of confidentiality are not automatically given but are used sparingly. Establish appropriate procedures and identify fully categories of individuals who may make such promises. Promises of confidentiality shall be made only when they are essential to obtain the information sought (see 5 CFR part 736).
