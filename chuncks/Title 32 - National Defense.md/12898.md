####### ยง 719.144 Application for relief under 10 U.S.C. 869, in cases which have been finally reviewed.
######## Time limitations.

(b)In order to be considered by the Judge Advocate General, an application for relief must be placed in military channels if the applicant is on active duty, or be deposited in the mail if the applicant is no longer on active duty, on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. An application not filed in compliance with these time limits may be considered if the Judge Advocate General determines, in his or her sole discretion, that "good cause" for failure to file within the time limits has been established by the applicant.
