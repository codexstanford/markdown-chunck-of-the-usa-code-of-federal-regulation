###### ยง 45.11 Calculation of damages: offsets for DoD and VA Government compensation.
####### Payment and benefit programs.

(e)The listings in this section of certain programs that offset and do not offset potential medical malpractice damages awards are not all-inclusive and are subject to adjustment as necessary to account for compensation otherwise provided by DoD or VA for the same harm that resulted from the medical malpractice. Because compensation programs are often changed by Congress, Federal agencies, or judicial decisions, DoD will annually review relevant programs and take account of any such changes for purposes of applying the rules of this section to the adjudication of claims under this part.
