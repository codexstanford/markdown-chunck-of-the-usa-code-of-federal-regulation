####### Pre-Existing Medical Conditions.

(i)All evaluations of pre-existing medical conditions should be accomplished prior to deployment. Personnel who have pre-existing medical conditions may deploy if all of these conditions are met:

(1) The condition is not of such a nature that an unexpected worsening is likely to have a medically grave outcome or a negative impact on mission execution.

(2) The condition is stable and reasonably anticipated by the pre-deployment medical evaluator not to worsen during the deployment under contractor-provided medical care in-theater in light of the physical, physiological, psychological, environmental, and nutritional effects of the duties and location.
