(d) No such claim shall be paid unless it is presented within the period of one year from the date on which the expenses were incurred.

(e) No such claim shall be allowed in case it is determined that the cause of injury, illness, or death was due to negligence or misconduct of the registrant.

(f) Burial expenses shall not exceed the maximum prescribed in Section 11 of the Military Selective Service Act in any one case.

(g) Payment of such claims when allowed shall be made only:
