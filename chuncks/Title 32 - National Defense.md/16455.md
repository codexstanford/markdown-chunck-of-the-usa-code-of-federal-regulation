####### Mitigation or negation measures to address FOCI.

(f)(1) The CSA-approved mitigation or negation measures must assure that the entity can offset FOCI by effectively denying unauthorized people or entities access to classified information and preventing the foreign interest from adversely impacting the entity's performance on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information.

(2) Any mitigation or negation measures the CSA approves for an entity must not impede or interfere with the entity's ability to manage and comply with regulatory requirements imposed by other Federal agencies (such as Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulation).

(3) If the CSA approves a FOCI mitigation or negation measure for an entity, it may agree that the measure, or particular portions of it, may apply to all of the present and future sub-entities within the entity's organization.

(4) Mitigation or negation measures are different for ownership versus control or influence.

(5) Methods to mitigate foreign control or influence (unrelated to ownership) may include:

(i) Assigning specific oversight duties and responsibilities to independent board members;

(ii) Formulating special executive-level security committees to consider and oversee matters that affect entity performance on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information;

(iii) Modifying or terminating loan agreements, contracts, agreements, and other understandings with foreign interests;

(iv) Diversifying or reducing foreign-source income;

(v) Demonstrating financial viability independent of foreign interests;

(vi) Eliminating or resolving problem debt;

(vii) Separating, physically or organizationally, the entity component performing on contracts or agreements requiring access to classified information;

(viii) Adopting special board resolutions;

(ix) A combination of these methods, as determined by the CSA; or
