####### Content of the Study.

4.The document is a study of the environmental aspects of the proposed action to be considered in the decision-making process. The precise content of each study must be flexible because of such considerations as the sensitivity of obtaining information from foreign governments, the availability of useful and understandable information, and other factors identified under "Limitations," (subsection D.6., of this enclosure). The study should, however, include consideration of the following:

a. A general review of the affected environment;

b. The predicted effect of the action on the environment;

c. Significant known actions taken by governmental entities with respect to the proposed action to protect or improve the environment; and

d. If no actions are being taken to protect or enhance the environment, whether the decision not to do so was made by the affected foreign government or international organization.
