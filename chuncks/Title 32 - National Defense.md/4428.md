####### Environmental Reviews.,General.

E.1.Environmental reviews are the second of the two alternative types of documents to be used for actions covered by section B. of this enclosure.

a. An environmental review is a survey of the important environmental issues involved. It includes identification of these issues, and a review of what if any consideration has been or can be given to the environmental aspects by the United States and by any foreign government involved in taking the action.

b. An environmental review is prepared by the DoD component concerned either unilaterally or in conjunction with another Federal agency. While an environmental review may be used for any of the actions identified by section B., it may be uniquely suitable, because it is prepared unilaterally by the United States, to actions that affect the environment of a nation not involved in the undertaking (B.l.a.).
