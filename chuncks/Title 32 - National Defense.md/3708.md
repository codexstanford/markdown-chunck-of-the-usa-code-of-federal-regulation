The supplemental credentialing standards, in addition to the basic credentialing standards, must be used for CAC adjudication of individuals who are not also subject to the following types of adjudication:

(A) Eligibility to hold a sensitive position or for access to classified information,

(B) Suitability for Federal employment in the competitive service, or

(C) Qualification for Federal employment in the excepted service.
