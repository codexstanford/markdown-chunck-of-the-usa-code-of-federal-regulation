####### Ambulatory procedure visit.

An ambulatory procedure visit is a type of outpatient visit in which immediate (day of procedure) pre-procedure and immediate post-procedure care require an unusual degree of intensity and are provided in an ambulatory procedure unit (APU) of the facility of the Uniformed Services. Care is required in the facility for less than 24 hours. An APU is specially designated and is accounted for separately from any outpatient clinic.
