(2) Under the FOIA, an agency is to make an initial determination acknowledging and granting, partially granting, or denying a request for records within 20 working days after the agency receives a FOIA request (an agency may extend this period for "unusual circumstances";§ 10400.9). The FOIA Officer or designee will determine whether to grant the request and will provide written notification to the person making the request. The notification shall also advise the person making the request of any fees assessed under §§ 10400.11 through 10400.16. IPEC will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison.
