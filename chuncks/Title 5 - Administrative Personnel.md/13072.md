###### Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.

(d)The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

(1) IPEC determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, IPEC must give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
