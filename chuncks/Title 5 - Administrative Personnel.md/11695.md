#### ยง 3601.104 Additional limitations on gifts between employees.
##### Gifts from a group that includes a subordinate.

(a)Regardless of the number of employees contributing to a gift on a special, infrequent occasion as permitted by 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1), an employee may not accept a gift or gifts, including indirectly within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.203(f), from a donating group if the aggregate market value exceeds the minimal value, as established by 5 U.S.C. 7342(a)(5), and if the employee knows or has reason to know that any member of the donating group is a subordinate.

(1) The cost of items excluded from the definition of a gift by 5 CFR 2635.203(b) and the cost of food, refreshments, and entertainment provided to mark the occasion for which the gift is given shall not be included in determining whether the value of a gift or gifts exceeds the aggregate minimal value limit.

(2) The value of a gift or gifts from two or more donating groups will be aggregated and will be considered to be from a single donating group if the employee who is offered the gift knows or has reason to know that an individual who is his or her subordinate is a member of more than one of the donating groups.
