####### The relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974.

(b)The Freedom of Information Act applies to third-party requests for documents concerning the general activities of the government and of OGE in particular. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in a system of records as defined in the Privacy Act. When an individual requests access to his or her own records that are contained in an OGE system of records, the individual is making a Privacy Act request, not a FOIA request. Although OGE determines whether a request is a FOIA or Privacy Act request, OGE processes requests in accordance with both laws and will not deny access by a first party to a record under the FOIA or the Privacy Act if the record is available to that individual under both statutes. This provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding individuals' personal privacy.
