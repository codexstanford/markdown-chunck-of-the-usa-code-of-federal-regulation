###### ยง 9701.342 Performance pay increases.
####### Adjustments for employees returning after performing honorable service in the uniformed services.

(f)DHS will issue implementing directives regarding how it sets the rate of basic pay prospectively for an employee who leaves a DHS position to perform service in the uniformed services (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303 and 5 CFR 353.102) and returns through the exercise of a reemployment right provided by law, Executive order, or regulation under which accrual of service for seniority-related benefits is protected (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 4316). DHS will credit the employee with intervening rate range adjustments under ยง 9701.323(a), as well as developmental pay adjustments under ยง 9701.345 (as determined by DHS in accordance with its implementing directives), and performance pay adjustments under this section based on the employee's last DHS rating of record. For employees who have no such rating of record, DHS will use the modal rating received by other employees covered by the same pay pool during the most recent rating cycle. An employee returning from qualifying service in the uniformed services will receive the full amount of the performance pay increase associated with his or her rating of record.
