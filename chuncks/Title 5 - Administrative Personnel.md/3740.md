####### Refund for home leave.

(e)An employee is indebted for the home leave used by him when he fails to return to service abroad after the period of home leave, or after the completion of an assignment in the United States. However, a refund for this indebtedness is not required when (1) the employee has completed not less than 6 months' service in an assignment in the United States following the period of home leave; (2) the agency determines that the employee's failure to return was due to compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature, such as may involve physical or mental health or circumstances over which the employee has no control; or (3) the agency which granted the home leave determines that it is in the public interest not to return the employee to his overseas assignment.
