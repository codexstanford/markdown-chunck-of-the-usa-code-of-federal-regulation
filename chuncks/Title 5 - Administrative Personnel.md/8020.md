(i) The information is less than 10 years old; or

(ii) The Board has reason to believe that releasing the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

(2) With respect to confidential commercial information received by the Board on or after January 1, 1988, the Board will give notice to the business submitter whenever:

(i) The business submitter has designated the information in good faith as commercially or financially sensitive information; or

(ii) The Board has reason to believe that releasing the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

(3) Notice of a request for commercially confidential information that was received by January 1, 1988, is required for a period of not more than 10 years after the date on which the information is submitted unless the business submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer specific notice period. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentially must be supported by a statement or certification, by an officer or authorized representative of the company, that the information in question is confidential commercial information and has not been disclosed to the public.
