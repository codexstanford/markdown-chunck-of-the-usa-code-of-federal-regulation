####### Limitation on exception for service as an expert witness.

(2)The exception described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not negate the bar of 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(1), or ยง 2641.201, to a former employee serving as an expert witness; where the bar of section 207(a)(1) applies, a former employee may not serve as an expert witness except:

(i) If he is called as a witness by the United States; or

(ii) By court order. For this purpose, a subpoena is not a court order, nor is an order merely qualifying an individual to testify as an expert witness.
