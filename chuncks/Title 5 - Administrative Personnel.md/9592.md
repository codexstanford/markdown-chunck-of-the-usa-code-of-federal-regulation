##### ยง 2411.6 Identification of information requested.
###### Referral.

(2)(i) When the Authority, the General Counsel, the Panel, or the IG believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Authority, the General Counsel, the Panel, or the IG will typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency or component. Ordinarily, the agency or component that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency or component to make the disclosure determination. However, if the FLRA and the originating agency or component jointly agree that the FLRA is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever the Authority, the General Counsel, the Panel, or the IG refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another Federal agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
