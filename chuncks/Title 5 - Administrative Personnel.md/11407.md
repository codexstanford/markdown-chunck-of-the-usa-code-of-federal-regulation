###### ยง 2641.204 One-year restriction on any former senior employee's representations to former agency concerning any matter, regardless of prior involvement.
####### Commencement and length of restriction.

(d)18 U.S.C. 207(c) is a one-year restriction. The one-year period is measured from the date when the employee ceases to serve in a senior employee position, not from the termination of Government service, unless the two events occur simultaneously. (In the case of a Reserve officer of the Armed Forces or an officer of the National Guard who is a special Government employee serving in a senior employee position, section 207(c) is measured from the date when the officer terminates a period of active duty or active duty for training.)
