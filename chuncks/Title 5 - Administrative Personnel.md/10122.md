###### ยง 2424.30 Procedure through which the petition for review will be resolved.
####### A bargaining obligation dispute exists.

(2)Where a bargaining obligation dispute exists in addition to the negotiability dispute, the Authority will inform the exclusive representative of any opportunity to file an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure and, where the exclusive representative pursues either of these courses, proceed in accord with paragraph (a) of this section. If the exclusive representative does not file an unfair labor practice charge or grievance, the Authority will proceed to resolve all disputes necessary for disposition of the petition unless, in its discretion, the Authority determines that resolving all disputes is not appropriate because, for example, resolution of the bargaining obligation dispute under this part would unduly delay resolution of the negotiability dispute, or the procedures in another, available administrative forum are better suited to resolve the bargaining obligation dispute.
