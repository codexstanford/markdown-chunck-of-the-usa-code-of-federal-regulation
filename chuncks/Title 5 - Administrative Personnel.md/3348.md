###### ยง 575.309 Payment of retention incentives.
####### i.e.

(d) A retention incentive payment paid as a single lump-sum payment upon completion of the full service period required by the service agreement is derived by multiplying the retention incentive percentage rate established under paragraph (a) of this section by the total basic pay the employee earned during the full service period. For example, an agency establishes a retention incentive percentage rate of 10 percent for an employee. The employee has a service agreement that provides for a single lump-sum retention incentive payment after completion of the full service period required by the service agreement (, 26 pay periods). The employee earns $65,000 during the 26 pay periods of service ($2,500 biweekly rate of basic pay x 26). Upon completion of the full service period, the employee will receive a single lump-sum retention incentive payment of $6,500 ($65,000 x .10).
