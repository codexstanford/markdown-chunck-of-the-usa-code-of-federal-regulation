(a)The factors OPM shall consider in deciding whether to propose a provider's debarment under a permissive debarment authority are:

(1) The nature of any claims involved in the basis for the proposed debarment and the circumstances under which they were presented to FEHBP carriers;

(2) The improper conduct involved in the basis for the proposed debarment, and the provider's degree of culpability and history of prior offenses;

(3) The extent to which the provider poses or may pose a risk to the health and safety of FEHBP-covered individuals or to the integrity of FEHBP transactions; and

(4) Other factors specifically relevant to the provider's debarment that shall be considered in the interests of fairness.
