(b)For the purposes of determining entitlement to annuity based on such involuntary separation, the offer of a position must meet all of the following conditions to be considered a reasonable offer:

(1) The offer must be made in writing;

(2) The employee must meet established qualification requirements; and

(3) The offered position must be-

(i) In the employee's agency, including an agency to which the employee with his or her function is transferred in a transfer of functions between agencies;

(ii) Within the employee's commuting area as defined in ยง 831.1202 of this part, unless geographic mobility is a condition of the employee's employment;

(iii) Of the same tenure and work schedule; and

(iv) Not lower than the equivalent of two grades or pay levels below the employee's current grade or pay level, without consideration of the employee's eligibility to retain his or her current grade or pay under part 536 of this chapter or other authority. In movements between pay schedules or pay systems, the comparison rate of the grade or pay level that is two grades below that of the current position will be compared with the comparison rate of the grade or pay level of the offered position.
