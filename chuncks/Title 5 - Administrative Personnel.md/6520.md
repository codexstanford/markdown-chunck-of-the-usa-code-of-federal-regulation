###### ยง 890.303 Continuation of enrollment.
####### In nonpay status.

(e)(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the enrollment of an employee continues while he/she is in nonpay status for up to 365 days. The 365 days' nonpay status may be continuous or broken by periods of less than 4 consecutive months in pay status. If an employee has at least 4 consecutive months in pay status after a period of nonpay status he/she is entitled to begin the 365 days' continuation of enrollment anew. For the purposes of this paragraph, 4 consecutive months in pay status means any 4-month period during which the employee is in pay status for at least part of each pay period.

(2) However, in the case of an employee who is employed under an OPM approved career-related work-study program under Schedule D of at least one year's duration and who is expected to be in a pay status during not less than one-third of the total period of time from the date of the first appointment to the completion of the work-study program, his/her enrollment continues while he/she is in nonpay status so long as he/she is participating in the work-study program.

(f) [Reserved]
