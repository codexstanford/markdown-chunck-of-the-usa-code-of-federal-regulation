### PART 3601 - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
#### ยง 3601.102 Designation of DoD components as separate agencies for purposes of gifts from outside sources, and teaching, speaking, and writing.
##### Example 1 to paragraph (a).

For paragraph (a)(1) of this section [Teaching, Speaking, or Writing]: An Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) employee is asked to give a compensated speech on prisoners of war, a topic on which he has a personal interest. While the Department of Defense has ongoing policies, programs, or operations related to this topic, the ASBCA does not. The employee may give the speech in a personal capacity and receive compensation because the ASBCA is a designated separate agency, the speech is not related to an ongoing program or operation of the ASBCA, and the speech is not otherwise related to the employee's official duties.
