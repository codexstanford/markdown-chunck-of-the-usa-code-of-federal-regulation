(4) The annuity reduction under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is equal to the lesser of-

(i) The amount of the deposit under § 842.611 or § 842.612 divided by the present value factor for the retiree's age on the commencing date of the reduction under paragraph (b)(3) of this section (plus any previous reduction(s) in the retiree's annuity required under paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section); or
