###### Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 838 - Recommended Language for Court Orders Dividing Employee Annuities

This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders attempting to divide employee annuity. A court order directed at employee annuity should include five elements:

- Identification of the benefits;

- Instructions that OPM pay the former spouse;

- A method for computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit;

- Identification of the type of annuity to which to apply a fraction, percentage or formula; and

- Instructions on what OPM should do if the employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a refund of employee contributions.

The court order may also include instructions for disposition of the former spouse's share if the former spouse dies before the employee. By using the model language, courts will know that the court order will have the effect described in this appendix.

The model language in this appendix does not award a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a former spouse survivor annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. Appendix A to subpart I of this part contains model language for awarding survivor annuities and contains some examples that award both a portion of an employee annuity and a survivor annuity.

The model language uses the terms "[former spouse]" to identify the spouse who is receiving a former spouse's portion of an employee annuity and "[employee]" to identify the Federal employee whose employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the appropriate terms, such as "Petitioner" and "Respondent," or the names of the parties should replace "[former spouse]" and "[employee]."

Similarly, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System. The name of the retirement system should be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.

Using the following paragraph will expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part. A court order directed at employee annuity (or awarding a survivor annuity) that is labelled a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" or is issued on an ERISA form will not be automatically rendered unacceptable under § 838.302(a) or § 838.803(a) if the court order contains the following paragraph.

"The court has considered the requirements and standard terminology provided in part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The terminology used in the provisions of this order that concern benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System are governed by the standard conventions established in that part."

Using the following paragraph will expressly divide employee annuity to satisfy the requirements of § 838.303 and direct OPM to pay the former spouse a share of an employee annuity to satisfy the requirements of § 838.304.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Insert language for computing the former spouse's share from 200 series of this appendix.] The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will protect the former spouse interest in military retired pay in the event that the employee waives the military retired pay to allow crediting the military service under CSRS or FERS. The paragraph should be used only if the former spouse is awarded a portion of the military retired pay. "If [Employee] waives military retired pay to credit military service under the Civil Service Retirement System, [insert language for computing the former spouse's share from 200 series of this appendix]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Paragraphs 201 through 204 contain model language for the most common types of wards that court orders make to former spouses. Subsequent paragraphs in the 200 series contain model language for less common, more complex awards.

Awards other than fixed amounts require that the court order specify the type of annuity ("gross," "net," or self-only) on which the award is computed. The types of annuity are defined in § 838.103. Variations on type of annuity are covered by the 300 series of this appendix.

Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a fixed monthly amount. OPM will not apply COLA's to a fixed monthly amount unless the court order expressly directs that OPM and COLA's using the language in &#xB6; 231 of this appendix or similar language.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated percentage of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert a number] percent of [employee]'s [insert "gross," "net," or "self-only"] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated fraction of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert fraction]ths of [employee]'s [insert "gross," "net," or "self-only"] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity. Prorata share is defined in § 838.621. To award a prorata share the court order must state the date of the marriage. Unless the court order specifies a different ending date, the marriage ends for computation purposes on the date that the court order is filed with the court clerk. Unless the court order expressly directs that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert 'gross,' 'net,' or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraphs will award the former spouse a share of the employee annuity based on a formula stated in the court order. The formula must be stated in the court order (including a court-approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court order must include any data that is necessary for OPM to apply the formula unless the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a share of [employee]'s [insert 'gross,' 'net,' or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System to be computed as follows: [Insert formula for computing the former spouse's share.]"

"The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

A court order may include an award directed at (1) phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status; (2) composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status and then enter full retirement status; or (3) annuity payable to an employee who retires without having elected phased retirement status.
