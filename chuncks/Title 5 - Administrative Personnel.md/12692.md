####### Duty status during notice period.

(c)An employee will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the notice period. However, when the Department determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the Department may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:

(1) Assign the employee to duties where the Department determines the employee is no longer a threat to safety, the Department's mission, or Government property;

(2) Allow the employee to take leave, or place him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay) or absence without leave if the employee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without approved leave; or

(3) Place the employee in a paid, non-duty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action.
