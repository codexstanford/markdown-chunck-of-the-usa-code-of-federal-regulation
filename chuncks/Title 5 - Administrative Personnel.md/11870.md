#### ยง 5301.102 Participation in proposals and awards.
##### Reporting involvement of prospective, current, or recent employees.

(b)(1) When an employee who is participating in a proposal or award becomes aware that a prospective, current, or recent NSF employee or current National Science Board member is or is likely to become a member of the research group or project staff under that proposal or award, the employee shall bring that circumstance to the attention of an agency designee. For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) A "recent NSF employee" is any former NSF employee who left the NSF within the year before submission of the proposal at issue or on which the award was based.

(ii) A "prospective NSF employee" is any person being recruited by an NSF official for a specific opening and from whom the official has received an indication of mutual interest. Such a person is a "prospective NSF employee" even though those recruiting have not extended an offer and even though the person might not accept an offer if it were extended.

(2) The agency designee shall review the circumstances to determine what action, if any, should be taken to assure that the proposal or award is administered impartially and otherwise in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including this part, 5 CFR part 2635, 18 U.S.C. 207 and 208, and 45 CFR part 680.
