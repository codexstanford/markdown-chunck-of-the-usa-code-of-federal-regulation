(a) OGE will maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format a current index of the materials available on its Web site that are required to be indexed under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2).

(b) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics has determined that it is unnecessary and impracticable to publish quarterly or more frequently and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index and supplements thereto, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). The Office will provide copies of such indexes upon request, at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication and mailing, if sending records by other than ordinary mail.
