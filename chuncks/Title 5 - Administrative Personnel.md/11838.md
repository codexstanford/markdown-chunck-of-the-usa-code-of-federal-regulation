#### ยง 5001.102 Prohibited financial interests in for-hire transportation companies.
##### Exceptions.

(c)(1) Where a previously proper holding of a member or other employee becomes prohibited because of the enterprise's acquisition of an interest in a for-hire transportation company, the employee shall have nine months within which to dispose of the interest.

(2) In cases of financial hardship where the relationship or interest is not prohibited by 49 U.S.C. 10301(d) or 10306(e), the Designated Agency Ethics Official may grant a written waiver of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section based on a determination that application of the prohibition is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the Commission's programs are administered or to avoid a violation of part 2635 of this title.
