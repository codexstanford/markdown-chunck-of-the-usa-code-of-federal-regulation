####### Negotiability dispute

(c)means a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning the legality of a proposal or provision. A negotiability dispute exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency contention that (without regard to any bargaining obligation dispute) a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, including disagreement with an agency contention that a proposal is bargainable only at its election. A negotiability dispute also exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency head's disapproval of a provision as contrary to law. A negotiability dispute may exist where there is no bargaining obligation dispute. Examples of negotiability disputes include disagreements between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether a proposal or provision:

(1) Affects a management right under 5 U.S.C. 7106(a);

(2) Constitutes a procedure or appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(2) and (3), respectively; and

(3) Is consistent with a Government-wide regulation.
