##### Community relations events.

(a)(1) An employee may accept an unsolicited gift of free attendance for himself or herself and a guest at a community relations event sponsored by a State or local government, or by a civic organization exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(4), when:

(i) The cost of free attendance is provided by the sponsor of the event; and

(ii) The employee's agency designee determines that the community relations interests of the agency will be served by the employee's attendance in his or her personal capacity, and the employee's attendance outweighs any concern that acceptance would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the employee's integrity or impartiality.

(2) Refer to 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(5) in determining whether the cost of attendance may be considered to be provided by the sponsor of the event.
