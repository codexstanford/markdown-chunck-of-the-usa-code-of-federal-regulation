####### Deposit for service is not necessary.

(c)It is not necessary for an individual to make a deposit for service performed with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality to receive credit for such service. However, if the individual does not elect to make a deposit, his or her annuity is reduced by 10 percent of the amount that should have been deposited for the period of service (including any interest) as specified by sections 8334(e) (2) and (3) of title 5, United States Code. When an employee elects an alternative annuity and also elects to make the deposit, OPM will deem the deposit to be made for purposes of computing the alternative annuity.
