(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the time limit for making an election under subpart D of this part is August 11, 1997.

(b) Because Public Law 104-106 requires that eligible employees receive timely notice of the opportunity to make the election under subpart D of this part, and that employees must be counseled concerning the election opportunity, the employing agency must waive the time limit in paragraph (a) of this section in the event that an employee did not receive such notice or counselling.
