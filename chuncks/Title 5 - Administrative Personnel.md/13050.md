#### Subpart A - Freedom of Information Act Policies and Procedures
##### ยง 10400.8 Expedited and multi-track processing, and aggregation of requests for processing.
###### Aggregating requests.

(c)IPEC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, involve related matters and constitute a single request that otherwise would involve "unusual circumstances" under ยง 10400.9. For example, IPEC may aggregate multiple requests for similar information filed by a single requester within a short period of time. In addition, as discussed in ยง 10400.16, IPEC may aggregate requests for fee purposes.
