####### Erroneous FERS coverage for a period of less than 3 years of service.

(2)(i)For an employee, separated employee, or retiree whose employing agency erroneously determined that the individual was covered by FERS during the period under ยง 846.201 when the individual was eligible to elect FERS, and the employing agency should have placed the individual in CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-Only, under conditions that would have included an opportunity to elect FERS coverage, and the employee, separated employee, or retiree remained in FERS for less than 3 years of service, the employee, separated employee, or retiree is deemed to have elected FERS coverage and the individual will remain covered by FERS, unless the individual declines under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be covered by FERS.

(ii)(A) The employing agency must provide written notice to each individual who is deemed to have elected FERS under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that the individual may, within 60 days after receiving the notice, decline to be deemed to have transferred to FERS.

(B) If the individual dies during the election period established by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (C) of this section, the right of election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may be exercised by any person who would be entitled to receive a current spouse survivor annuity or a former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS (or CSRS Offset), if any, if the error had not occurred (the election by any one such current or former spouse not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is controlling); otherwise, by the individual or individuals entitled to receive the lump-sum credit under CSRS (or CSRS Offset) if the error had not occurred (the election by any individual entitled to a share of the lump-sum credit not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is controlling). The time limit for making an election under this paragraph is 60 days after the date of the agency's notice to the individual (survivor) of the election right.

(C) The agency may waive the 60-day time limit under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section if the individual (if living, otherwise the appropriate survivor) exercised due diligence in making the election but was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the election within the time limit. An agency decision not to waive the time limit under this paragraph must include notice to the individual of the individual's right to request OPM to reconsider the denial of the waiver of the time limit. OPM's reconsideration decision on denial of a waiver of the time limit will notify the individual of the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under chapter II of this title.

(iii) The employing agency must document the individual's records to reflect his or her decision concerning retirement coverage.
