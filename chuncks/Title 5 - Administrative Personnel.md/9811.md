### Subchapter B - General Provisions
#### PART 2418 - FLRA DEBT COLLECTION
##### Subpart C - Procedures for Offset of FLRA Payments to Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
###### § 2418.19 How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by the FLRA?
####### Offset of FLRA payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.

(a)(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by the FLRA and other Federal agencies, a process known as "centralized offset." When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask the FLRA (when acting as a "payment agency") to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the FLRA, including salary payments issued to FLRA employees. This section and § 2418.20 apply when a Federal agency asks the FLRA to offset a payment issued by the FLRA to a person who owes a debt to the United States.

(2) This subpart does not apply to FLRA debts. See §§ 2418.10 through 2418.12 for offset procedures applicable to FLRA debts.

(3) This subpart does not apply to the collection of non-FLRA debts through tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.2 for tax-refund-offset procedures.
