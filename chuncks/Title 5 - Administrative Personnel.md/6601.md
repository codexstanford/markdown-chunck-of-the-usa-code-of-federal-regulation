###### ยง 890.806 When can former spouses change enrollment or reenroll and what are the effective dates?
####### Annuity insufficient to pay withholdings.

(m)(1) If the annuity of a former spouse is insufficient to pay the full subscription charge for the plan in which he or she is enrolled, the retirement system must provide the former spouse with information regarding the available plans and written notification of the opportunity to either-

(i) Pay the premium directly to the retirement system in accordance with ยง 890.808(d); or

(ii) Enroll in any plan with a full premium that is less than the amount of annuity. If the former spouse elects to change to a lower cost enrollment, the change takes effect immediately upon loss of coverage under the prior enrollment.

(2) If the former spouse is enrolled in the high option of a plan that has two options, and does not elect a plan with a full premium that is less than the annuity or does not elect to pay premiums directly, he or she is deemed to have enrolled in the standard option of the same plan unless the annuity is insufficient to pay the full subscription charge for the standard option.

(3) A former spouse who is enrolled in a plan with only one option, who fails to make the election required by this paragraph (m)(3) will be subject to the provisions of ยง 890.807(c).
