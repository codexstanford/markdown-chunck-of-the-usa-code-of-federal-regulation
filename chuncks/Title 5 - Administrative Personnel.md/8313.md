###### Exceptions.

(vii)Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceedings. The mere fact that records in a system of records are frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not intended to preclude access by an individual to records which are available to that individual under other processes such as the Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.
