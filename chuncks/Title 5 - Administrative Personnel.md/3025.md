###### Assignment of Regular Tour of Duty and Overtime Supplement
####### ยง 550.1612 Assignments made at other times.
######## Inability determination and effective date of tour change.

(e)The action to assign a Basic regular tour of duty based on a determination that an agent is unable to perform overtime on a daily basis under ยง 550.1611(f)(2) is subject to the following rules:

(1) The inability determination may be made-

(i) When an agent's law enforcement authority is revoked (e.g., in connection with an investigation, loss of security clearance, or a suspension);

(ii) When an agent is unable to perform overtime duties for an extended period due to physical or health reasons; or

(iii) For any other appropriate reason, as determined by CBP, but excluding inability based on lack of work (as opposed to inability based on the employee's availability).

(2) The change to a Basic regular tour of duty is effective on the next workday following a CBP inability determination, except that-

(i) CBP may delay the effective date to coincide with the beginning of a week or a biweekly pay period;

(ii) CBP may delay the effective date as necessary to allow an agent who is able to work during regular time to exhaust a positive balance of unused compensatory time off (by applying that balance against the newly accruing overtime hours debt resulting from work during regular time);

(iii) CBP may delay the effective date as necessary to allow an agent to use accrued paid leave or other paid time off if the agent will be performing no work during regular time for a continuous period;

(iv) CBP may delay the effective date during a continuous period of leave without pay granted under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V (dealing with family and medical leave); and

(v) CBP must delay the effective date during any period of paid leave, continuation of pay, or leave without pay granted in connection with application of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81 (dealing with workers' compensation due to a job-related injury).
