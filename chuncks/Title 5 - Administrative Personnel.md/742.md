###### ยง 302.302 Examination of applicants.
####### Rating.

(b)Numerical scores will be assigned on a scale of 100. Each applicant who meets the qualification requirements for the position established under ยง 302.202 will be assigned a rating of 70 or more and will be eligible for appointment. Candidates scoring 70 or more will receive additional points for veteran preference as provided in ยง 302.201. Numerical ratings are not required when all qualified applicants will be offered immediate appointment. When there is an excessive number of applicants, numerical ratings are required only for a sufficient number of the highest qualified applicants to meet the anticipated needs of the agency within a reasonable period of time. The agency must, however, adopt procedures to insure the consideration of preference eligibles in the order in which they would have been considered if all applicants had been assigned numerical ratings. An agency shall furnish a notice of the rating assigned to an applicant on his/her request.
