####### Employee's right to reemployment.

(a)An employee is entitled to be reemployed by the reemploying agency as promptly as possible but not more than 30 calendar days after receipt of his application. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the employee is entitled to reemployment in the occupational field and at the same grade or level and in the same geographical area as the position which the employee last held in that agency. If the reemployment would cause the separation or demotion of another employee, the applicant shall then be considered an employee for the purpose of applying the reduction-in-force regulations (5 CFR part 351) to determine to what, if any, position, he or she is entitled.
