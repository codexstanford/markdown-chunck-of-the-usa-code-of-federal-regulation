####### Agency plan for setting and adjusting SES rate of basic pay.

(g)Each agency must establish a plan for setting and adjusting the rates of basic pay for SES members. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions, while assuring confidentiality. In developing its plan for setting and adjusting SES rates, an agency may consider the senior executive's broad scope of authority and level of responsibility and his or her personal accountability for the success (or failure) of an agency's programs. The agency's plan must require that any decisions to adjust pay must reflect meaningful distinctions among senior executives based on individual performance and/or contribution to agency performance and must include-

(1) The criteria that will be used to set and adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay to ensure that individual pay rates or pay adjustments, as well as their overall distribution within the SES rate range, reflect meaningful distinctions within a single performance rating level (e.g., the higher the employee's relative performance within a rating level, the higher the pay adjustment) and/or between performance rating levels (e.g., the higher the rating level, the higher the pay adjustment);

(2) The criteria that will be used to set and adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay at a rate that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if the applicable agency performance appraisal system has been certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D;

(3) The designation of the authorized agency official who has authority to set and adjust SES rates of pay for individual senior executives, subject to the requirement that the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) and (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) must approve any determination to set a senior executive's rate of basic pay higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule and must approve any determination to increase a senior executive's rate of basic pay more than once in any 12-month period; and

(4) The administrative and management controls that will be applied to ensure compliance with applicable statutes, OPM's regulations, the agency's plan, and, where applicable, the certification requirements set forth in 5 CFR 430, subpart D, and the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in ยง 534.403(a).
