####### F. Computation limited to a particular period of employment.

In order to limit the computation of benefits to a particular period of employment, the court order must use language expressly limiting the period of service to be included in the computation. General language such as "benefits accrued as a result of employment with the U.S. Postal Service * * *" will be interpreted to mean only that CSRS retirement benefits are subject to division (see V.A. of appendix A to subpart J of part 838). Such language will not be interpreted to limit the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service performed with other Government agencies will be included). To limit the period of service, the court order should specify the number of months to be included in the computation or should describe specifically the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., "only U.S. Postal Service" or "exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal Service employment" or "only service performed during the period Petitioner and Defendant were married" or "benefits based on service performed through the date of divorce," etc.).
