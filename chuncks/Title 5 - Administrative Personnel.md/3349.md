####### i.e.

(e)(1) An authorized agency official may request that OPM waive the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section and permit the agency to pay an individual employee or group of employees a retention incentive of up to 50 percent of the employee's basic pay based on a critical agency need. In addition to the determination required by § 575.308, the authorized agency official must determine that the employee's (or group of employees') unusually high or unique qualifications (, competencies) are critical to the successful accomplishment of an important agency mission, project, or initiative (e.g., programs or projects related to a national emergency or implementing a new law or critical management initiative).

(2) Waiver requests must include-

(i) A description of the employee's work requirements and responsibilities or, if requesting a group retention incentive, a description of the group or category of employees and the number of employees to be covered by the proposed retention incentive;

(ii) A description of the critical agency need the proposed retention incentive would address;

(iii) The written documentation required by § 575.308;

(iv) The proposed retention incentive percentage rate and a justification for that percentage;

(v) The timing and method of making the retention incentive payments;

(vi) The service period required; and

(vii) Any other information pertinent to the case at hand.

(3) OPM may require that waiver requests for groups or categories of employees be coordinated with other agencies having similarly situated employees in the same category.

(4) Notwithstanding § 575.310(f), an authorized agency official must require a signed written service agreement for any employee who may receive a higher retention incentive as a result of approval of a waiver of the maximum limit on the amount of a retention incentive under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(f) An agency may not offer or authorize a retention incentive for an individual prior to employment with the agency.

(g) An agency may not commence a group or individual retention incentive service agreement or provide a group or individual retention incentive without a service agreement under § 575.310(f) for any biweekly pay period during-

(1) A period of employment established under any service agreement required for the payment of a recruitment incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart A, or a relocation incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart B, (see 5 CFR 575.205(e) regarding the authority to commence a relocation incentive service agreement during a period of employment established under a service agreement for a previously authorized retention incentive or for which an employee is receiving previously authorized retention incentive payments without a service agreement); or

(2) A period of employment established under a service agreement for a previously authorized retention incentive or for which an employee is receiving a previously authorized retention incentive without a service agreement under § 575.310(f) (including a group retention incentive with or without a service agreement).

(h) A retention incentive is not part of an employee's rate of basic pay for any purpose.

(i) Payment of a retention incentive is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B.
