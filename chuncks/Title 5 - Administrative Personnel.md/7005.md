###### ยง 892.211 What options are available to me if I go on a period of leave without pay (LWOP) or other types of non-pay status?
####### Catch-up.

(4)Under the catch-up option, you must agree in advance of the LWOP period that: you will continue FEHB coverage while on LWOP; your employer will advance your share of your FEHB premium during your LWOP period; and you will repay the advanced amounts when you return from LWOP. (Described in ยง 890.502(b) of this chapter.) Your catch-up contributions may be made through premium conversion.

(5) If you remain in FEHB upon your return from LWOP, your catch-up premiums and current premiums will be paid at the same time.

(c) Your return from LWOP constitutes a qualifying life event as described in ยง 892.101. You may change your premium conversion election (waive if you now participate, or participate if you now waive). The election you choose upon return from LWOP will apply to your current as well as your catch-up premiums.
