###### Limit.

(b)There is no limit on the number of investment election requests. A participant may make a total of two unrestricted fund reallocations and/or fund transfers per account (e.g., civilian or uniformed services), per calendar month. A fund reallocation or fund transfer will count toward the monthly total on the date posted by the TSP record keeper and not on the date requested by a participant. After a participant has made a total of two fund reallocations and/or fund transfers in a calendar month, the participant may make additional fund reallocations or fund transfers only into the G Fund until the first day of the next calendar month.
