####### Requirements for issuing an individual waiver under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(3).

(a)Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(3), an agency may determine in an individual case that the prohibition of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) should not apply to a special Government employee serving on, or an individual being considered for, appointment to an advisory committee established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, notwithstanding the fact that the individual has one or more financial interests that would be affected by the activities of the advisory committee. The agency's determination must be based on a certification that the need for the employee's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved. Waivers issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(3) should comply with the following requirements:

(1) The advisory committee upon which the individual is serving, or will serve, is an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app.;

(2) The waiver must be issued in writing by the Government official responsible for the individual's appointment (or other Government official to which authority to issue such waivers has been delegated) after the official reviews the financial disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978;

(3) The waiver must include a certification that the need for the individual's services on the advisory committee outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest;

(4) The facts upon which the certification is based should be fully described in the waiver, including the nature of the financial interest, and the particular matter or matters to which the waiver applies;

(5) The waiver should describe any limitations on the individual's ability to act in the matter or matters;

(6) The waiver must be issued prior to the individual taking any action in the matter or matters; and

(7) The waiver may apply to both present and future financial interests of the individual, provided the interests are described with sufficient specificity.
