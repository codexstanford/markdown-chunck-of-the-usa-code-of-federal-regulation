###### Finality of HSLRB decisions.

(g)Decisions of the HSLRB are final and binding. However, in cases involving unfair labor practices and/or negotiability disputes decided by a single member, a party may seek review of that decision with the full HSLRB, according to rules prescribed by the HSLRB. In such cases the initial decision is stayed pending the final decision by the full HSLRB.
