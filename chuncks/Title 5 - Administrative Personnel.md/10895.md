This subpart contains two provisions relating to financial interests. One is a disqualification requirement and the other is a prohibition on acquiring or continuing to hold specific financial interests. An employee may acquire or hold any financial interest not prohibited by ยง 2635.403. Notwithstanding that his acquisition or holding of a particular interest is proper, an employee is prohibited in accordance with ยง 2635.402 of this subpart from participating in an official capacity in any particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he or any person whose interests are imputed to him has a financial interest, if the particular matter will have a direct and predictable effect on that interest. See also part 2640 of this chapter, for additional guidance amplifying ยง 2635.402.
