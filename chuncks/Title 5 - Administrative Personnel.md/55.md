##### ยง 120.3 Requirements for clearance.

Except as described in ยง 120.6(c), the Director of OPM may delegate any function related to the review and clearance of guidance. OPM's review and clearance of guidance shall ensure that each guidance document proposed to be issued by OPM satisfies the following requirements:

(a) The guidance document complies with all relevant statutes and regulation (including any statutory deadlines for agency action);

(b) The guidance document identifies or includes:

(1) The term "guidance" or its functional equivalent;

(2) The issuing office name;

(3) A unique identifier, including, at a minimum, the date of issuance, title of the document, and its regulatory identification number (Z-RIN) in the case of a significant guidance document;

(4) The general topic, activity, persons, and/or entities to which the guidance applies;

(5) Citations to applicable statutes and regulations;

(6) A statement noting whether the guidance is intended to revise or replace any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and

(7) A concise summary of the guidance document's content;

(c) The guidance document avoids using mandatory language, such as "shall," "must," "required," or "requirement," unless it is binding guidance by law or as incorporated in a contract, the language is describing an established statutory or regulatory requirement, or the language is addressed to agency staff or other Federal employees and will not foreclose OPM's ability to consider positions advanced by any affected private parties;

(d) The guidance document is written in plain and understandable English; and

(e) The guidance document includes the following disclaimer prominently: "The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies." When a guidance document is binding because binding guidance is authorized by law or because the guidance is incorporated into a contract, the originating office should modify this disclaimer to reflect either of those facts.
