### PART 1645 - CALCULATION OF SHARE PRICES
#### ยง 1645.5 Calculation of share prices.
##### Calculation of share price.

(a)The share price for each TSP core fund for each business day will apply to all sources of contributions for that fund. The total net earnings (as computed under ยง 1645.3) for each fund will be divided by the total fund basis (as computed under ยง 1645.6) for that fund. The resulting number, computed to ten decimal places, represents the incremental change in the value of that fund from the last business day to the current business day. The share price for that fund for the current business day is the sum of the incremental change in the share price for the current business day plus the share price for the prior business day, truncated to four decimal places.
