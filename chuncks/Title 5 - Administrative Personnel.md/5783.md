###### ยง 843.410 Annuity for a child age 18 to 22 during full-time school attendance.
####### Continuation of annuity during interim breaks.

(d)A child's annuity continues during interim breaks between school years if the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the school term immediately before the break.

(2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 months. (See ยง 841.109 of this chapter, concerning calculation of this time period.)

(3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the student has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the period term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to school.
