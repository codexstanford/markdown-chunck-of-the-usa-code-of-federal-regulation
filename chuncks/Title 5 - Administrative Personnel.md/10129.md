###### ยง 2424.40 Authority decision and order.
####### Cases involving proposals.

(b)If the Authority finds that the duty to bargain extends to the proposal, or any severable part of the proposal, then the Authority will order the agency to bargain on request concerning the proposal. If the Authority finds that the duty to bargain does not extend to the proposal, then the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. If the Authority finds that the proposal is bargainable only at the election of the agency, then the Authority will so state. If the Authority resolves a negotiability dispute by finding that a proposal is within the duty to bargain, but there are unresolved bargaining obligation dispute claims, then the Authority will order the agency to bargain on request in the event its bargaining obligation claims are resolved in a manner that requires bargaining.
