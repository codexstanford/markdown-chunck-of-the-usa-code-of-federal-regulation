####### Delay in determination.

(c)(1) An acceptable level of competence determination shall be delayed when, and only when, either of the following applies:

(i) An employee has not had the minimum period of time established at ยง 430.207(a) of this chapter to demonstrate acceptable performance because he or she has not been informed of the specific requirements for performance at an acceptable level of competence in his or her current position, and the employee has not been given a performance rating in any position within the minimum period of time (as established at ยง 430.207(a) of this chapter) before the end of the waiting period; or

(ii) An employee is reduced in grade because of unacceptable performance to a position in which he or she is eligible for a within-grade increase or will become eligible within the minimum period as established at ยง 430.207(a) of this chapter.

(2) When an acceptable level of competence determination has been delayed under this subpart:

(i) The employee shall be informed that his or her determination is postponed and the appraisal period extended and shall be told of the specific requirements for performance at an acceptable level of competence.

(ii) An acceptable level of competence determination shall then be made based on the employee's rating of record completed at the end of the extended appraisal period.

(iii) If, following the delay, the employee's performance is determined to be at an acceptable level of competence, the within-grade increase will be granted retroactively to the beginning of the pay period following completion of the applicable waiting period.
