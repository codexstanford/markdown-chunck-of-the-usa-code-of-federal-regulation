(iii) An opportunity to be represented in the matter by an attorney or other representative;

(iv) A written decision and specific reasons for the pay reduction at the earliest practicable date after the senior executive's response, if any; and

(v) An opportunity to request, within 7 days after the date of that decision, reconsideration by the head of the agency, whose determination with respect to that request will be final and not subject to further review.
