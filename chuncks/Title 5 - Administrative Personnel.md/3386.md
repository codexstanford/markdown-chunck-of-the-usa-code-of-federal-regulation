####### Involuntarily separated

refers to a separation initiated by an agency against an employee's will and without the employee's consent for reasons other than cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency. In addition, when an employee is separated because he or she declines to accept reassignment to another geographic area outside one of the covered locations, the separation is involuntary if the employee's position description or other written agreement does not provide for such reassignment. However, an employee's separation is not involuntary if, after such a written mobility agreement is added, the employee accepts one reassignment outside his or her particular territory, possession, or commonwealth, but subsequently declines another reassignment. An employee's separation as a result of disability retirement, a disability that prevents an employee from continuing Federal service or is the basis for separation by the agency as determined by acceptable medical evidence, or the death of an employee is considered to be an involuntary separation.
