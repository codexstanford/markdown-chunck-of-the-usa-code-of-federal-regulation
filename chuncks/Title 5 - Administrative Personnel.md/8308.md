###### Unavailability of identification documentation.

(D)If an individual is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the records sought to be accessed, the official having operational control over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may be considered appropriate; e.g., statements of other individuals who can attest to the identity of the requester. No verification of identity will be required of individuals seeking access to records which are otherwise available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, Freedom of Information Act.
