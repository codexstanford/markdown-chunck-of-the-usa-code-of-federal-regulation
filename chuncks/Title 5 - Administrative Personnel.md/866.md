####### Creditable overseas service.

(b)For purposes of this section only, creditable service is service in an appropriated fund position(s) performed by a family member under a local hire appointment(s) overseas during the time the family member was accompanying a sponsor officially assigned to an overseas area and for which the family member received a fully successful or better (or equivalent) performance rating. Creditable overseas service is computed in accordance with the procedures in the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions. Creditable service may have been under more than one appointment and need not be continuous. Leave without pay taken during the time an individual is in the overseas area is credited on the same basis as time worked.
