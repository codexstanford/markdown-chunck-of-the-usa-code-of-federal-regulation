######## Step 10.,i.e.,

(j)OPM computes expenditure weights by dividing each DEC or aggregate by the total expenditure derived from the DC expenditure computed in step 8. Therefore, the sum of the MEGs, PEGs, and DECs, will separately total 100,so that all consumer expenditures in the original tabulation are accounted for.
