###### Duplication of records.

(c)IPEC will charge duplication fees to all requesters. IPEC will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular format if IPEC can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. If IPEC provides photocopies, IPEC will make one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks or other media, IPEC will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where IPEC must scan paper documents in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, IPEC will charge the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, IPEC will charge the direct costs. IPEC will provide the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) without charge except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use.
