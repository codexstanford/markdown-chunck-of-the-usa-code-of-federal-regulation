####### Approval criteria and written determination.

(d)(1) For each determination to pay a retention incentive under this section, an agency must document in writing-

(i) The basis for determining the agency has a special need for the employee's (or group of employees') services that makes it essential to retain the employee(s), based on the agency's mission needs and the employee's (or group of employees') competencies, during a period of time before the closure or relocation of the employee's (or group of employees') office, facility, activity, or organization;

(ii) The basis for determining, in the absence of a retention incentive, the employee (or a significant number of employees in a group) would be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service; and

(iii) The basis for establishing the amount and timing of the approved retention incentive payment and the length of the required service period.

(2) An agency must address the following factors when documenting the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for an individual employee:

(i) The factors for authorizing a retention incentive for an individual employee described in ยง 575.306(b) as they relate to a determination made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

(ii) The extent to which the employee's departure for a different position in the Federal service would affect the agency's ability to carry out an activity, perform a function, or complete a project the agency deems essential to its mission before and during the closure or relocation period (e.g., the agency's need to retain the employee to ensure minimal disruption in the performance of mission-critical functions, continuity of key operations, or minimal disruption of service to the public before and during the closure or relocation; to train new employees who will move with the organization to the new geographic location; to assist with the actual closure or relocation of the office, facility, activity, or organization; or to perform similar mission-essential functions before or during the closure or relocation);

(iii) The competencies possessed by the employee that are essential to retain; and

(iv) The agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch) for which the employee would be likely to leave in the absence of the retention incentive.

(3) An agency must address the following factors when documenting the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for a group or category of employees:

(i) The factors for authorizing a retention incentive for a group or category of employees described in ยง 575.306(c) as they relate to the determination made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

(ii) The factors in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(2)(iv) of this section as they relate to the determination made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the group or category of employees.

(4) An agency must narrowly define a targeted category of employees using factors that relate to the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The factors that may be appropriate are described in ยง 575.306(c)(2), except that each group retention incentive authorized under this section may cover no more than one occupational series.
