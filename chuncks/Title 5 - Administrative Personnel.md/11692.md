### PART 3601 - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
#### ยง 3601.103 Additional exceptions for gifts from outside sources.
##### Example 2 to paragraph (a)

[No community relations interest]: A foundation that provides grants to non-profit organizations focusing on environmental initiatives is sponsoring a fundraising golf tournament. The foundation is offering to waive the entry fee for military personnel at the local installation. Military personnel may not accept the offer by the sponsor to waive the entry fee under paragraph (a) of this section, because participation in this event does not further local community relations interests for the DoD installation. While the community relations exception may not be used to accept the gift, nothing in this section precludes an employee from accepting the gift if another gift exclusion, exception, or authority would apply.
