###### Means of access.

(a)(1) The methods for allowing access to records, when such access has been granted by CIGIE, are:

(i) Examination in person in a designated office during the hours specified by CIGIE; or

(ii) Providing copies of the records.

(2) When a requester has not indicated whether he wants a copy of the record or wants to examine the record in person, CIGIE may choose the means of granting access. However, the means chosen should not unduly impede the requester's right of access. A requester may elect to receive a copy of the records after having examined them.
