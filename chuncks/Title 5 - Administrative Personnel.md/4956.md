####### CSRS annuitants.

(b)(1) The annuity of a CSRS annuitant terminates on reemployment if-

(i) The annuitant is a disability annuitant whom OPM has found recovered or restored to earning capacity prior to reemployment, or whose disability annuity was awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) because the annuitant was a National Guard Technician who was medically disqualified for continued membership in the National Guard;

(ii) The annuitant is not a retired Member and the annuity is based on an involuntary separation (other than a separation that was mandated by statute based on the annuitant's age and length of service, or a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency) where the reemployment would, if the individual were not an annuitant, be covered by CSRS;

(iii) The annuitant is not a retired Member and is appointed by the President to a position that would, if the individual were not an annuitant, be covered by CSRS; or

(iv) The annuitant is not a retired Member and is elected as a Member.

(2) A disability annuity awarded a former National Guard Technician under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) shall terminate on the date the annuitant declines an offer of employment with a department or agency, where the employment is in the same commuting area and of the same grade as, or a level equivalent to, the position from which the annuitant retired.
