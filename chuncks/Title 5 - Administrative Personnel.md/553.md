####### When an organization does not have records in its custody.

(e)When an OPM organization receives a Freedom of Information Act request for OPM records that it does not have in its possession, it will normally either-

(1) Retrieve the records from the organization that has possession of them; or

(2) Promptly forward the request to the appropriate organization. If a person has asked to be kept apprised of anything that will delay the official receipt of a request, OPM will provide notice of this forwarding action. Otherwise, OPM may, at its option, provide such notice.
