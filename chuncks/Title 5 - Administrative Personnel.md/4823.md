####### Notice of debt.

(6)When a creditor agency cannot send a complete debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so the lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.

(i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for and amount of the debt, if known. If the amount of the debt is not known, the agency must establish the amount and notify OPM in writing as soon as possible after submitting the notice.

(ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation in column 8 [Remarks] under "Fiscal Record" on the Standard Form 2806 (Individual Retirement Record), if the SF 2806 is in its possession, or if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the debtor by name, giving his or her date of birth, social security number, and date of separation, if known.
