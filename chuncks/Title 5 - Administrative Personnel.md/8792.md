###### Plan-paid breakage.

(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if, because of an error committed by the Board or the TSP record keeper, a participant's account is not credited or charged with the investment gains or losses the account would have received had the error not occurred, the account will be credited accordingly.

(2) Errors that warrant the crediting of breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to:

(i) Delay in crediting contributions or other money to a participant's account;

(ii) Improper issuance of a loan or TSP withdrawal payment to a participant or beneficiary which requires the money to be restored to the participant's account; and

(iii) Investment of all or part of a participant's account in the wrong investment fund(s).

(3) A participant will not be entitled to breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the participant had the use of the money on which the investment gains would have accrued.

(4) If the participant continued to have a TSP account, or would have continued to have a TSP account but for the Board or TSP record keeper's error, the TSP record keeper will compute gains or losses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the relevant period based upon the investment funds in which the affected money would have been invested had the error not occurred. If the participant did not have, and should not have had, a TSP account during this period, then the TSP will use the rate of return set forth in ยง 1605.2(b) for the relevant period and return the money to the participant.
