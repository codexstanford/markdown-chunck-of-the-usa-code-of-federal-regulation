####### Procedure.

(b)(1) Requests for waivers must be submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, via the requester's agency, within 10 days after an employee learns that the employee will hold a position which requires reporting and that the employee will serve in that position for more than 60 days in any calendar year, or upon serving in such a position for more than 60 days, whichever is earlier.

(2) The request must consist of:

(i) A cover letter which identifies the individual and the position, states the approximate number of days in a calendar year which the employee expects to serve in that position, and requests a waiver of public reporting requirements under this section;

(ii) An enclosure which states the reasons for the individual's belief that the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met in the particular case; and

(iii) The report otherwise required by this subpart, as a factual basis for the determination required by this section. The report must bear the legend: "CONFIDENTIAL: WAIVER REQUEST PENDING PURSUANT TO 5 CFR 2634.205."

(3) The agency in which the individual serves must advise the Office of Government Ethics as to the justification for a waiver.

(4) In the event a waiver is granted, the report will not be subject to the public disclosure requirements of ยง 2634.603; however, the waiver request cover letter will be subject to those requirements. In the event that a waiver is not granted, the confidential legend will be removed from the report, and the report will be subject to public disclosure; however, the waiver request cover letter will not then be subject to public disclosure.
