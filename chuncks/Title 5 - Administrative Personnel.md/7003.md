###### ยง 892.211 What options are available to me if I go on a period of leave without pay (LWOP) or other types of non-pay status?
####### Pre-pay.

(2)Prior to commencement of your LWOP you may allot through payroll deduction the amount that will be due for your share of your FEHB premium during your LWOP period, if your employing agency, at its discretion, allows you to do so. Contributions under the pre-pay option may be made through premium conversion on a pre-tax basis. Alternatively, you may pre-pay premiums for the LWOP period on an after-tax basis.
