###### ยง 1204.11 Request for access to Board records.
####### Extension of time.

(1)If "unusual circumstances" exist, the Board may extend the time for deciding the request by no more than 10 additional workdays. An example of unusual circumstances could be the need to find and retrieve records from regional or field offices or from federal records centers or the need to search, collect and or examine a large number of records which are demanded in a single request, or the need to talk to another agency with a substantial interest in the determination of the request. When the Board extends the time to decide the request, it will inform the requester in writing and describe the "unusual circumstances", and it will state a date on which a decision on the request will be made. If the "unusual circumstances" are such that the Board cannot comply with the request within the time limit, the Board will offer the requester an opportunity:

(i) To limit the request so that it may be processed within the time limit, or

(ii) To arrange with the Board a different time frame for processing the request or a changed request.
