(A) A period of more than 14 days after receipt of the payment request by the designated agency office; or

(B) A longer period specified in the solicitation and/or contract if required, to afford the Government a practicable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the vendor's performance under the contract;

(ii) Any amounts that the agency has retained pursuant to a prime contract clause providing for retaining a percentage of progress payments otherwise due to a vendor and that are approved for release to the vendor, if such retained amounts are not paid to the vendor by a date specified in the contract, or, in the absence of such a specified date, by the 30th day after final acceptance;

(iii) Final payments, based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts), and payments for partial performances that have been accepted by the agency, if such payments are made after the later of:

(A) The 30th day after the date on which the designated agency office receives a proper invoice; or

(B) The 30th day after agency acceptance of the completed work or services. Acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of contract settlement on a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions.
