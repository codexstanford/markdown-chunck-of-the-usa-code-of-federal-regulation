#### ยง 5501.104 Prohibited financial interests applicable to employees of the Food and Drug Administration.
##### de minimis

(i) The total cost or value, measured at the time of acquisition, of the combined interests of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children in the regulated organization is equal to or less than theexemption limit for matters involving parties established by 5 CFR 2640.202(a) or $15,000, whichever is greater (the phrase "time of acquisition" shall mean the date on which the employee actually acquired the financial interest-or on which the financial interest became imputed to the employee under 18 U.S.C. 208-whether by purchase, gift, bequest, marriage, or otherwise, except that with respect to a financial interest that was acquired prior to the employee's entrance on duty as an employee of the Food and Drug Administration, the "time of acquisition" shall be deemed to be the date on which the employee entered on duty);

(ii) The holding, if it represents an equity interest, constitutes less than 1 percent of the total outstanding equity of the organization; and

(iii) The total holdings in significantly regulated organizations account for less than 50 percent of the total value of the combined investment portfolios of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children.

(3) An employee or spouse or minor child of an employee may have an interest in a significantly regulated organization that constitutes any interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund (e.g., a mutual fund), or a widely held pension or similar fund, which, in the literature it distributes to prospective and current investors or participants, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in significantly regulated organizations, if the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.

(4) In cases involving exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee may grant a written exception to permit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to hold a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization based upon a determination that the application of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality or objectivity with which HHS programs are administered or to avoid a violation of part 2635 of this title.
