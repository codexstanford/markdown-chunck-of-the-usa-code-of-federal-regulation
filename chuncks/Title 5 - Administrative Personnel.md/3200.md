######## Directed to participate

(1)means that the training is required by the agency and the employee's performance or continued retention in his or her current position will be adversely affected by nonenrollment in such training. The fact that an agency pays for all or part of the expenses of training does not create an entitlement to overtime hours of work unless participation in the training is directed by the agency.

(2) Training "to improve the employee's performance * * * of his or her current position" is distinguished from upward mobility training or developmental training to provide an employee the knowledge or skills needed for a subsequent position in the same career field.

(c) Time spent by an employee within an agency's allowance of preparatory time for attendance at training shall be considered hours of work if such preparatory time is:

(1) During an employee's regular working hours; or

(2) Outside the employee's regular working hours, and the purpose of the training meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(d) Time spent attending a lecture, meeting, or conference shall be considered hours of work if attendance is:

(1) During an employee's regular working hours; or

(2) Outside an employee's regular working hours, and

(i) The employee is directed by an agency to attend such an event; or

(ii) The employee performs work for the benefit of the agency during such attendance.
