(b)The TSP record keeper will automatically transfer a surviving spouse's death benefit to a beneficiary participant account (described in ยง 1651.19) established in the spouse's name. The TSP record keeper will not maintain a beneficiary participant account if the balance of the beneficiary participant account is less than $200 on the date the account is established.
