####### § 839.1114 Will OPM actuarially reduce my benefit if I elect to change my retirement coverage under these rules?

Your annuity may be subject to three possible actuarial reductions under the FERCCA. These reductions may be required for an unpaid deposit (see § 831.303(d) and § 839.1116 of this chapter), for Government contributions in a TSP account (see § 839.1118), or for a previous payment of the Basic Employee Death Benefit (see § 839.1121).
