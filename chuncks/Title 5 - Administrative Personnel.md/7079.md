(2) Proof of inclusion of the child as a dependent on the enrollee's income tax returns;

(3) Canceled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic payments from the enrollee for or on behalf of the child.

(4) Evidence of goods or services which show regular and substantial contributions of considerable value;
