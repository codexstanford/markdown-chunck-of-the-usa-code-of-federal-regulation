(a) A Border Patrol agent's travel time to and from home and the agent's regular duty station (or to an alternative work location within the limits of the agent's official duty station, as defined in ยง 550.112(j)) may not be considered hours of work under any provision of law.

(b) Official travel time away from an agent's official duty station may be creditable hours of work as provided in ยง 550.112(g). When an agent travels directly between home and a temporary duty location outside the limits of the agent's official duty station (as defined in ยง 550.112(j)), the time the agent would have spent in normal home to work travel must be deducted from any creditable hours of work while traveling.
