##### ยง 10400.21 How do I make a Privacy Act request?
###### What should my request include?

(c)You must describe the record that you seek in enough detail to enable IPEC to locate the system of records containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Include specific information about each record sought, such as the time period in which you believe it was compiled, the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe it is kept, and the date, title or name, author, recipient, or subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the record that you seek, the more likely we will be able to locate it in response to your request.
