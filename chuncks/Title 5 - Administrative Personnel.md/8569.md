Recipients of Federal assistance may pay interest penalties if so specified in their contracts with contractors. However, obligations to pay such interest penalties will not be obligations of the United States. Federal funds may not be used for this purpose, nor may interest penalties be used to meet matching requirements of federally assisted programs.
