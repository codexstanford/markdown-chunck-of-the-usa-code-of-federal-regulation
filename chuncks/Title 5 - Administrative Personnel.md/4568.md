####### Post-April 6, 1986 average pay

means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of creditable service, the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service by an employee during that period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect, except that for periods of service before April 7, 1986, the actual rate of basic pay based on the employee's established tour of duty, if different, is used in the computation. The rates of pay included in the computation for intermittent service or temporary service performed on a full-time basis are the actual rates of basic pay during those periods of creditable service.
