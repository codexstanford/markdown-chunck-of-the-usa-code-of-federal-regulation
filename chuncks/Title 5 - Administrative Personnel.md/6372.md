###### ยง 875.213 May I apply as a qualified relative if I am the domestic partner of an employee or annuitant?

You may apply for coverage as a qualified relative if you are a domestic partner, as described in ยง 875.101. As prescribed by OPM, you will be required to provide documentation to demonstrate that you meet these requirements, and you must submit to full underwriting requirements. However, as explained in ยง 875.210, if you lose your status as a domestic partner, and therefore status as a qualified relative, before your coverage goes into effect, you are no longer eligible for FLTCIP coverage.
