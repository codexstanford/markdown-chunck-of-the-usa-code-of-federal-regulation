(3)(i) OPM will notify annuitants and survivors of the amount of the deposit and give them a proposed installment schedule for paying the deposit from monthly annuity payments. The proposed installment payments will consist of equal monthly payments that will not exceed a period 24 months from the date a complete written application is received by OPM.

(ii) The annuitant or survivor may allow the installments to be deducted from his or her annuity as proposed or make payment in a lump sum within 30 days from the date of the notice.

(iii) Increased annuity payments will begin to accrue the first day of the month after OPM receives a complete written application.

(iv) If an annuitant dies before completing the deposit installment payments, the remaining installments will be deducted as established for the annuitant, from benefits payable to the survivor annuitant (but not if the only survivor benefit is payable to a child or children of the deceased), if any. If no survivor annuity is payable, OPM may collect the balance of the deposit from any lump-sum benefits payable or the decedent's estate, if any.
