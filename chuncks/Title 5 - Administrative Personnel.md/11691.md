##### Example 1 to paragraph (a)

[Community relations interest]: The City of Jacksonville, Florida, hosts a Military Appreciation Day event. Members of the general public are charged an admission fee to attend. Department of the Navy employees who have recently returned from deployment are invited and offered free admission for themselves and a guest. These Navy employees may personally accept the gift of free attendance for themselves and a guest, if their agency designee determines that their attendance at the event will serve a community relations interest and that employees' attendance outweighs concerns that acceptance would call into question their integrity or impartiality.
