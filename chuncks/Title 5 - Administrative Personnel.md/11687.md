#### ยง 3601.102 Designation of DoD components as separate agencies for purposes of gifts from outside sources, and teaching, speaking, and writing.
##### Example 3 to paragraph (a).

For paragraph (a)(11) of this section [Agency designation]: An employee of the Department of the Air Force is offered a gift by a company that only does business with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, which is designated as a separate agency. The company would be a prohibited source of gifts for employees of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency but not for employees of the Department of the Air Force or for any other component which has been designated as a separate agency.

(b) Employees of DoD components not designated as separate agencies, including employees of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, will be treated as employees of the "Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) remainder agency." The OSD remainder agency shall itself be treated as a separate DoD agency for purposes of determining whether the donor of a gift is a prohibited source under 5 CFR 2635.203(d) and for identifying the employee's agency under 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking, and writing.

(1) The use of the term "agency" in this part does not carry with it the designation and responsibilities of a "defense agency" as set forth in 10 U.S.C. 191-197 (2019).

(2) For purposes of this part, "prohibited source" is defined at 5 CFR 2635.203(d), except that "agency" shall mean the employee's component.
