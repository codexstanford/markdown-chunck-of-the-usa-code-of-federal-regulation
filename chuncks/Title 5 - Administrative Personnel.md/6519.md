####### Insurable interest survivor annuity.

(3)A current spouse who is an insurable interest beneficiary under ยง 831.606(b) or ยง 842.605(b) of this title is eligible to continue health benefits enrollment as an insurable interest survivor annuitant so long as he or she was covered as a family member at the time of the annuitant's death. This entitlement applies even if the spouse is eligible for continued enrollment as a survivor annuitant under another section of 5 CFR parts 831 or 843. To prevent dual coverage, the spouse must be covered under only one health benefits enrollment under this part.
