####### Allotters.

(b)The allotment privilege will be made available to Federal personnel as follows:

(1) Employees whose net pay regularly is sufficient to cover the allotment are eligible. An employee serving under an appointment limited to 1 year or less may make an allotment to a CFC when an appropriate official of the employing Federal agency determines that the employee will continue employment for a period sufficient to justify an allotment. This includes military reservists, National Guard, and other part-time and intermittent employees who are regularly employed.

(2) Members of the Uniformed Services are eligible, excluding those on only short-term assignment (less than 3 months).
