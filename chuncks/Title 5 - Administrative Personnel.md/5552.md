####### Distinct periods of service.

(d)A deposit is not considered to have been made for any distinct period of service unless the total amount due for the period is paid in full. A "distinct period" for this purpose is the total years, months, and days from the date of entry on active duty (or from January 1, 1957, if later) to the date of final discharge for enlisted military personnel, or to the date of final release from active duty for officers and reservists. A "distinct period" also includes consecutive periods of service where there is no break in service, but does not include any lost time.
