####### Medical surveillance

is the on-going systematic collection and analysis of health data to improve and protect the health and safety of employees in the workplace, and to monitor for health trends both in individual workers and in population of workers. Medical surveillance can include the tracking of occupational injuries, illnesses, hazards, and exposures, as well as laboratory and examination-based medical data, in order to identify findings that could provide an early warning of, or indicate the risk for, an occupational disease. Medical surveillance also is part of compliance with those Federal and state regulations that require medical monitoring when employees use or are exposed to certain hazardous materials.
