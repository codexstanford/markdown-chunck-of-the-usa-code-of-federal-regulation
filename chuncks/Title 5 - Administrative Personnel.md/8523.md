###### Review of invoice.

(c)Agencies will use the following procedures in reviewing invoices:

(1) Each invoice will be reviewed by the designated agency office as soon as practicable after receipt to determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice as defined in ยง 1315.9(b);

(2) When an invoice is determined to be improper, the agency shall return the invoice to the vendor as soon as practicable after receipt, but no later than 7 days after receipt (refer also to paragraph (g)(4) of this section regarding vendor notification and determining the payment due date.) The agency will identify all defects that prevent payment and specify all reasons why the invoice is not proper and why it is being returned. This notification to the vendor shall include a request for a corrected invoice, to be clearly marked as such;

(3) Any media which produce tangible recordings of information in lieu of "written" or "original" paper document equivalents should be used by agencies to expedite the payment process, rather than delaying the process by requiring "original" paper documents. Agencies should ensure adequate safeguards and controls to ensure the integrity of the data and to prevent duplicate processing.
