###### ยง 837.304 Agency liability for payments.

(a) The agency will remit funds properly withheld from the pay of a reemployed annuitant in accordance with this subpart to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.

(b) When the employing agency fails to withhold from the pay of the reemployed annuitant some or all of the amounts required to be withheld from that pay by this subpart, the employee has received an overpayment of pay. The employing agency must collect the overpayment of pay (unless it is waived under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or some other applicable statute) and remit the proper funds to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.

(c) If the employing agency waives the annuitant's repayment of the salary overpayment, it must submit-on behalf of the reemployed annuitant-an amount equal to the correct deduction from pay (or the balance due in the case of a partial deduction) to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
