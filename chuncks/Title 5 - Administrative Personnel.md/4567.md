####### Part-time service

means any actual service performed on a less than full-time basis, by an individual whose appointment describes a regularly scheduled tour of duty, and any period of time credited as non pay status time under 5 U.S.C. 8332(f), which follows a period of part-time service without any intervening period of actual service other than part-time service. This definition is not limited to part-time career employment because it includes part-time temporary employment as well.
