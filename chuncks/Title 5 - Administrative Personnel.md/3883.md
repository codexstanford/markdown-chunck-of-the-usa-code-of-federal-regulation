####### Placement

means a new placement of a son or daughter with an employee for adoption or foster care. For example, this excludes the adoption of a stepchild or a foster child who has already been a member of the employee's household and has an existing parent-child relationship with an adopting parent. When the term "placement" is used in connection with the use of leave under this subpart before placement has occurred, it refers to a planned or anticipated placement.
