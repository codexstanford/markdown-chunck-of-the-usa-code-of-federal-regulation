A general non-specific award will apply to any employee annuity payable, including phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity (&#xB6;&#xB6; 201-211). For example, an award dividing employee annuity that uses terms such as "annuities," "pensions," "retirement benefits," or similar general terms, would apply to all types of employee annuity.

To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must expressly state that it is directed at "phased retirement annuity" or "composite retirement annuity," and must indicate the share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction. That is, it must state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., "net phased retirement annuity"). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity.

It should be noted that a former spouse survivor annuity cannot be awarded from a phased retirement annuity; therefore, a phased retirement annuity is not subject to reduction to provide a former spouse survivor annuity. As a consequence, an award dividing either "self-only phased retirement annuity" or a "gross phased retirement annuity" would be directed at identical annuities. However, a former spouse survivor annuity can be awarded from a composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status (i.e., when the "phased retiree" enters full retirement status and becomes a "retiree"); therefore, there would be a difference between an award of a share of "self-only composite retirement annuity" and an award of a share of "gross composite retirement annuity."

Due to the complexity of the benefits, care should be taken in drafting separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity. It should also be noted, for example, that an award directed only at the division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree will not be effective to divide annuity payable to an employee who retires in the usual manner, without having entered phased retirement status first. If separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity are to be provided, consideration should be given to including provisions in the paragraph addressing the possibility that the employee may retire in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring. Similarly, if employee annuity is only to be awarded in the event the employee retires in the usual manner, without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, consideration should be given to including specific language to that effect.

Using the following paragraph will award phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity and provides for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status:

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. When [employee] enters full retirement status and receives a composite retirement annuity, [former spouse] is awarded [insert language awarding fraction, formula, or `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s monthly [insert "gross," "net" or "self-only"] composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is entitled to [insert appropriate language from 200 series or 300 series paragraphs] under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following will award composite retirement annuity when an employee enters phased retirement status and subsequently enters full retirement status, and provides for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without having entered phased retirement status; however, the paragraph will not award a phased retirement annuity when the employee enters phased retirement status:

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status and subsequently enters full retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is entitled to [insert appropriate language from 200 series or 300 series paragraphs] under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Use the following paragraph if the former spouse is only to be awarded a portion of the employee's annuity when the employee retires in the usual manner, without an award of a portion of the employee's phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity in the event that the employee enters phased retirement status. It should be noted, however, that if this conditional clause provided below is used in an appropriate 200 or 300 series paragraph without a conditional award of a portion of phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity if the employee enters phased retirement status and then enters full retirement status:

"If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is awarded [insert remaining language for the paragraph from the appropriate 200 series or 300 series]. . . The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Use the following paragraph to award only phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity. This paragraph will not award benefits if the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status:

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s monthly [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. When [employee] enters full retirement status and receives a composite retirement annuity, [former spouse] is awarded [insert language awarding percentage, fraction, formula, or pro rata share] of [employee]'s monthly [insert "gross," "net" or "self-only"] composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following will award only phased retirement annuity. This paragraph will not award composite retirement annuity when the employee enters full retirement status nor will it provide for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status. It should be noted that if this paragraph is used, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity benefits if the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status first:

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following will award only composite retirement annuity when the employee enters full retirement status following phased retirement. This paragraph will not award phased retirement annuity when the employee enters phased retirement status nor will it provide for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status. It should be noted that if this paragraph is used, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity benefits if the employee retires without entering full retirement status from phased retirement status:

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status and enters full retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will award COLA's in addition to a fixed monthly amount to the former spouse. The model awards COLA's at the same rate applied to the employee annuity.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. When COLA's are applied to [employee]'s retirement benefits, the same COLA applies to [former spouse]'s share. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will prevent application of COLA's to a former spouse's share of an employee annuity in cases where the former spouse has been awarded a percentage, fraction or pro rata share of the employee annuity, rather than a fixed dollar amount.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Insert language for computing the former spouse's share from &#xB6; 202, &#xB6; 203, &#xB6; 204, &#xB6; 211, or &#xB6;&#xB6; 212-217 of this appendix.] The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to determine the amount of [former spouse]'s share on the date [insert `when [employee] retires or enters phased retirement status' or if the employee has not retired or entered phased retirement status, or `of this order' if the employee is already retired or entered phased retirement status] and not to apply COLA's to that amount. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Awards of employee annuity to a former spouse (other than awards of fixed dollar amounts) must specify whether OPM will use the "phased retirement annuity," "composite retirement annuity," "gross annuity," "net annuity," or "self-only annuity" as defined in § 838.103 (see also § 838.306) in determining the amount of the former spouse's entitlement. The court order may contain a formula that has the effect of creating other types of annuity, but the court order may only do this by providing a formula that starts from "phased retirement annuity," "composite retirement annuity," "gross annuity," "net annuity," or "self-only annuity" as defined in § 838.103.

The court order may include a formula that effectively uses the court's definition of net annuity rather than the one provided by § 838.103. For example, using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity reduced only by the amount deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance Program.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the self-only annuity less the amount deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance Program. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse a prorata share of what the employee annuity would have been based on only the employee's actual service in cases where the actual employee annuity is based on disability. The paragraph also allows the court order to provide for the former spouse's share to begin when the employee reaches a stated age, using age 62 as an example. As with all other formulas the court order must specify whether the computation applies to "gross," "net," or self-only annuity. OPM will apply COLA's that occurred after the date of the disability retirement to the former spouse's share. The following paragraph should be used only for disability retirees under CSRS. Under FERS, section 8452 of title 5, United States Code, provides a formula for recomputation of disability annuities at age 62 to approximate an earned annuity. Therefore to award a portion of the "earned" benefit under FERS add the introductory phrase, "Starting when [employee] reaches age 62," to the paragraph describing how to compute the amount.

"[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United State's Government. Starting when [employee] reaches age 62, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert "gross," "net," or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the amount of [employee]'s monthly annuity computed as though [employee] had retired on an immediate, nondisability annuity on the commencing date of [employee]'s annuity based on disability. In computing the amount of the immediate annuity, the United States Office of Personnel Management will deem [employee] to have been age 62 at the time that [employee] retired on disability. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

Court orders that award a former spouse a portion of a future employee annuity of an employee who is not then eligible to retire should include an additional paragraph containing instructions that tell OPM what to do if the employee separates before becoming eligible to retire and requests a refund of employee contributions. The court order may award the former spouse a portion of the refund of employee contributions or bar payment of the refund of employee contributions.

Using the following paragraph will bar payment of the refund of employee contributions if payment of the refund of employee contributions would extinguish the former spouse's entitlement to a portion of the employee annuity. "The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed not to pay [employee] a refund of employee contributions."

Using the following paragraph will allow the refund of employee contributions to be paid but will award a prorata share of the refund of employee contributions to the former spouse. The sentence on the beginning date of the marriage is unnecessary if the beginning is stated elsewhere in the order. The award of a prorata share is used only as an example; the court order could provide another fraction, percentage, or formula, or a fixed amount. Note that a refund of employee contributions voids the employee's rights to an employee annuity and the former spouse's right to any portion of that annuity.

"If [employee] becomes eligible and applies for a refund of employee contributions, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of the refund of employee contributions. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse]."

No special provision is necessary to restore the entire annuity to the retiree upon the death of the former spouse. Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, OPM will pay the former spouse's share to the retiree after the death of the former spouse.

Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse's share of an employee annuity to the children, including any adopted children, of the employee and former spouse.

"If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to surviving children of the marriage including any adopted children, in equal shares. Upon the deaths of any child, that child's share will be distributed among the other surviving children."

The language may be modified to terminate the payments to the children when they reach a stated age. A court order that includes such a provision for termination must include sufficient information (such as the children's dates of birth) to permit OPM to determine when the children's interest terminate. OPM will not consider evidence outside the court order (and normal OPM files) to establish the children's dates of birth.

Using the following paragraph will provide for payment of the former spouse's share of an employee annuity to the court after the death of the former spouse. This would allow a court officer to administer the funds. "If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to this court at the following address: "[Insert address where checks should be sent. The address may be up to six lines and should include sufficient information for court officials to credit the correct account.]"
