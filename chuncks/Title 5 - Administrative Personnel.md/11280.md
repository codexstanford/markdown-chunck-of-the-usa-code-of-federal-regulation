####### Agency certification concerning need for individual's services.

(b)In determining whether the need for an individual's services on an advisory committee outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by the disqualifying financial interest, the responsible official may consider the following factors:

(1) The type of interest that is creating the disqualification (e.g. stock, bonds, real estate, other securities, cash payment, job offer, or enhancement of a spouse's employment);

(2) The identity of the person whose financial interest is involved, and if the interest is not the individual's, the relationship of that person to the individual;

(3) The uniqueness of the individual's qualifications;

(4) The difficulty of locating a similarly qualified individual without a disqualifying financial interest to serve on the committee;

(5) The dollar value of the disqualifying financial interest, if it is known or can be estimated (e.g. the amount of cash payment which may be gained or lost, the salary of the job which will be gained or lost, the predictable change in either the market value of the stock or the actual or potential profit or loss or cost of the matter to the company issuing the stock, the change in the value of real estate or other securities);

(6) The value of the financial instrument or holding from which the disqualifying financial interest arises (e.g. the face value of the stock, bond, other security or real estate) and its value in relationship to the individual's assets. If the disqualifying financial interest is that of a general partner or organization specified in section 208, this information must be provided only to the extent that it is known by the employee; and

(7) The extent to which the disqualifying financial interest will be affected individually or particularly by the actions of the advisory committee.
