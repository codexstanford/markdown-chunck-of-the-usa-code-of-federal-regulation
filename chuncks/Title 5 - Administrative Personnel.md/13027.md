###### Review

means the process of examining documents that are located during a search to determine if any portion should lawfully be withheld. It is the process of determining disclosability. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under ยง 10400.18, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
