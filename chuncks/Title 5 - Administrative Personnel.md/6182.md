####### Digital signature

means an electronic signature generated by means of an algorithm that ensures that the identity of the signatory and the integrity of the data can be verified. A value, referred to as the "private key," is generated to produce the signature and another value, known as the "public key," which is linked to but is not the same as the private key, is used to verify the signature.
