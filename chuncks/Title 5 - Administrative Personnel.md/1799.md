####### General.

(a)In determining whether to provide training under this section, agencies should take into account:

(1) Agency authority to modify qualification requirements in certain situations as provided in the OPM Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions;

(2) Agency authority to establish training programs that provide intensive and directly job-related training to substitute for all or part of the experience (but not education, licensing, certification, or other specific credentials), required by OPM qualification standards. Such training programs may be established to provide employees with the opportunity to acquire the experience and knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to qualify for another position (including at a higher grade) at an accelerated rate; and

(3) Time-in-grade restrictions on advancement (see 5 CFR 300.603(b)(6)).
