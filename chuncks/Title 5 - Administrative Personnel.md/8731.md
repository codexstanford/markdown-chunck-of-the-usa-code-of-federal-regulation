###### Fund transfers into mutual fund window.

(a)A participant may elect to make one or more fund transfers to the mutual fund window from the portion of his or her TSP balance invested in the TSP core funds, subject to the following rules:

(1) The participant must establish a mutual fund window account that is separate from his or her TSP account. A participant with more than one TSP account may establish a separate mutual fund window account for each TSP account, and the limitations and fees described in subpart will apply separately to each account;

(2) If the participant does not have an acknowledgment of risk on file as of the date of his or her initial fund transfer request to the mutual fund window, the participant must complete an acknowledgment of risk for the fund transfer to be processed;

(3) Fund transfers must be made in whole dollar increments (percentages are not permitted);

(4) The following limitations must be satisfied:

(i) A participant's initial fund transfer into his or her mutual fund window account must be at least $10,000 and may not exceed 25 percent of the participant's TSP account balance, as of the date of such transfer; and

(ii) Subsequent fund transfers into a participant's mutual fund window account may not cause the balance in the participant's mutual fund window account to exceed 25 percent of the participant's total TSP balance, as of the date of any such transfer;

(5) Each fund transfer into the mutual fund window counts toward the monthly limit set forth in ยง 1601.32(b);

(6) Amounts transferred to a participant's mutual fund window account will initially be invested in a sweep money market fund. Subsequently, the participant may direct the investment of the transferred amounts into any mutual fund(s) that are available through the mutual fund window;

(7) Fund transfers are subject to the fees set forth in ยง 1601.53; and

(8) A participant may not withdraw funds directly from his or her mutual fund window account. To make a withdrawal, the participant must elect a fund transfer back to the TSP core funds as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Upon completion of such fund transfer, the participant may make a withdrawal in accordance with 5 CFR part 1650.
