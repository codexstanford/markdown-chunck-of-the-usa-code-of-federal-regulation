#### ยง 6701.104 Prohibited purchases of real estate by certain GSA employees involved in the acquisition or disposal of real estate.
##### Waiver.

(c)An employee may make a purchase otherwise prohibited by this section where a written waiver of the prohibition has been given to the employee by the employee's immediate supervisor, with the advice of a Deputy Standards of Conduct Counsellor or the Designated Agency Ethics Official. Such a waiver may be granted only if a determination is made that the waiver is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation, and that in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular circumstances, the purchase of such real estate or interest therein will not raise a question as to whether the employee will use his official position or nonpublic information to obtain an advantageous purchase or create an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of the employee's duties.
