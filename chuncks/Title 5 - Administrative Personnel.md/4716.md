###### ยง 831.1402 Fault.

A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he/she performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Office of Personnel Management may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.
