means a set of rate ranges established under a single authority-, the General Schedule, a law enforcement officer special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10) under section 403 of FEPCA; a prevailing rate schedule (including a special schedule or special rate schedule) under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on GS rates; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on law enforcement officer special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10); or a special rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar authority. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.
