#### ยง 3601.105 Disclaimer for teaching, speaking, and writing in a personal capacity related to official duties.
##### Example 1 to ยง 3601.105

[Disclaimer Required]: An employee is asked to provide unpaid personal remarks at a local university on a DoD matter she handled in the past year. As part of her introduction, the university facilitator identifies the employee by her official title. Since the subject matter of her speech is related to her official duties, and her official title is used, she must provide a reasonably prominent disclaimer at the beginning of her remarks.
