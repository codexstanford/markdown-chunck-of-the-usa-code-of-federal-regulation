###### ยง 1204.14 Requests for access to confidential commercial information.
####### Exceptions to notice requirements.

(h)The notice requirements of this section do not apply when:

(1) The Board decides that the information should not be released;

(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or

(4) The disclosure is required by an agency rule that:

(i) Was adopted after notice and public comment;

(ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency that are to be released under the FOIA; or

(iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is submitted or a reasonable time thereafter, that release of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

(5) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from release according to agency regulations issued under this section, when the submitter has an opportunity to do so at the time of sending the information or a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has good reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or

(6) The designation made by the submitter according to Board regulations appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the Board must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative release decision within a reasonable period before the stated release date.
