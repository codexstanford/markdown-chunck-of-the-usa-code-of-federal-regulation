###### Coordination

means the process by which DHS, after appropriate staff-level consultation, officially provides OPM with notice of a proposed action and intended effective date. If OPM concurs, or does not respond to that notice within 30 calendar days, DHS may proceed with the proposed action. However, if OPM indicates the matter has Governmentwide implications or consequences, DHS will not proceed until the matter is resolved. The coordination process is intended to give due deference to the flexibilities afforded DHS by the Homeland Security Act and the regulations in this part, without compromising OPM's institutional responsibility, as codified in 5 U.S.C. chapter 11 and Executive Order 13197 of January 18, 2001, to provide Governmentwide oversight in human resources management programs and practices.
