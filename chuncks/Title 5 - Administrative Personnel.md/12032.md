##### Waivers.

(e)(1) The Chairman may grant a waiver to permit a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee, to retain ownership of a security of an entity on the prohibited securities list upon a determination that the holding of the security is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that:

(i) Under the circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which NRC programs are administered;

(ii) Legal constraints prevent divestiture; or

(iii) For a special Government employee, divestiture would result in substantial financial hardship.

(2) Where a waiver has been granted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the covered employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of the prohibited security, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse or minor child of the employee unless the employee has received a waiver described in 5 CFR 2635.402(d), pursuant to procedures in NRC Handbook 7.9, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room.
