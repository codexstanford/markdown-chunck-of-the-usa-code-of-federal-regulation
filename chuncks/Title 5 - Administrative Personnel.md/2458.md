####### 12-month rule.,i.e.

(c)(1) An authorized agency official may adjust (, increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive not more than once during any 12-month period. However, an agency may make a determination to provide an additional pay increase under certain conditions as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) and (4) of this section without regard to whether the senior executive has received a pay adjustment during the previous 12-month period.

(2) The following pay actions are considered pay adjustments for the purpose of applying this paragraph:

(i) The setting of an individual's rate of basic pay upon initial appointment or reappointment to the SES under paragraphs (a) and (i)(1) of this section and upon reinstatement to the SES under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section; and

(ii) Any adjustment (increase or reduction) in an SES rate of basic pay granted to a senior executive, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(3) The following pay actions are not considered pay adjustments for the purpose of applying this paragraph:

(i) The conversion of senior executives to the new SES pay system under ยง 534.406 and the conversion of other employees to equivalent senior executive positions;

(ii) A determination by an authorized agency official to make a zero adjustment in pay after reviewing a senior executive's annual summary rating;

(iii) A zero adjustment in pay made during the 12-month period preceding the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, caused by the former limitation on basic pay plus locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(g)(2) for a senior executive who was granted an increase in his or her rate of basic pay that did not result in an actual increase in pay;

(iv) A determination to provide an additional pay increase under paragraph (f) of this section when there is an increase in Executive Schedule rates of pay;

(v) [Reserved]

(vi) A determination to provide a pay increase under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to allow a senior executive to maintain his or her relative position in the SES rate range; and

(vii) An increase in pay equivalent to the minimum amount necessary to ensure that a senior executive's rate of basic pay does not fall below the minimum rate of the SES rate range.

(4) An authorized agency official may approve increases in a senior executive's rate of basic pay more than once during a 12-month period if the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) determines that-

(i) The senior executive's exceptionally meritorious accomplishment significantly contributes to the agency's performance;

(ii) A pay increase is necessary to reassign a senior executive to a position with substantially greater scope and responsibility or to recruit a senior executive with superior leadership or other competencies from a position in another agency;

(iii) The retention of the senior executive is critical to the mission of the agency and the senior executive would be likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase; or

(iv) Such action conforms to an otherwise applicable executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle (e.g., in the case of a senior executive who was appointed to an SES position within the past 12 months or a senior executive who was transferred to an SES position from an agency with a different senior executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle within the past 12 months).

(5) An authorized agency official must provide written documentation approving an exception under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Any pay adjustment made as a result of a determination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying ยง 534.404(c) and begins a new 12-month period.
