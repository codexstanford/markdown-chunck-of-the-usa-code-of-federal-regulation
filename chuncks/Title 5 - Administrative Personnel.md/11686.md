### PART 3601 - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
#### ยง 3601.102 Designation of DoD components as separate agencies for purposes of gifts from outside sources, and teaching, speaking, and writing.
##### Example 2 to paragraph (a).

For paragraphs (a)(2) and (18) of this section [Separate component-gift]: An employee of the Department of the Army (Army) and an employee of the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) are each offered a ticket to a football game by a company that contracts with OSD. As long as the contractor is not a prohibited source for the Army and the gift is not offered because of the employee's official position, the Army employee may accept the ticket because the Army is designated as a separate agency under paragraph (a)(2). The JCS employee may not accept the ticket because JCS is not designated as a separate agency and, therefore, is part of the "OSD remainder agency." The OSD contractor is therefore a prohibited source for the JCS employee or for any employee of any of the other organizations that are part of the OSD remainder agency.
