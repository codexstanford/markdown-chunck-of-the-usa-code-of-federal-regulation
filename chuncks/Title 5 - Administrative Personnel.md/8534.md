#### PART 1315 - PROMPT PAYMENT
##### ยง 1315.4 Prompt payment standards and required notices to vendors.
###### Timely payment.

(j)An agency shall make payments no more than seven days prior to the payment due date, but as close to the due date as possible, unless the agency head or designee has determined, on a case-by-case basis for specific payments, that earlier payment is necessary. This authority must be used cautiously, weighing the benefits of making a payment early against the good stewardship inherent in effective cash management practices. An agency may use the "accelerated payment methods" in ยง 1315.5 when it determines that such earlier payment is necessary.
