####### Demonstration Project

means a project conducted by the Office of Personnel Management, or under its supervision, to determine whether a specified change in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved Federal personnel management (5 U.S.C. 4701). The project must require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation which is eligible for waiver under the demonstration authority contained in 5 U.S.C. 4703. A project which can be undertaken under an agency's own authority and does not require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation is not considered a "demonstration project" for purposes of this part.
