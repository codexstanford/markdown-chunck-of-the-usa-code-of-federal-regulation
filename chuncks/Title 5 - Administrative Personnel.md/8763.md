##### ยง 1605.2 Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on late contributions and loan payments.
###### Calculating breakage.

(b)The TSP record keeper will calculate breakage for all contributions or loan payment corrections as follows:

(1) Use the participant's investment election on file for the "as of" date to determine how the funds would have been invested, going back to the earliest daily share prices available. If there is no investment election on file, or one cannot be derived based on the investment of contributions, the TSP record keeper will consider the funds to have been invested in the default investment fund in effect for the participant on the "as of" date;

(2) Determine the number of shares of the applicable investment funds the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the "as of" date is before TSP account balances were converted to shares, this determination will be the number of shares the participant would have received on the conversion date, and will include the daily earnings the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on the "as of" date;

(3) Determine the dollar value on the posting date of the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the contributions or loan payments would have been invested in a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the posting date, the share price of the L Income Fund will be used. The dollar value shall be the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time multiplied by the share price; and

(4) The difference between the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the posting date and the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the "as of" date is the breakage.
