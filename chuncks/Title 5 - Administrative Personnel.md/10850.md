###### ยง 2635.204 Exceptions to the prohibition for acceptance of certain gifts.

Subject to the limitations in ยง 2635.205, this section establishes exceptions to the prohibitions set forth in ยง 2635.202(a) and (b). Even though acceptance of a gift may be permitted by one of the exceptions contained in this section, it is never inappropriate and frequently prudent for an employee to decline a gift if acceptance would cause a reasonable person to question the employee's integrity or impartiality. Section 2635.201(b) identifies considerations for declining otherwise permissible gifts.
