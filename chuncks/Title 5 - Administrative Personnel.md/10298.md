(c)Generally, gifts may be solicited or accepted from any source, including a prohibited source, provided that the standards of this part are met.

However, where a gift is offered by an intermediary, both the intermediary and the ultimate source of the gift should be analyzed to determine whether acceptance would be appropriate.
