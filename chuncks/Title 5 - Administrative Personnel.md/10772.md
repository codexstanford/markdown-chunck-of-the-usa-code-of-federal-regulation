####### Valuation of gifts and travel reimbursements.

(3)The value to be assigned to a gift or travel reimbursement is its fair market value. For most reimbursements, this will be the amount actually received. For gifts, the value should be determined in one of the following manners:

(i) If the gift is readily available in the market, the value will be its retail price. The filer need not contact the donor, but may contact a retail establishment selling similar items to determine the present cost in the market.

(ii) If the item is not readily available in the market, such as a piece of art, the filer may make a good faith estimate of the value of the item.

(iii) The term "readily available in the market" means that an item generally is available for retail purchase.

(4) New entrants, as described in ยง 2634.903(b), need not report any information on gifts and travel reimbursements.
