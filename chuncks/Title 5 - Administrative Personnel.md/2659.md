######## Official duty station.

(j)An agency may prescribe a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine whether an employee's travel is within or outside the limits of the employee's official duty station for determining entitlement to overtime pay for travel under paragraph (g) of this section except that-

(1) An agency's definition of an employee's official duty station for determining overtime pay for travel may not be smaller than the definition of "official station and post of duty" under the Federal Travel Regulation issued by the General Services Administration (41 CFR 300-3.1); and

(2) Travel from home to work and vice versa is not hours of work. When an employee travels directly from home to a temporary duty location outside the limits of his or her official duty station, the time the employee would have spent in normal home to work travel shall be deducted from hours of work.
