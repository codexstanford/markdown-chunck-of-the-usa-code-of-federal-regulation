(ii) The nature of the service to be performed and the position's title, if any;

(iii) The proposed hours of work (if regularly scheduled) and the approximate dates of employment;

(iv) The employee's explanation as to whether the proposed outside employment (including teaching, speaking, or writing) will implicate in any way information obtained as a result of the employee's official Federal position; and

(v) The employee's explanation that no Federal property, resources, or facilities not available to the general public will be used in connection with the outside employment.

(2) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position within the FLRA, the employee must, within seven calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval.

(3) The DAEO or the Alternate DAEO shall grant approval only on a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including part 2635 of this title, or paragraph (d) of this section. The DAEO or the Alternate DAEO will advise the employee, in writing, of the approval or denial of the request for outside employment and will maintain a record of the written request and determination.
