####### Billing unit

is a subdivision of the tribal employer's workforce that aligns tribal employees for purposes of administering FEHB enrollment and collection of payment. A billing unit may be either governmental or commercial or a combination of both. So long as a tribal employer purchases FEHB for at least one billing unit that is an Indian Tribe or tribal organization carrying out at least one program under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) or Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 (TCSA), or an urban Indian organization carrying out at least one program under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), the tribal employer may purchase FEHB for other billing units without regard to its programs.
