####### Agency discretion.

(2)In establishing its lists, an agency may, but is not required to: Afford priority consideration to non-preference eligibles who meet the conditions set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; afford priority consideration under paragraph (b) of this section for a longer time and/or in a broader geographic area than the minimum requirement; and/or provide reemployment consideration after the priority list is exhausted to additional current and former employees in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An agency may limit consideration granted at its discretion to applicants for specific positions or applicants who meet specific conditions, but must make those conditions a matter of record and must apply its policy uniformly to all eligible employees. Generally, full-time employees may be considered only for full-time positions and other-than-full-time employees only for other-than-full-time positions. However, full-time employees may be considered for other-than-full-time positions if there are no other-than-full-time employees on the appropriate priority or reemployment list; and other-than-full time employees may be considered for full-time positions if there are no full-time employees on the appropriate list.
