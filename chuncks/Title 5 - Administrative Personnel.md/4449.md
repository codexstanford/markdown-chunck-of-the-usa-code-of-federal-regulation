####### Periods of service for which refunded deductions have not been redeposited, and periods of civilian service performed on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken.

(b)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a period of service for which refunded deductions have not been redeposited, and a period of creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken, shall be included in determining length of service to compute the annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, only if-

(1) The employee or Member subsequently becomes eligible for an annuity payable under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code; and

(2) The employee, Member, or survivor makes a deposit (or redeposit) for the full period of service. If more than one distinct period of service is covered by a single refund, the periods of service covered by that refund are considered to be single full periods of service. However, in all other instances, a distinct period of nondeduction civilian service (i.e., a period of nondeduction service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) and a distinct period of redeposit civilian service (i.e., a period of redeposit service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) are considered as separate full periods of service, even when they are immediately consecutive. A period of nondeduction service which begins before October 1, 1982, and ends on or after that date is also considered two full periods of service: one ending on September 30, 1982, and the other beginning on October 1, 1982.

(c)(1)(i) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation before October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before October 1, 1990, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, provided the nondisability annuity commences after December 1, 1990; and

(ii) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation on or after October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before March 1, 1991, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code.

(2) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a retiree whose annuity includes service credited in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to the redeposit owed, or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the retiree's attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced monthly rate will then be rounded down to the next lower dollar amount and becomes the rate of annuity payable.

(3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the term "present value factor" has the same meaning as defined in ยง 831.603 and "time of retirement" has the same meaning as defined in ยง 831.2202.
