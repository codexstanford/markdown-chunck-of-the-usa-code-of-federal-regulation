###### ยง 2635.606 Recusal based on an arrangement concerning prospective employment or otherwise after negotiations.
####### Offer rejected or not made.

(b)The agency designee for the purpose of ยง 2635.502(c) may, in an appropriate case, determine that an employee not covered by the preceding paragraph who has sought but is no longer seeking employment nevertheless will be subject to a period of recusal upon the conclusion of employment negotiations. Any such determination will be based on a consideration of all the relevant factors, including those listed in ยง 2635.502(d), and a determination that the concern that a reasonable person may question the integrity of the agency's decision-making process outweighs the Government's interest in the employee's participation in the particular matter.
