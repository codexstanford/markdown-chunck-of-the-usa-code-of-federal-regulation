(B) Intermittent service on or after July 1, 1962, is counted as 1 day for each day an employee is in pay status, regardless of the number of hours for which the employee is actually paid on a given day. Agencies should consult the "260-Day Work Year Chart" in OPM'sto convert intermittent days worked to calendar time. The service requirement may not be satisfied in less than 3 years of calendar time.
