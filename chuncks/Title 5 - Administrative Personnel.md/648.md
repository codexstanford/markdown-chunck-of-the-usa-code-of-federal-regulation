###### ยง 297.501 Exemptions.
####### Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Case Records (OPM/CENTRAL-8).

(4)In this subpart, the Office has claimed exemptions for its other systems of records where it felt such exemptions are appropriate and necessary. These exemptions are claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7). During the processing of a Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act request (which may include access requests, amendment requests, and requests for review for initial denials of such requests) exempt materials from those other systems may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems are entered into this system, the Office hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those other systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary system of which they are a part.
