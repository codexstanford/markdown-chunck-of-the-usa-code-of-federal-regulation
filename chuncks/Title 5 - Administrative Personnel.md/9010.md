means that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld, excluding any garnishment under 5 CFR parts 581, 582. The Board will include the following deductions in determining disposable pay subject to salary offset:

(1) Federal Social Security and Medicare taxes;

(2) Federal, state, or local income taxes, but no more than would be the case if the employee claimed all dependents to which he or she is entitled and any additional amounts for which the employee presents evidence of a tax obligation supporting the additional withholding;

(3) Health insurance premiums;

(4) Normal retirement contributions as explained in 5 CFR 581.105(e);

(5) Normal life insurance premiums, excluding optional life insurance premiums; and

(6) Levies pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).
