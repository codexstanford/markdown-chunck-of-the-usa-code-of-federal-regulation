##### Subpart G - Job Grading Reviews and Appeals
###### ยง 532.701 General.

A prevailing rate employee may at any time appeal the occupational series, grade, or title to which the employee's job is assigned, but may not appeal under this subpart the standards established for the job, nor other matters such as the accuracy of the job description, the rate of pay, or the propriety of a wage schedule rate. The filing of a job-grading appeal does not negate any other appeal or grievance rights which may be available under applicable law, rule, regulation, or negotiated agreement.
