###### ยง 630.308 Scheduling of annual leave.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and ยง 630.310, before annual leave forfeited under 5 U.S.C. 6304 may be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year.

(b) The requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an employee who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). When coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) terminates during a leave year, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to comply with the scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of the agency or his or her designee may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if coverage under 6304(d)(3) terminated during the leave year and the employee was unable to comply with the advance scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control.
