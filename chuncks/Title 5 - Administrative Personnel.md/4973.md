(b)-(1)If, on separation from a period of reemployment during which the disability annuity was terminated because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity, the former disability annuitant is entitled to either an immediate or deferred annuity based on the most recent separation, any right to an annuity based on a prior separation is permanently extinguished. If no such right to immediate or deferred annuity accrues based on this most recent separation, however, any right to immediate or deferred annuity will be determined on the basis of the next prior separation.
