In the event the Shredder Room is not manned, do not leave burn bags outside the Shredder Room as the security of that material may be compromised.

(3) Responsibility for the security of the burn bag remains with the OMB office until it is handed over to the authorized representative at the shredder room. Accountability records will be adjusted after the burn bags have been delivered. Destruction actions will be recorded on OMB Form 87 by the division TSCO or by the appropriate ATSCO at the time the destruction is accomplished or at the time the burn bag is delivered to the U.D. Officer.
