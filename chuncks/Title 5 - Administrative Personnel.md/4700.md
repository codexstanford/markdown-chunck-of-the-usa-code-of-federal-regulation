####### Notice.

(a)Except as provided in ยง 831.1305, OPM will, before starting collection, tell the debtor in writing-

(1) The reason for and the amount of the debt;

(2) The date on which the full payment is due;

(3) OPM's policy on interest, penalties, and administrative charges;

(4) If payment in full would create financial hardship to the debtor and offset is available, the types of payment(s) to be offset, the repayment schedule, the right to request an adjustment in the repayment schedule and the right to request a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of offset;

(5) The individual's right to inspect and/or receive a copy of the Government's records relating to the debt;

(6) The method and time period (30 calendar days) for requesting reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise and, in the case of offset, an adjustment to the repayment schedule;

(7) The standards used by OPM for determining entitlement to waiver and compromise;

(8) The right to a hearing by the Merit Systems Protection Board on a waiver request (if OPM's waiver decision finds the individual liable) in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

(9) The fact that a timely filing of a request for reconsideration, waiver and/or compromise, or a later timely appeal of a waiver denial to the Merit Systems Protection Board, will stop collection proceedings, unless (i) failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of these procedures.
