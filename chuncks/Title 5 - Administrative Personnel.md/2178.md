###### Using a Highest Previous Rate Under the Maximum Payable Rate Rule
####### ยง 531.221 Maximum payable rate rule.
######## When highest previous rate is based on a GS rate or LEO special base rate.

(b)When an employee's highest previous rate (as determined under ยง 531.222) is based on a GS rate or an LEO special base rate paid under the GS pay system, an agency must determine the maximum payable rate of basic pay that may be paid to the employee as follows:

(1) Compare the employee's highest previous rate with the GS rates for the grade in which pay is currently being set. For this comparison, use the schedule of GS rates in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. In applying this paragraph to an employee who was a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate when the highest previous rate was earned, compare the highest previous rate to the applicable LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates if the grade in which pay is currently being set is one of the grades from GS-3 through GS-10.
