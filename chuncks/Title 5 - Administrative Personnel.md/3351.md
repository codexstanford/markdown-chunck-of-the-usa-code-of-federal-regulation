####### i.e.

(d) The service agreement must include the conditions under which the agency must terminate the service agreement before the employee completes the agreed-upon service period (, if an employee is demoted or separated for cause, receives a rating of record of less than "Fully Successful" or equivalent, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement) under § 575.311. The service agreement must specify the effect of a termination, including the conditions under which the agency will pay an additional retention incentive payment for partially completed service under § 575.311(e) and (f).

(e) The service agreement may include any other terms or conditions that, if violated, will result in a termination of the service agreement under § 575.311(b). For example, the service agreement may specify the employee's work schedule, type of position, and the duties he or she is expected to perform. In addition, the service agreement may address the extent to which periods of time on detail, in a nonpay status, or in paid leave status are creditable towards the completion of the service period.

(f) A written service agreement is not required if the agency-

(1) Pays the retention incentive in biweekly installments; and

(2) Sets each biweekly installment payment at the full retention incentive percentage rate established for the employee under § 575.309(a).
