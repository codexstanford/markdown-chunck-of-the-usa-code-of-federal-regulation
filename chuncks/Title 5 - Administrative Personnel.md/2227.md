####### Waiver of requirement for determination.

(d)(1) An acceptable level of competence determination shall be waived and a within-grade increase granted when an employee has not served in any position for the minimum period under an applicable agency performance appraisal program during the final 52 calendar weeks of the waiting period for one or more of the following reasons:

(i) Because of absences that are creditable service in the computation of a waiting period or periods under ยง 531.406 of this subpart;

(ii) Because of paid leave;

(iii) Because the employee received service credit under the back pay provisions of subpart H of part 550 of this chapter;

(iv) Because of details to another agency or employer for which no rating has been prepared;

(v) Because the employee has had insufficient time to demonstrate an acceptable level of competence due to authorized activities of official interest to the agency not subject to appraisal under part 430 of this chapter (including, but not limited to, labor-management partnership activities under section 2 of Executive Order 12871 and serving as a representative of a labor organization under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code); or

(vi) Because of long-term training.

(2) When an acceptable level of competence determination has been waived and a within-grade increase granted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, there shall be a presumption that the employee would have performed at an acceptable level of competence had the employee performed the duties of his or her position of record for the minimum period under the applicable agency performance appraisal program.
