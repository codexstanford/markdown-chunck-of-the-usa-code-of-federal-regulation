####### Proration factor

means a fraction expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest percent. The numerator is the sum of the number of hours the employee actually worked during part-time service, and the denominator is the sum of the number of hours that a full-time employee would be schedule to work during the same period of service included in the numerator. If an employee has creditable service in addition to part-time service (full-time service, intermittent service, or temporary service performed on a full-time basis), such service must be included in the numerator and denominator of the fraction. In general, this is done by including the number of days of such intermittent service, multiplied by 8, and the number of weeks of such temporary service or full-time service, multiplied by 40 in both the numerator and the denominator. The additional credit for unused sick leave under 5 U.S.C. 8339(m) is not included in the fraction.
