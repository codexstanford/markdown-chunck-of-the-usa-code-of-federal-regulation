####### Setting pay following a break in SES service,General.

(i)-(1)Upon reappointment to the SES, an authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of a former senior executive at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitations in ยง 534.403(a), if there has been a break in SES service of more than 30 days. If there has been a break in SES service of 30 days or less, the senior executive's rate of basic pay may be set at any rate within the SES rate range (without regard to whether the employee received a pay adjustment during the previous 12-month period), but not higher than the senior executive's former SES rate of basic pay. Where there has been a break in service of 30 days or less, the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) and (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) may approve a higher rate than the senior executive's former rate of basic pay, if warranted. Setting a rate of basic pay upon reappointment to the SES is considered a pay adjustment under ยง 534.404(c).
