###### ยง 575.301 Purpose.

This subpart contains regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5754, which authorizes payment of retention incentives. An agency may pay a retention incentive to a current employee under the conditions specified in this subpart when an agency determines that the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the agency for the employee's services makes it essential to retain the employee and that the employee would be likely to leave in the absence of an incentive.
