####### Leave usage.

(f)(1) An agency may not require an employee to use annual leave or sick leave to the employee's credit as a condition to be met before the employee uses paid parental leave. An employee may request to use annual leave or sick leave without invoking FMLA unpaid leave under subpart L of this part, and, in that case, the agency exercises its normal authority with respect to approving or disapproving the timing of when the leave may be used.

(2) Paid parental leave may be used in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement only during the 12-month period following birth or placement. (See ยง 630.1703(b).) Paid parental leave may not be used prior to the birth or placement involved even if the employee was granted FMLA unpaid leave under ยง 630.1203(a)(1) or (2) for periods prior to the birth or placement event, as allowed under ยง 630.1203(d).

(3) An employee with a seasonal work schedule may not use paid parental leave during the off-season period designated by the agency-the period during which the employee is scheduled to be released from work and placed in nonpay status.
