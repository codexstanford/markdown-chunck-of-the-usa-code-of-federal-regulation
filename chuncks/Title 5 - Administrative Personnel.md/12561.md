###### ยง 9701.342 Performance pay increases.
####### Performance point values.

(c)(1) DHS will establish point values that correspond to the performance rating levels established under subpart D of this part, so that a point value is attached to each rating level. For example, in a four-level rating program, the point value pattern could be 4-2-1-0, where 4 points are assigned to the highest (outstanding) rating and 0 points to an unacceptable rating. Performance point values will determine performance pay increases.

(2) DHS will establish a point value pattern for each pay pool. Different pay pools may have different point value patterns.

(3) DHS must assign zero performance points to an unacceptable rating of record.
