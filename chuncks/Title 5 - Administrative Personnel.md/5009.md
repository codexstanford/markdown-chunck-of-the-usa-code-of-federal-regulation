####### Collection of erroneously paid retirement benefits.

(c)(1) If OPM determines that an overpayment of annuity or lump-sum credit has occurred and the employee is entitled to receive back pay because of the canceled separation, the overpaid retirement benefits must be deducted to the extent they can be recovered from the back pay adjustment as required by ยง 550,805(e) of this chapter.

(2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8346(b) or 8470(b). If there is no back pay or the back pay is insufficient to recover the entire payment, the employee may request that OPM waive the uncollected portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the erroneous payment.
