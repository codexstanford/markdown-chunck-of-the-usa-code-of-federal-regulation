(ii) A beneficiary asset transfer;

(iii) A required minimum distribution;

(iv) An automatic cash out distribution; or

(2) The amount of the forced transfer shall be equal to the amount of the insufficiency described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, plus $1,000; except, however, that if the participant's mutual fund window account balance is less than $25,000, the entire mutual fund window account balance shall be transferred to the TSP core funds;

(3) Forced transfers shall be liquidated from the participant's mutual fund window account first from amounts held in the sweep money market fund; and then from amounts invested in mutual funds, beginning with the position with the highest balance;

(4) Forced transfers from a participant's mutual fund window account to the TSP core funds shall be invested according to the participant's existing contribution allocation; and

(5) The participant shall be responsible for any fees incurred as a result of the forced transfer.
