###### § 534.404 Setting and adjusting pay for senior executives.
####### Adjusting the pay of SES members.

(b)(1) An authorized agency official may adjust (increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive consistent with the agency's plan for setting and adjusting SES rates of basic pay under paragraph (g) of this section.

(2) A senior executive who receives an annual summary rating of outstanding performance must be considered for an annual pay increase, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.403(a).

(3) An agency may provide a pay increase to allow a senior executive to advance his or her relative position within the SES rate range only upon a determination by the authorized agency official that the senior executive's individual performance and/or contributions to agency performance so warrant. In assessing a senior executive's performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance, the authorized agency official may consider such things as unique skills, qualifications, or competencies that the individual possesses, and their significance to the agency's performance, as well as the senior executive's current responsibilities. Senior executives who demonstrate the highest levels of individual performance and/or make the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan, must receive the highest rates of basic pay or pay adjustments.

(4)(i) On the effective date of an increase in the minimum or maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range under § 534.403(a)(1) or (2), an authorized agency official may increase the rate of basic pay of a senior executive who meets or exceeds his or her performance expectations by an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the senior executive's relative position in the SES rate range, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A pay increase made under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).

(ii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is at or below the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if such an increase would cause the senior executive's rate of basic pay to exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay.

(iii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay. However, in the case of a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule and who has been rated below outstanding, but above fully successful, for the most recently completed appraisal period, the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) may approve such a pay increase in limited circumstances, such as for an exceptionally meritorious accomplishment.

(5) A senior executive who receives a summary rating of less than fully successful may not receive an increase in pay for the current appraisal period.

(6) An authorized agency official may reduce the rate of basic pay of a senior executive for performance and/or disciplinary reasons, consistent with the restrictions on reducing the rate of basic pay of a career senior executive in paragraph (j) of this section and in § 534.406(b).
