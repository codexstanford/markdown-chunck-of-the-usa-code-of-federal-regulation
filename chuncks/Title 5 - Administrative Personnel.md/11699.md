## Chapter XXVI - Department of Defense
### PART 3601 - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
#### ยง 3601.105 Disclaimer for teaching, speaking, and writing in a personal capacity related to official duties.
##### Example 2 to ยง 3601.105

[Disclaimer Not Required]: An employee is invited in his personal capacity to speak at his alma mater on Career Day about his personal experiences as a Government employee, but will not discuss the ongoing or announced policy, program, or operation of his agency. The introduction to his talk only mentions that he is a graduate of the school and currently a "DoD employee," but does not use his official title, rank, or position. No disclaimer would be necessary because the introduction to the employee's speech did not include his official title or position and the subject of the speech does not deal in significant part with any ongoing or announced policy, program or operation of the relevant DoD agency.
