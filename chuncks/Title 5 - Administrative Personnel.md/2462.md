####### i.e.

(2) If there is an increase in the rates of pay for the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 after an agency has already granted pay increases to its senior executives following the applicable performance appraisal period, an agency may review any previous determination to increase the pay of a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is equivalent to the rate for level II (if covered under a performance appraisal system that is certified) or level III (if covered under a performance appraisal system that is not certified) when the applicable maximum rate is increased to determine whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for the senior executive based on the same criteria used for the previous determination. The determination to provide an additional pay increase must be approved and made effective as of the effective date of increases in the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 (, the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1). An additional pay increase under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying ยง 534.404(c).
