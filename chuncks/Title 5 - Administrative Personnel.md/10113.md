####### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of the agency's reply is to inform the Authority and the exclusive representative whether and why it disagrees with any facts or arguments made for the first time in the exclusive representative's response. As more fully explained in paragraph (c) of this section, the Agency is required in the reply to, among other things, provide the reasons why the proposal or provision does not fit within any exceptions to management rights that were asserted by the exclusive representative in its response, and to explain why severance of the proposal or provision is not appropriate.
