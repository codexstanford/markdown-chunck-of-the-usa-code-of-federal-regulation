(3) During a period of leave without pay, if the employee is in receipt of benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 8101). (Note: No premium pay is payable during leave without pay; however, the continued authorization may prevent a reduction in an employee's retirement benefits if the leave without pay period occurs during the employee's high-3 average salary period.)

(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an agency may continue to pay premium pay under ยง 550.151 to an employee during a temporary assignment that would not otherwise warrant the payment of AUO pay, if the temporary assignment is directly related to a national emergency declared by the President. An agency may continue to pay premium pay under ยง 550.151 for not more than 30 consecutive workdays for such a temporary assignment and for a total of not more than 90 workdays in a calendar year while on such a temporary assignment.
