######## Percentage bonus method.,i.e.,

(3)An agency may establish a nondiscretionary bonus as a fixed percentage of total pay (pre-bonus total remuneration, including straight time pay for any overtime hours, plus any half-rate overtime pay under ยง 551.512(a)(2)) to be earned by the employee during a future period of service. This method may not be used to circumvent any bonus limitations that might otherwise apply. At the agency's discretion, the portion of the bonus attributable to the employee's half-rate overtime pay under ยง 551.512(a)(2) may be excluded in applying bonus limitations, since it can be viewed as constituting additional FLSA overtime pay. (This method does not apply to nondiscretionary bonuses established as a percentage of a segment of pay, such as ratings-based cash awards under ยง 451.104(g) of this chapter that are expressed as a percentage of basic pay, excluding locality adjustments. To meet overtime pay requirements for these types of bonuses, use one of the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.)
