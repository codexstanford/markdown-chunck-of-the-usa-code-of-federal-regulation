###### Use of record exclusions.

(d)A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request. In the event that IPEC identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), IPEC will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion, and IPEC will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.
