The effective direction by supervisors and the alert performance of duty by employees will do much to ensure the adequate security of classified information in the possession of OMB offices. Each employee has a responsibility to protect and account for all classified information that he/she knows of within his/her area of responsibility. Such information will be made available only to those persons who have an official need to know and who have been granted the appropriate security clearance. Particular care must be taken not to discuss classified information over unprotected communications circuits (to include intercom and closed-circuit TV), at non-official functions, or at any time that it might be revealed to unauthorized persons. Classified information may only be entered into computer systems meeting the appropriate security criteria.
