### PART 9901 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS AND INFORMATION
#### Freedom of Information Act
##### ยง 9901.8 Fees.
###### Waiver of fees.

(d)MCRMC shall waive all or part of any fee provided for in this subpart where the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and the records sought are not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a fee waiver must explain how the information requested contributes to the public interest. In determining whether a fee should be waived, the FOIA Officer shall consider whether the requester has demonstrated that:

(1) The subject matter of the request specifically concerns identifiable operations or activities of the Government;

(2) The information is already in the public domain;

(3) Disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; and

(4) Disclosure of the information would significantly enhance the public's understanding of the subject matter.
