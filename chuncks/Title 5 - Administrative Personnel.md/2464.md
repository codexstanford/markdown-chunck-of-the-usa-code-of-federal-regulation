###### ยง 534.404 Setting and adjusting pay for senior executives.
####### Setting pay upon transfer.

(h)(1) An authorized agency official may set the pay of a senior executive transferring from another agency at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in ยง 534.403(a) and the restrictions on reducing the pay of career senior executives in paragraph (h)(2) of this section (upon transfer to an agency whose applicable performance appraisal system is not certified) and in ยง 534.406(b) (for 12 months following the effective date of the new SES pay system). If pay is set at the same SES rate the senior executive received in his or her former agency, the action is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying ยง 534.404(c).

(2) A senior executive whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay as a result of transferring to an agency where the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SES rate range is equal to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The senior executive will continue to receive his or her current SES rate and is not eligible for a pay adjustment until the senior executive is assigned to a position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or the employing agency's applicable performance appraisal system is certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363 and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.
