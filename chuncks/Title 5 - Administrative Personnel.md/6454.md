###### ยง 890.101 Definitions; time computations.
####### Underdeduction

means a failure to withhold the required amount of health benefits contributions from an individual's pay, annuity, or compensation. This definition includes both nondeductions (when none of the required amounts was withheld) and partial deductions (when only part of the required amount was withheld). Though FEHB contributions are required to cover a period of nonpay status, the nonpayment of contributions during such period does not result in an underdeduction.

(b) Whenever, in this part, a period of time is stated as a number of days or a number of days from an event, the period is computed in calendar days, excluding the day of the event. Whenever, in this part, a period of time is defined by beginning and ending dates, the period includes the beginning and ending dates.
