###### ยง 875.209 How do I demonstrate that I am eligible to apply for coverage?

(a) When you submit your application for coverage, you must make known your status as a member of an eligible group. If you are a qualified relative, you need to provide identifying information about the workforce member who makes you an eligible individual.

(b) If the Carrier finds that you misrepresented your eligibility status, the Carrier has the right to void your coverage and return to you any premiums you paid, without interest. The incontestability provisions in ยง 875.408 do not apply to this section.
