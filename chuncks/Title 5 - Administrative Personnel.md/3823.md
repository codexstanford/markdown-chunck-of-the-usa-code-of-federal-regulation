###### ยง 630.1010 Termination of medical emergency.

(a) The medical emergency affecting a leave recipient shall terminate-

(1) When the leave recipient's Federal service terminates;

(2) When the leave recipient leaves the agency or participating organizational subunit, if the bank board so determines;

(3) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the leave bank board receives written notice from the leave recipient or from a personal representative of the leave recipient that the leave recipient is no longer affected by a medical emergency;

(4) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the leave bank board determines, after written notice from the bank board and an opportunity for the leave recipient (or, if appropriate, a personal representative of the leave recipient) to answer orally or in writing, that the leave recipient is no longer affected by a medical emergency; or

(5) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the agency receives notice that the Office of Personnel Management has approved an application for disability retirement for the leave recipient under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System.

(b) The leave bank board shall ensure that annual leave withdrawn from the leave bank and not used before the termination of a leave recipient's medical emergency shall be returned to the leave bank.

(c) The leave bank board may deem a medical emergency to continue for the purpose of providing a leave recipient an adequate period of time within which to receive contributions of annual leave.

(d) If a leave recipient elects to buy back annual leave as a result of a claim for an employment-related injury approved by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs under 20 CFR 10.202 and 10.310, the amount of annual leave withdrawn from the leave bank that is bought back by the leave recipient shall be restored to the leave bank.
