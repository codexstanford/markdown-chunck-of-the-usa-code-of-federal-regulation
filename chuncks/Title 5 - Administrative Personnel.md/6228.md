####### Duly appointed representative of the insured's estate

means an individual named in a court order granting the individual the authority to receive, or the right to possess, the insured's property; the order must be issued by a court having jurisdiction over the insured's estate. Where the law of the insured's legal residence provides for the administration of estates through alternative procedures which do away with the need for a court order, this term also means an individual who shows that he/she is entitled to receive, or possess, the insured's property under the terms of those alternative procedures.
