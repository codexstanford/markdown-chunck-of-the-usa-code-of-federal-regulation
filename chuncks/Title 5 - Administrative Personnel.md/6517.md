####### Survivor annuitants.

(d)(1)If an employee who is entitled to health benefits coverage as a survivor annuitant elects to enroll or to continue to be enrolled under his eligibility as an employee, and is thereafter separated without entitlement to continued enrollment based on his own service, he is entitled to reinstatement of his employee-acquired enrollment on application to his retirement office. Reinstatement is effective immediately after termination of his employee-acquired enrollment if the application is received by the retirement office within 60 days of separation; otherwise reinstatement is effective on the first day of the first pay period after receipt of the application. The retirement office shall withhold from the annuity that the former employee receives as a survivor annuitant, the amounts necessary to pay his share of the cost of the enrollment.
