###### Subsequent action.

(d)(1) If either the MRP or MSPB sustains an employee's appeal based on a finding that the employee did not commit an MRO, the Department is not precluded from subsequently proposing an adverse action (other than an MRO) based on the same record evidence. Such a proposal must be issued-

(i) In accordance with applicable law and regulation, including the procedures set forth in ยง 9701.609; and

(ii) Normally within 15 days after the date of MSPB's decision, unless the Department establishes good cause for exceeding this time limit.

(2) Nothing in this section precludes the Department from taking a subsequent action against an employee based, in part, on additional evidence that was not part of the record in the initial proceeding before the MRP.
