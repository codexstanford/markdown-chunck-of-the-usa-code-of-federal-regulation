####### C. Present value.

1. Orders that award a portion of the "present value" of an annuity will not be honored unless the amount of the "present value" is stated in the order. (See 5 CFR 838.1004(b).)

2. Orders that award a portion of the "present value" of an annuity stated in the order will be interpreted as awarding "a specific dollar amount." Unless the court specifically states otherwise, such an award payable from a monthly annuity benefit will be paid in equal installments at 50 percent of the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.

3. Orders that award a portion of the "value" of an annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without specifying what "value" is, will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of "creditable service" or service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the total number of months as of the time of retirement of "creditable service" or service worked, whichever term is used in the court order. (See III. C. of these Guidelines.)

4. Orders that contain general language awarding a specified portion of a Federal employee's "retirement benefits" as of a specified date before retirement, but do not specify whether OPM should use "creditable service" or "service worked" as of the date specified to complete the computation, will be interpreted to award a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the number of months of "creditable service" as of the time of retirement.
