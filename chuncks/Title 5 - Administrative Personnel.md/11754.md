For loans retained pursuant to this paragraph, a covered employee shall submit to his or her immediate supervisor, the ethics liaison in his or her office, and the DAEO, a written disqualification from examining, auditing, visiting, reviewing, investigating, or otherwise participating in the supervision of the System institution that is providing the retained credit. Written disqualification shall be made within 30 days of appointment to a covered employee position on a form prescribed by the DAEO. Any renewal or renegotiation of a pre-existing loan or extension of credit will be treated as a new loan subject to the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
