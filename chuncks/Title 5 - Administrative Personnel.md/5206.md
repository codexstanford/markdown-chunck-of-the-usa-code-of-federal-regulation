####### Retiree

means a former employee or Member who is receiving, or meets the statutory age and service requirements for, an annuity under either CSRS or FERS. This includes individuals who meet the statutory requirements for benefits and chose to postpone the beginning date of the annuity under ยง 842.204(c) or ยง 842.212(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter (pertaining to FERS MRA+10 and FERS deferred benefits). Retiree does not include a current spouse, former spouse, child, or person with an insurable interest receiving a survivor annuity. An individual who has left Federal service after completing 5 years of service but has not reached the age at which annuity payments may begin is considered a "separated employee" rather than a retiree.
