(b)A covered employee who holds a license related to real estate, appraisals, securities, or insurance and whose official duties with the Corporation require personal and substantial involvement in matters related to, respectively, real estate, appraisal, securities, or insurance is prohibited from using such license, other than in the performance of his or her official duties, for the production of income.
