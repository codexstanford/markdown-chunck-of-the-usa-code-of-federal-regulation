###### Generally.

(a)MCRMC will apply a presumption of openness when processing FOIA requests and will only withhold exempt information if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the statutory exemptions or if disclosure is prohibited by law. Before withholding information, MCRMC will conduct a foreseeable harm analysis, which clearly identifies the harm that would occur with disclosure.
