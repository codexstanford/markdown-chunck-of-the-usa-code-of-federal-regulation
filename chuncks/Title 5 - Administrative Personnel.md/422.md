###### ยง 230.402 Agency authority to make emergency-indefinite appointments in a national emergency.
####### Basic authority.

(b)Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appointments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM's approval to make emergency-indefinite appointments without a declared national emergency when the President has authorized the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must make emergency-indefinite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available eligibles.
