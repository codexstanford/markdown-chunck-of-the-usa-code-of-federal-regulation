##### ยง 1605.2 Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on late contributions and loan payments.
###### Posting of multiple contributions.

(e)If the TSP record keeper posts multiple makeup or late contributions or late loan payments with different "as of" dates for a participant on the same business day, the amount of breakage charged to the employing agency or forfeited to the TSP will be determined separately for each transaction, without netting any gains or losses attributable to different "as of" dates. In addition, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP core funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, breakage will be determined separately for each as-of date, TSP core fund, and source of contributions.
