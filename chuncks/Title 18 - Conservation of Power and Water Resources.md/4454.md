####### Restricted service list.

(d)(1) For purposes of eliminating unnecessary expense or improving administrative efficiency, the Secretary, an office director, or the presiding officer may establish, by order, a restricted service list for an entire proceeding, a phase of a proceeding, one or more issues in a proceeding, or one or more cases in a consolidated proceeding.

(2) Any restricted service list will contain the names of each person on the official service list, or the person's representative, who, in the judgment of the decisional authority establishing the list, is an active participant with respect to the proceeding or consolidated proceeding, any phase of the proceeding, or any issue in the proceeding, for which the list is established.

(3) Any restricted service list is maintained in the same manner as, and in addition to, the official service list under paragraph (c) of this section.

(4) Before any restricted service list is established, each person included on the official service list will be given notice of any proposal to establish a restricted service list and an opportunity to show why that person should also be included on the restricted service list or why a restricted service list should not be established.

(5) Any designation of a person for service on a restricted service list may be changed by filing written notice with the Commission and serving that notice on each person whose name is on the applicable restricted service list.
