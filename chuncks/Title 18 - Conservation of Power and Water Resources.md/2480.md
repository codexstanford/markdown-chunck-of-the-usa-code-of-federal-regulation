(a)-Gas stored during the year must be priced at cost according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities of the utility used in moving the gas to the storage area and expenses of storage facilities cannot be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized or directed by the Commission.

Withdrawals of gas must be priced using the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method, provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and appropriate inventory records are maintained. Approval of the Commission must be obtained for any other pricing method, or change in the pricing method adopted by the utility.

Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses.
