##### Delayed items.

1-5Ordinary delayed items and adjustments arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustments made in the year to which it pertained. When the amount of a delayed item or adjustment is relatively so large that its inclusion in net income for a single month would seriously distort the accounts for the month (but not for the year), such amount may be distributed in equal monthly charges or credits, as the case may be, to the remaining months of the calendar year. See instruction 1-6 for instructions covering extraordinary and prior period items of a nonrecurring nature.
