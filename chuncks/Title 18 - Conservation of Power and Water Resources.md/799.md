###### ยง 11.11 Energy gains method of determining headwater benefits charges.
####### Calculation; headwater benefits formula.

(2)The annual headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is derived by multiplying the section 10(f) cost by the ratio of the energy gains received by the downstream project to the sum of total energy gains received by all downstream projects (except those projects specified in ยง 11.10(b) of this chapter) plus the energy generated at the headwater project that is assigned to the joint-use power cost, as follows:

(3) If power generation is not a function of the headwater project, section 10(f) costs will be apportioned only among the downstream projects.

(4) If the headwater project is constructed after the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which any energy losses at the downstream project due to filling the headwater reservoir have been offset by subsequent energy gains. If the headwater project is constructed prior to the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which benefits are first realized by the downstream project.
