####### For Federal headwater projects.

(b)(1) If the headwater project was constructed or is operated by the United States, and the Commission has not approved a settlement between the downstream project owner and the headwater project owner, the section 10(f) cost will be determined by deriving, from information provided by the headwater project owner pursuant to ยง 11.16 of this subpart, the joint-use power cost and the portion of the annual joint-use power cost that represents the interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the project.

(2) If power is not an authorized function of the headwater project, the section 10(f) cost is the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation portion of the headwater project costs designated as the joint-use power cost, derived by deeming a power function at the project. The value of the benefits assigned to the deemed power function, for purposes of determining the value of remaining benefits of the joint-use power cost, is the total value of downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.
