####### Fuel conversion facility

(3)means any addition to public utility plant that enables a natural gas-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, or that enables an oil-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, other than natural gas. Such facilities include those that alter internal plant workings, such as oil or coal burners, soot blowers, bottom ash removal systems and concomitant air pollution control facilities, and any facility needed for receiving and storing the fuel to which the plant is being converted, which facility would not be necessary if the plant continued to burn gas or oil.
