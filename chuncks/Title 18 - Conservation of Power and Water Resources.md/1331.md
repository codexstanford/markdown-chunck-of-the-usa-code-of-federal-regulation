###### ยง 35.24 Tax normalization for public utilities.
####### Reduction of, and addition to, rate base.

(2)(i) The rate base of a public utility using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property;" Account 282, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-other property;" and Account 283, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-other." Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, "Accumulated deferred income taxes," must be treated as an addition to rate base.

(ii) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction or other jurisdictional activities.

(iii) If a public utility uses an approved purchased gas adjustment clause or a research, development and demonstration tracking clause, the rate base reductions or additions required under this subparagraph must apply only to the extent that the balances in Account 190 and Accounts 281 through 283 are not used, for purposes of calculating carrying charges, as an offset to balances properly recordable in Account 188, "Research development and demonstration expenditures," or Account 191, "Unrecovered purchased gas costs."
