####### Forward looking allocation ratios.

(4)Every test period CWIP project requested for wholesale rate base treatment pursuant to § 35.26(c)(1), (2), and (3) of this part will be allocated to the customer classes on the basis of forward looking allocation ratios reflecting the anticipated average annual use the wholesale customers will make of the system over the estimated service life of the project. Supporting documentation, as required by §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, must be in sufficient detail to permit examination and verification of the forward looking allocation ratio's recognition of each wholesale customer's plans, if any, for future alternative or supplementary power supplies. For the purpose of preventing anticompetitive effects, including CWIP-induced price squeeze and double whammy, sufficient recognition of such plans may require the public utility applicant to provide for separate customer groups or provide for a rate design incorporating selected CWIP project credits.
