###### Cost-of-service rates.

(a)A carrier may change a rate pursuant to this section if it shows that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the carrier and the rate resulting from application of the index such that the rate at the ceiling level would preclude the carrier from being able to charge a just and reasonable rate within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. A carrier must substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by part 346 of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under ยง 342.3.
