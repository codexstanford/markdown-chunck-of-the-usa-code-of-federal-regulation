####### Exhibit A

(c)is a description of the project and the proposed mode of operation.

(1) The exhibit must include, in tabular form if possible, as appropriate:

(i) The number of generating units, including auxiliary units, the capacity of each unit, and provisions, if any, for future units;

(ii) The type of hydraulic turbine(s);

(iii) A description of how the plant is to be operated, manual or automatic, and whether the plant is to be used for peaking;

(iv) The estimated average annual generation in kilowatt-hours or mechanical energy equivalent;

(v) The estimated average head on the plant;

(vi) The reservoir surface area in acres and, if known, the net and gross storage capacity;

(vii) The estimated minimum and maximum hydraulic capacity of the plant (flow through the plant) in cubic feet per second and estimated average flow of the stream or water body at the plant or point of diversion; for projects with installed capacity of more than 1.5 megawatts, monthly flow duration curves and a description of the drainage area for the project site must be provided;

(viii) Sizes, capacities, and construction materials, as appropriate, of pipelines, ditches, flumes, canals, intake facilities, powerhouses, dams, transmission lines, and other appurtenances; and

(ix) The estimated cost of the project.

(x) The estimated capital costs and estimated annual operation and maintenance expense of each proposed environmental measure.

(2) State the purposes of project (for example, use of power output).

(3) An estimate of the cost to develop the license application; and

(4) The on-peak and off-peak values of project power, and the basis for estimating the values, for projects which are proposed to operate in a mode other than run-of-river.
