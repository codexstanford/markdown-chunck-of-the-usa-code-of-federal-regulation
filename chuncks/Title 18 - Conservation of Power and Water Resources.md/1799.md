## Chapter I - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Department of Energy
### Subchapter C - Accounts, Federal Power Act
#### PART 101 - UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS PRESCRIBED FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES AND LICENSEES SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL POWER ACT
##### Nonmajor,Major

B. This system applies to Major, Nonmajor, and Nonoperating utilities and licensees. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which, prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Class C and Class D) [part 104 of this chapter, now revoked]. The notations () and () have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the Major (previously Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden on the Nonmajor (previously Class C and Class D).

C. The class to which any utility or licensee belongs will originally be determined by its annual megawatt hours in each of the last three consecutive years, or in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made as necessary when the megawatt-hours for each of the three immediately preceding years shall exceed the upper limit, or be less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the utility.

D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.
