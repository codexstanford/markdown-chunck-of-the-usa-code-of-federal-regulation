(h)(1) The Commission may resolve complaints using Fast Track procedures if the complaint requires expeditious resolution. Fast Track procedures may include expedited action on the pleadings by the Commission, expedited hearing before an ALJ, or expedited action on requests for stay, extension of time, or other relief by the Commission or an ALJ.

(2) A complainant may request Fast Track processing of a complaint by including such a request in its complaint, captioning the complaint in bold type face "COMPLAINT REQUESTING FAST TRACK PROCESSING," and explaining why expedition is necessary as required by section 385.206(b)(11).
