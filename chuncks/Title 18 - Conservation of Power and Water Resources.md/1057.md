###### Existing generation facility,i.e.

(1)means a generation facility that is operational at or before the time the section 203 transaction is consummated. "The time the transaction is consummated" means the point in time when the transaction actually closes and control of the facility changes hands. "Operational" means a generation facility for which construction is complete (, it is capable of producing power). The Commission will rebuttably presume that section 203(a) applies to the transfer of any existing generation facility unless the utility can demonstrate with substantial evidence that the generator is used exclusively for retail sales.
