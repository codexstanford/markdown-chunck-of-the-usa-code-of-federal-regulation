(i)Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. The application must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site atwithin the time allowed (by ยง 11.20) for the payment of the annual charges. If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under ยง 11.21. If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.
