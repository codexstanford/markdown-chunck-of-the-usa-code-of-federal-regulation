####### Fish and wildlife recommendation

(ii)means any recommendation designed to protect, mitigate damages to, or enhance any wild member of the animal kingdom, including any migratory or nonmigratory mammal, fish, bird, amphibian, reptile, mollusk, crustacean, or other invertebrate, whether or not bred, hatched, or born in captivity, and includes any egg or offspring thereof, related breeding or spawning grounds, and habitat.
