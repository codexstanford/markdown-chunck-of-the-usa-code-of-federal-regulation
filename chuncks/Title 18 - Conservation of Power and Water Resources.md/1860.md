##### Training costs

(19)(Major and Nonmajor Utilities). When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.)
