(12)(i) Each independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions that allow distributed energy resource aggregations to participate directly in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets.

(ii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator, to accommodate the participation of distributed energy resource aggregations, must establish market rules that address:

(A) Eligibility to participate in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets through a distributed energy resource aggregation;

(B) Locational requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

(C) Distribution factors and bidding parameters for distributed energy resource aggregations;

(D) Information and data requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

(E) Modification to the list of resources in a distributed energy resource aggregation;

(F) Metering and telemetry system requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

(G) Coordination between the regional transmission organization or independent system operator, the distributed energy resource aggregator, the distribution utility, and the relevant electric retail regulatory authorities; and

(H) Market participation agreements for distributed energy resource aggregators.

(iii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must establish a minimum size requirement for distributed energy resource aggregations that does not exceed 100 kW.

(iv) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers to be bid into RTO/ISO markets by a distributed energy resource aggregator.
