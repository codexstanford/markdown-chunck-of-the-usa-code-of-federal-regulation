####### Rate of return.

(3)The rate of return is 5.77 percent through payment year 2025. The rate of return will be adjusted every 10 years thereafter, and will be based on the 10-year average of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the applicable NASS Census. For example, for years 2026 through 2035, the rate of return will be based on the 10-year average (2012-2021) of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the 2022 NASS Census. If the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate is not available, the next longest term Treasury bond available should be used in its place.
