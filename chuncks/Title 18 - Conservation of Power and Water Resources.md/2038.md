####### Reduction of, and addition to, Rate Base.

(c)(1) The rate base of an interstate pipeline using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property"; Account 282, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-other property": and Account 283, "Accumulated deferred income taxes-other." Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, "Accumulated deferred income taxes," must be treated as an addition to rate base. Include, as an addition or reduction, as appropriate, amounts in Account 182.3, Other regulatory assets, and Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities, that result from a deficiency or excess in the deferred tax accounts (see paragraph (d) of this section) and which have been, or are soon expected to be, authorized for recovery or refund through rates.

(2) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction, or other costs and revenues affecting jurisdictional cost-of-service.
