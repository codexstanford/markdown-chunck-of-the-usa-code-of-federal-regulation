(a)If the hearing is held before a "hearing officer" as defined in ยง 1307.11(b), that hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the TVA Board for a final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a hearing officer, the recipient may file with the TVA Board exceptions to the initial decision, which shall include a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice of initial decision. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within forty-five (45) days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that it will review the decision.

In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.
