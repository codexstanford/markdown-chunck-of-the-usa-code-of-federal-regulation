(b)Maximum rates for both peak and offpeak periods must be designed to achieve the following three objectives:

(1) Rates for service during peak periods should ration capacity;

(2) Rates for firm service during off-peak periods and for interruptible service during all periods should maximize throughput; and

(3) The pipeline's revenue requirement allocated to firm and interruptible services should be attained by providing the projected units of service in peak and off-peak periods at the maximum rate for each service.
