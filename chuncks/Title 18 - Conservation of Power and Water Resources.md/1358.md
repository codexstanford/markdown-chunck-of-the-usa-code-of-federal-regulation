####### Preliminary relief.

(2)(i) If an intervenor in its initial pleading alleges that a price squeeze will occur as a direct result of the public utility's request for CWIP pursuant to ยง 35.26(c)(3), makes a showing that it is likely to incur harm if such CWIP is allowed subject to refund, and makes a showing of how the harm to the intervenor would be mitigated or eliminated by the types of preliminary relief requested, the Commission will consider preliminary relief at the suspension stage of the case pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section. In determining whether to grant preliminary relief, the Commission will balance the following public interest considerations:

(A) The harm to the intervenor if it is not granted preliminary relief from the requested CWIP;

(B) The harm to the public utility if, during the interim period of preliminary relief, the public utility is required to recover its financing charges later through AFUDC rather than immediately through CWIP; and

(C) Mitigating bias against investment in new plants, ensuring accurate price signals, and fostering rate stability.

(ii) Whether or not preliminary relief is granted at the suspension stage will not preclude consideration of further interim or final remedies later in the proceedings, if warranted.

(3) If the Commission makes a final determination that a price squeeze due solely to allowance of a lower percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in the public utility's retail rate base than allowed by this Commission, the Commission will consider an adjustment to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in order to eliminate or mitigate the price squeeze.

(4) If an intervenor meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Commission, depending on the type of showing made including the likelihood, immediacy, and severity of any anticompetitive harm, may:

(i) Suspend the entire rate increase or all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP component for up to five months;

(ii) Allow all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP only prospectively from the issuance of the Commission's final order on rehearing on the matter; or

(iii) Take such other action as is proper under the circumstances.
