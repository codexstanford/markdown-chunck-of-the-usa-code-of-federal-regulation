(4) No interested person will make or knowingly cause to be made to the arbitrator an unauthorizedcommunication relevant to the merits of the proceeding, unless the participants agree otherwise. If a communication is made in violation of this prohibition, the arbitrator will ensure that a memorandum of the communication is prepared and made a part of the record, and that an opportunity for rebuttal is allowed. Upon receipt of such communication, the arbitrator may require the offending participant to show cause why the claim of the participant should not be resolved against the participant as a result of the improper conduct.

(5) The arbitrator will make the award within 30 days after the close of the hearing or the date of the filing of any briefs authorized by the arbitrator, whichever date is later, unless the participants and the arbitrator agree to some other time limit.
