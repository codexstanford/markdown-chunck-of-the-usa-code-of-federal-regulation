## Chapter I - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Department of Energy
### Subchapter E - Regulations Under Natural Gas Act
#### PART 154 - RATE SCHEDULES AND TARIFFS
##### Subpart E - Limited Rate Changes
###### ยง 154.403 Periodic rate adjustments.

(a) This section applies to the passthrough, on a periodic basis, of a single cost item or revenue item for which passthrough is not regulated under another section of this subpart, and to revisions on a periodic basis of a gas reimbursement percentage.

(b) Where a pipeline recovers fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas in kind, the fuel reimbursement percentage must be stated in the tariff either on the tariff sheet stating the currently effective rate or on a separate tariff sheet or section in such a way that it is clear what amount of natural gas must be tendered in kind for each service rendered.

(c) A natural gas company that passes through a cost or revenue item or adjusts its fuel reimbursement percentage under this section, must state within the general terms and conditions of its tariff, the methodology and timing of any adjustments. The following must be included in the general terms and conditions:

(1) A statement of the nature of the revenue or costs to be flowed through to the customer;

(2) A statement of the manner in which the cost or revenue will be collected or returned, whether through a surcharge, offset, or otherwise;

(3) A statement of which customers are recipients of the revenue credit and which rate schedules are subject to the cost or fuel reimbursement percentage;

(4) A statement of the frequency of the adjustment and the dates on which the adjustment will become effective;

(5) A step-by-step description of the manner in which the amount to be flowed through is calculated and a step-by-step description of the flowthrough mechanism, including how the costs are classified and allocated. Where the adjustment modifies a rate established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;

(6) Where costs or revenue credits are accumulated over a past period for periodic recovery or return, the past period must be defined and the mechanism for the recovery or return must be detailed on a step-by-step basis. Where the natural gas company proposes to use a surcharge to clear an account in which the difference between costs or revenues, recovered through rates, and actual costs and revenues accumulate, a statement must be included detailing, on a step-by-step basis, the mechanism for calculating the entries to the account and for passing through the account balance.

(7) Where carrying charges are computed, the calculations must be consistent with the methodology and reporting requirements set forth in ยง 154.501 using the carrying charge rate required by that section. A natural gas company must normalize all income tax timing differences which are the result of differences between the period in which expense or revenue enters into the determination of taxable income and the period in which the expense or revenue enters into the determination of pre-tax book income. Any balance upon which the natural gas company calculates carrying charges must be adjusted for any recorded deferred income taxes.

(8) Where the natural gas company discounts the rate component calculated pursuant to this section, explain on a step-by-step basis how the natural gas company will adjust for rate discounts in its methodology to reflect changes in costs under this section.

(9) If the costs passed through under a mechanism approved under this section are billed by an upstream natural gas company, explain how refunds received from upstream natural gas companies will be passed through to the natural gas company's customers, including the allocation and classification of such refunds;

(10) A step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to reflect changes in the fuel reimbursement percentage, including the allocation and classification of the fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas. Where the adjustment modifies a fuel reimbursement percentage established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;

(11) A statement of whether the difference between quantities actually used or lost and the quantities retained from the customers for fuel use and loss will be recovered or returned in a future surcharge. Include a step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to calculate such surcharge. Any period during which these differences accumulate must be defined.
