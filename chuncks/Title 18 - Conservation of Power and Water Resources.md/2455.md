##### Accounting for other comprehensive income.

22.

A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.

B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount.

C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost of service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains shall be recorded in accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.
