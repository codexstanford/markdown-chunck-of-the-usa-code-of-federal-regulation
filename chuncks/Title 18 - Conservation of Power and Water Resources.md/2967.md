####### Market Hub Price

(i) Ais a price established at a liquid market hub which a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility determines represents an appropriate measure of the electric utility's avoided cost for as-available energy, and is a hub to which the electric utility has reasonable access, based on an evaluation by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

(A) Whether the hub is sufficiently liquid that prices at the hub represent a competitive price;

(B) Whether prices developed at the hub are sufficiently transparent;

(C) Whether the electric utility has the ability to deliver power from such hub to its load, even if its load is not directly connected to the hub; and

(D) Whether the hub represents an appropriate market to derive an energy price for the electric utility's purchases from the relevant qualifying facility given the electric utility's physical proximity to the hub or other factors.
