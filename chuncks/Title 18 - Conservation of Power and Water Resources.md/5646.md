#### ยง 1309.14 How will complaints against recipients be processed?
##### Investigation.

(d)(1) TVA will make a prompt investigation whenever a complaint is unresolved within 60 days after it is filed with TVA or is reopened because of a violation of the mediation agreement. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with the Act and this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with the Act and this part.

(2) As part of the initial investigation, TVA shall use informal fact finding methods including joint or individual discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, to resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. TVA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

(3) If TVA cannot resolve the matter within 10 calendar days after the mediator returns the complaint, it shall complete the investigation, attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to TVA, if the investigation indicates a violation, and arrange for enforcement as described in ยง 1309.15, if necessary.
