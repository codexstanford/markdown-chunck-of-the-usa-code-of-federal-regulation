(d)A licensee may file a request with the Director of the Office of Energy Projects for a credit for contractual payments made for construction, operation, and maintenance of a Government dam at any time before 30 days after receiving a billing for annual charges determined under this section. The Director, or his designee, will grant such a credit only when the licensee demonstrates that a credit is reasonably justified.
