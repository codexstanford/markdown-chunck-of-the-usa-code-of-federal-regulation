###### Finding of no significant impact

(g)(FONSI) means a document by the Commission briefly presenting the reason why an action, not otherwise excluded by ยง 380.4, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared. It must include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and must note other environmental documents related to it. If the assessment is included, the FONSI need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may incorporate it by reference.
