#### Subpart B - Regulation of Floating Cabins
##### ยง 1304.100 Scope and intent.

This subpart prescribes requirements for floating cabins on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins as applied to this subpart include existing nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA and other existing structures, whose design and use is primarily for human habitation or occupation and not for navigation or transportation on the water. Floating cabins that were not located or moored on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed new floating cabins. New floating cabins are prohibited and subject to the removal provisions of this part and Section 9b of the TVA Act. No new floating cabins shall be moored, anchored, or installed on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins that were located or moored in the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, shall be deemed existing floating cabins. Existing floating cabins may remain moored on the Tennessee River System provided they remain in compliance with the rules in this part and obtain a permit from TVA issued after October 12, 2021. All permits for nonnavigable houseboats or floating cabins that were not located on the Tennessee River System as of December 16, 2016, are terminated. Unless otherwise noted, the term floating cabin refers to the primary structure on the monolithic frame as well as all attached structures.
