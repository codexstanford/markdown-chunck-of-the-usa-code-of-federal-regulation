###### Denial of coverage.

(d)The Executive Director will deny or revoke coverage under a general permit when one or more of the following conditions exist:

(1) The project or project sponsor does not or can no longer meet the criteria for coverage under a general permit.

(2) The diversion, withdrawal or consumptive use, individually or in combination with other similar Commission regulated activities, is causing or has the potential to cause adverse impacts to water resources or competing water users.

(3) The project does not comport with ยง 806.21(a) or (b).

(4) The project includes other diversions, withdrawals or consumptive uses that require an individual approval and the issuance of both an individual approval and a general permit for the project would constitute an undue administrative burden on the Commission.

(5) The Executive Director determines that a project cannot be effectively regulated under a general permit and is more effectively regulated under an individual approval.
