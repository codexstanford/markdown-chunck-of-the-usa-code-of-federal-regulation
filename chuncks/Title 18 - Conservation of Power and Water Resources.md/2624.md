####### Essential agricultural user.

(d)(1) An essential agricultural user shall calculate its attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the Annual Quantity Entitlements from such direct supplier and dividing the product (numerator) by the sum of all Annual Quantity Entitlements and all volumes received from sources not providing an Annual Quantity Entitlement to such user (denominator).

(2) If an essential agricultural user does not have annual quantity entitlements only with respect to one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to such direct supplier shall be that part of the total essential agricultural requirements not attributed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(3) If an essential agricultural user does not have Annual Quantity Entitlements with respect to more than one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier shall be calculated by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the total volume of natural gas received from such supplier in 1972 and dividing the product (numerator) by the total supplies of natural gas received from all sources in 1972 (denominator).
