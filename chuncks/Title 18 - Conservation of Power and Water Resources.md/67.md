###### ยง 2.18 Phased electric rate increase filings.

(a) In general, when a public utility files a phased rate increase, the Commission will determine the appropriate suspension period based on the total increase requested in all phases. If a utility files a rate increase within sixty days after filing another rate increase, the Commission will consider the filings together to be a phased rate increase request.

(b) This policy will not be applied if the increase is phased:

(1) To coordinate with new facilities coming on line;

(2) To implement a rate moderation plan;

(3) To avoid price squeeze;

(4) To comply with a settlement approved by the Commission; or

(5) If the utility makes a convincing showing that application of the policy would be harsh and inequitable and that, therefore, good cause has been shown not to apply the policy in the case.
