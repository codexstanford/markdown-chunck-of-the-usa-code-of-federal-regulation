###### ยง 2.21 Regional Transmission Groups.
####### General policy.

(a)The Commission encourages Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) as a means of enabling the market for electric power to operate in a more competitive and efficient way. The Commission believes that RTGs can provide a means of coordinating regional planning of the transmission system and assuring that system capabilities are always adequate to meet system demands. RTG agreements that contain components that satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section generally will be considered to be just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential under the Federal Power Act (FPA). The Commission encourages RTG agreements that contain as much detail as possible in all of the components listed, particularly if the RTG participants will be seeking Commission deference to decisions reached under an RTG agreement.
