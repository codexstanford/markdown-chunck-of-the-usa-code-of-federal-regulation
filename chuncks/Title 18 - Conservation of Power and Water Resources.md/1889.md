##### See

A. This account shall include the amounts of regulatory-created assets, not includible in other accounts, resulting from the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. (Definition No. 30.)

B. The amounts included in this account are to be established by those charges which would have been included in net income, or accumulated other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing rates that the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services. When specific identification of the particular source of a regulatory asset cannot be made, such as in plant phase-ins, rate moderation plans, or rate levelization plans, account 407.4, regulatory credits, shall be credited. The amounts recorded in this account are generally to be charged, concurrently with the recovery of the amounts in rates, to the same account that would have been charged if included in income when incurred, except all regulatory assets established through the use of account 407.4 shall be charged to account 407.3, regulatory debits, concurrent with the recovery in rates.

C. If rate recovery of all or part of an amount included in this account is disallowed, the disallowed amount shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions, or Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, in the year of the disallowance.

D. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be kept so that the utility can furnish full information as to the nature and amount of each regulatory asset included in this account, including justification for inclusion of such amounts in this account.

A. This account shall be charged with all expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc., made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation. If construction results, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged. If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be made to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense account.

B. This account shall also include costs of studies and analyses mandated by regulatory bodies related to plant in service. If construction results from such studies, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged with an equitable portion of such study costs directly attributable to new construction. The portion of such study costs not attributable to new construction or the entire cost if construction does not result shall be charged to account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Costs, or the appropriate operating expense account. The costs of such studies relative to plant under construction shall be included directly in account 107, Construction Work in Progress-Electric.

C. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish complete information as to the nature and the purpose of the survey, plans, or investigations and the nature and amounts of the several charges.

This caption shall include undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein relate to a future period.

This account shall include amounts shown by work orders for plant installed for temporary use in utility service for periods of less than one year. Such work orders shall be charged with the cost of temporary facilities and credited with payments received from customers and net salvage realized on removal of the temporary facilities. Any net credit or debit resulting shall be cleared to account 451, Miscellaneous Service Revenues.

A. For Major utilities, this account shall include all debits not elsewhere provided for, such as miscellaneous work in progress, and unusual or extraordinary expenses, not included in other accounts, which are in process of amortization and items the proper final disposition of which is uncertain.

B. For Nonmajor utilities, this account shall include the following classes of items:

(1) Expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc., made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation. If construction results, this account shall be credited with the amount applicable thereto and the appropriate plant accounts shall be charged with an amount which does not exceed the expenditures which may reasonably be determined to contribute directly and immediately and without duplication to plant. If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense accounts.

(2) Undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein related to a future period.

(3) Balances representing expenditures for work in progress other than on utility plant. This includes jobbing and contract work in progress.

(4) Other debit balances, the proper final disposition of which is uncertain and unusual or extraordinary expenses not included in other accounts, which are in process of being written off.

C. For both Major and Nonmajor utilities, the records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish full information as to each deferred debit included herein.

This account shall include losses from the sale or other disposition of property previously recorded in account 105, Electric Plant held for Future Use, under the provisions of paragraphs B, C, and D thereof, where such losses are significant and are to be amortized over a period of 5 years, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. The amortization of the amounts in this account shall be made by debits to account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant. (See account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use.)

A. This account shall be charged with the cost of all expenditures coming within the meaning of Research, Development and Demonstration (RD & D) of this uniform system of accounts (see definition 27.B.), except those expenditures properly chargeable to account 107, Construction Work in Progress-Electric.

B. Costs that are minor or of a general or recurring nature shall be transferred from this account to the appropriate operating expense function or if such costs are common to the overall operations or cannot be feasibly allocated to the various operating accounts, then such costs shall be recorded in account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.

C. In certain instances a company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures which are nonrecurring and which would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period. In such a case the portion of such amounts that cause the distortion may be amortized to the appropriate operating expense account over a period not to exceed 5 years unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

D. The entries in this account must be so maintained as to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.

This account shall include the losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed. The amounts in this account shall be amortized in accordance with General Instruction 17.

A. This account shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating Income, or account 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are higher because of the inclusion of certain items in income for tax purposes, which items for general accounting purposes will not be fully reflected in the utility's determination of annual net income until subsequent years.

B. This account shall be credited and account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by paragraph A above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. Such credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by the Commission.

C. Vintage year records with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the account balance, shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized.

D. The utility is restricted in its use of this account to the purpose set forth above. It shall not make use of the balance in this account or any portion thereof except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the Commission. Any remaining deferred tax account balance with respect to an amount for any prior year's tax deferral, the amortization of which or other recognition in the utility's income accounts has been completed, or other disposition made, shall be debited to account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise disposed of as the Commission may authorize or direct. (See General Instruction 18.)
