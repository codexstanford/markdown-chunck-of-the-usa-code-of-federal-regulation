####### Requirement to consult.

(a)(1) Before it files any application for an original license or an exemption from licensing that is described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, a potential applicant must consult with the relevant Federal, State, and interstate resource agencies, including the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal agency administering any federal lands or facilities utilized or occupied by the project, the appropriate State fish and wildlife agencies, the appropriate State water resource management agencies, the certifying agency under section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act), 33 U.S.C. § 1341(c)(1), and any Indian tribe that may be affected by the proposed project.

(2) Each requirement in this section to contact or consult with resource agencies or Indian tribes shall be construed to require as well that the potential applicant contact or consult with members of the public.

(3) If a potential applicant for an original license commences first stage pre-filing consultation on or after July 23, 2005 it shall file a notification of intent to file a license application pursuant to § 5.5 and a pre-application document pursuant to the provisions of § 5.6.

(4) The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will, upon request, provide a list of known appropriate Federal, state, and interstate resource agencies, Indian tribes, and local, regional, or national non-governmental organizations likely to be interested in any license application proceeding.

(5) An applicant for an exemption from licensing or an applicant for a license seeking benefits under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, as amended, for a project that would be located at a new dam or diversion must, in addition to meeting the requirements of this section, comply with the consultation requirements in § 4.301.

(6) The pre-filing consultation requirements of this section apply only to an application for:

(i) Original license;

(ii) Exemption;

(iii) Amendment to an application for original license or exemption that materially amends the proposed plans of development as defined in § 4.35(f)(1);

(iv) Amendment to an existing license that would increase the capacity of the project as defined in § 4.201(b); or

(v) Amendment to an existing license that would not increase the capacity of the project as defined in § 4.201(b), but that would involve:

(A) The construction of a new dam or diversion in a location where there is no existing dam or diversion;

(B) Any repair, modification, or reconstruction of an existing dam that would result in a significant change in the normal maximum surface area or elevation of an existing impoundment; or

(C) The addition of new water power turbines other than to replace existing turbines.

(7) Before it files a non-capacity related amendment as defined in § 4.201(c), an applicant must consult with the resource agencies and Indian tribes listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the extent that the proposed amendment would affect the interests of the agencies or tribes. When consultation is necessary, the applicant must, at a minimum, provide the resource agencies and Indian tribes with copies of the draft application and allow them at least 60 days to comment on the proposed amendment. The amendment as filed with the Commission must summarize the consultation with the resource agencies and Indian tribes on the proposed amendment, propose reasonable protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures to respond to impacts identified as being caused by the proposed amendment, and respond to any objections, recommendations, or conditions submitted by the agencies or Indian tribes. Copies of all written correspondence between the applicant, the agencies, and the tribes must be attached to the application.

(8) This section does not apply to any application for a new license, a nonpower license, a subsequent license, or surrender of a license subject to sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power Act.

(9) If a potential applicant has any doubt as to whether a particular application or amendment would be subject to the pre-filing consultation requirements of this section or if a waiver of the pre-filing requirements would be appropriate, the applicant may file a written request for clarification or waiver with the Director, Office of Energy Projects.
