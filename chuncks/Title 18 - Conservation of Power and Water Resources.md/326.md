If the substantiated plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the application for exemption from licensing.

(2) If an application for a license and an application for exemption from licensing, or two or more applications for exemption from licensing are each accepted for filing and each proposes to develop a mutually exclusive project, the Commission will favor the applicant whose plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region. If the plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the applicant with the earliest application acceptance date.
