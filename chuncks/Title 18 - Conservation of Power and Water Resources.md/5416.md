##### ยง 1304.8 Denials.

TVA may, at its sole discretion, deny any application to construct, operate, conduct, or maintain any obstruction, structure, facility, or activity that in TVA's judgment would be contrary to the unified development and regulation of the Tennessee River system, would adversely affect navigation, flood control, public lands or reservations, the environment, or sensitive resources (including, without limitation, federally listed threatened or endangered species, high priority State-listed species, wetlands with high function and value, archaeological or historical sites of national significance, and other sites or locations identified in TVA Reservoir Land Management Plans as requiring protection of the environment), or would be inconsistent with TVA's Shoreline Management Policy. In lieu of denial, TVA may require mitigation measures where, in TVA's sole judgment, such measures would adequately protect against adverse effects.
