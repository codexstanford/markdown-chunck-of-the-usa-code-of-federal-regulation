(2)(i) If discovery under this subpart would require the production of Commission information, documents, or other matter that might fall within a privilege, the Commission trial staff must identify in writing the applicable privilege along with the matters claimed to be privileged or the individuals from whom privileged information is sought, to the presiding officer and the parties.

(ii) If the presiding officer determines that the privilege claimed for the Commission is applicable, the Commission information, documents, or other matter may not be produced. If the presiding officer determines that no privilege is applicable, that a privilege is waived, or that a qualified privilege is overcome, the presiding officer will certify the matter to the Commission in accordance with Rule 714. Certification to the Commission under this paragraph must describe the material to be disclosed and the reasons which, in the presiding officer's view, justify disclosure. The information will not be disclosed unless the Commission affirmatively orders the material disclosed.
