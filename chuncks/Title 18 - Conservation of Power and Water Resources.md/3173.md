###### Intermediate point commodity rate regulations,Intermediate origin points.

(b)-(1)The rate for service provided to a published destination point from an origin point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate from the next more distant origin point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:

(i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more "next more distant" points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.

(ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published origin points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.

(iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published origin points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.

(iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate from the proposed intermediate origin point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply this rule from such intermediate point.
