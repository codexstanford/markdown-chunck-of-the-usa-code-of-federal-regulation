####### Exhibit B

(c)is a statement of project operation and resource utilization. If the project includes more than one dam with associated facilities, the information must be provided separately for each such discrete development. The exhibit must contain:

(1) A statement whether operation of the powerplant will be manual or automatic, an estimate of the annual plant factor, and a statement of how the project will be operated during adverse, mean, and high water years;

(2) An estimate of the dependable capacity and average annual energy production in kilowatt-hours (or a mechanical equivalent), supported by the following data:

(i) The minimum, mean, and maximum recorded flows in cubic feet per second of the stream or other body of water at the powerplant intake or point of diversion, with a specification of any adjustments made for evaporation, leakage, minimum flow releases (including duration of releases), or other reductions in available flow; monthly flow duration curves indicating the period of record and the gauging stations used in deriving the curves; and a specification of the period of critical streamflow used to determine the dependable capacity;

(ii) An area-capacity curve showing the gross storage capacity and usable storage capacity of the impoundment, with a rule curve showing the proposed operation of the impoundment and how the usable storage capacity is to be utilized;

(iii) The estimated hydraulic capacity of the powerplant (minimum and maximum flow through the powerplant) in cubic feet per second;

(iv) A tailwater rating curve; and

(v) A curve showing powerplant capability versus head and specifying maximum, normal, and minimum heads;

(3) A statement, with load curves and tabular data, if necessary, of the manner in which the power generated at the project is to be utilized, including the amount of power to be used on-site, if any, the amount of power to be sold, and the identity of any proposed purchasers; and

(4) A statement of the applicant's plans, if any, for future development of the project or of any other existing or proposed water power project on the stream or other body of water, indicating the approximate location and estimated installed capacity of the proposed developments.
