####### Implementing procedures.

(c)(1) Pipelines acting pursuant to this section may submit on or before December 31, 1990, a non-PGA rate filing under section 4(e) of the Natural Gas Act. Pipelines may include in their filings a fixed charge and a volumetric surcharge to recover buyout and buydown costs actually paid as of the date of filing plus similar costs which are known and measurable within the following nine months. Detailed support for the amounts claimed and for the calculation of customer surcharges must be provided. In addition, the pipeline must disclose and describe all consideration, both cash and noncash, given to producers in exchange for take-or-pay relief.

(2) In any filings made under this section, pipelines must include proposals for periodic (preferably annual) adjustments to customer surcharges, together with any necessary accounting procedures, designed to assure that revenues recovered by the pipeline remain in balance with buyout and buydown costs covered by the filing and actually incurred by the pipeline.
