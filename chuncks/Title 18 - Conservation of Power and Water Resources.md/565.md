(C) A monthly flow duration curve indicating the period of record and the location of gauging station(s), including identification number(s), used in deriving the curve; and a specification of the critical streamflow used to determine the project's dependable capacity;

(D) Existing and proposed uses of project waters for irrigation, domestic water supply, industrial and other purposes, including any upstream or downstream requirements or constraints to accommodate those purposes;

(E) Existing instream flow uses of streams in the project area that would be affected by project construction and operation; information on existing water rights and water rights applications potentially affecting or affected by the project;
