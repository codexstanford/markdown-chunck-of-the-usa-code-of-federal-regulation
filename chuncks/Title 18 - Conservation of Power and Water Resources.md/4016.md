(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the formula for determining each fee is the work months dedicated to the given fee category for the six fiscal years 1987 through 1992 or all years prior to FY 93 for which data are available divided by the number of actual completions in the six fiscal years 1987 through 1992 or all years prior to FY 93 for which data are available multiplied by the average monthly employee cost in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available.

(2) With respect to the fees charged to pipelines filing pursuant to ยง 381.207(a), the fee for the first year will be $1,000.

With the addition of future years, the formula for ยง 381.207(a) fees will be updated to include that year as part of the base period.
