####### Second stage of consultation.

(c)(1) Unless determined otherwise by the Director of the Office of Energy Projects pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a potential applicant must complete all reasonable and necessary studies and obtain all reasonable and necessary information requested by resource agencies and Indian tribes under paragraph (b):

(i) Prior to filing the application, if the results:

(A) Would influence the financial (e.g., instream flow study) or technical feasibility of the project (e.g., study of potential mass soil movement); or

(B) Are needed to determine the design or location of project features, reasonable alternatives to the project, the impact of the project on important natural or cultural resources (e.g., resource surveys), suitable mitigation or enhancement measures, or to minimize impact on significant resources (e.g., wild and scenic river, anadromous fish, endangered species, caribou migration routes);

(ii) After filing the application but before license issuance, if the applicant complied with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as applicable, no later than four years prior to the expiration date of the existing license and the results:

(A) Would be those described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) or (B) of this section; and

(B) Would take longer to conduct and evaluate than the time between the conclusion of the first stage of consultation and the new license application filing deadline.

(iii) After a new license is issued, if the studies can be conducted or the information obtained only after construction or operation of proposed facilities, would determine the success of protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures (e.g., post-construction monitoring studies), or would be used to refine project operation or modify project facilities.

(2) If, after the end of the first stage of consultation as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, a resource agency, Indian tribe, or member of the public requests that the potential applicant conduct a study or gather information not previously identified and specifies the basis for its request, under paragraphs (b)(5)(i)-(vi) of this section, the potential applicant will promptly initiate the study or gather the information, unless the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines under paragraph (b)(5) of this section either that the study or information is unreasonable or unnecessary or that use of the methodology requested by a resource agency or Indian tribe for conducting the study is not a generally accepted practice.

(3) (i) The results of studies and information gathering referenced in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section will be treated as additional information; and

(ii) Filing and acceptance of an application will not be delayed and an application will not be considered deficient or patently deficient pursuant to ยง 4.32 (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this chapter merely because the study or information gathering is not complete before the application is filed.

(4) A potential applicant must provide each resource agency and Indian tribe with:

(i) A copy of its draft application that:

(A) Indicates the type of application the potential applicant expects to file with the Commission; and

(B) Responds to any comments and recommendations made by any resource agency or Indian tribe either during the first stage of consultation or under paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

(ii) The results of all studies and information gathering either requested by that resource agency or Indian tribe in the first stage of consultation (or under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if available) or which pertains to resources of interest to that resource agency or Indian tribe and which were identified by the potential applicant pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, including a discussion of the results and any proposed protection, mitigation, or enhancement measure; and

(iii) A written request for review and comment.

(5) A resource agency or Indian tribe will have 90 days from the date of the potential applicant's letter transmitting the paragraph (c)(4) of this section information to it to provide written comments on the information submitted by a potential applicant under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

(6) If the written comments provided under paragraph (c)(5) of this section indicate that a resource agency or Indian tribe has a substantive disagreement with a potential applicant's conclusions regarding resource impacts or its proposed protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures, the potential applicant will:

(i) Hold at least one joint meeting with the disagreeing resource agency or Indian tribe and other agencies with similar or related areas of interest, expertise, or responsibility not later than 60 days from the date of the disagreeing agency's or Indian tribe's written comments to discuss and to attempt to reach agreement on its plan for environmental protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures; and

(ii) Consult with the disagreeing agency or Indian tribe and other agencies with similar or related areas of interest, expertise, or responsibility on the scheduling of the joint meeting and provide the disagreeing resource agency or Indian tribe, other agencies with similar or related areas of interest, expertise, or responsibility, and the Commission with written notice of the time and place of each meeting and a written agenda of the issues to be discussed at the meeting at least 15 days in advance.

(7) The potential applicant and any disagreeing resource agency or Indian tribe may conclude a joint meeting with a document embodying any agreement among them regarding environmental protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures and any issues that are unresolved.

(8) The potential applicant must describe all disagreements with a resource agency or Indian tribe on technical or environmental protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures in its application, including an explanation of the basis for the applicant's disagreement with the resource agency or Indian tribe, and must include in its application any document developed pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

(9) A potential applicant may file an application with the Commission if:

(i) It has complied with paragraph (c)(4) of this section and no resource agency or Indian tribe has responded with substantive disagreements by the deadline specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section; or

(ii) It has complied with paragraph (c)(6) of this section if any resource agency or Indian tribe has responded with substantive disagreements.

(10) The second stage of consultation ends:

(i) Ninety days after the submittal of information pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section in cases where no resource agency or Indian tribe has responded with substantive disagreements; or
