The top of the first page of each such document will contain the word "PUBLIC" or "NONPUBLIC," to indicate whether it contains such exempt information.

(2) One copy of each version shall be served on counsel for the petitioner and/or the Secretary, and one copy of the PUBLIC version shall be served on counsel for each other participant separately represented unless the conditions of Rule 903 are met, in which situation such counsel shall be served with copies of both versions.

They will have regard for the fact that the Secretary's entire administrative record is always available to the Commission and will not include irrelevant or duplicative documents in the appendices.
