2-2(a) This group of accounts shall include the cost of long-term investments in securities other than those of the accounting carrier, investment advances, sinking and other funds, cash value of life insurance policies, and other items of similar nature.

(b) Investment in securities shall be recorded at cost at time of acquisition excluding amounts paid for accrued interest and dividends. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount or premium, such discount or premium shall be amortized over the remaining life of the securities by periodical debits or credits to the account in which the cost of the securities is recorded with corresponding credits or debits to interest income. If the amount of the discount or premium is minor, the investment may be maintained at actual cost without adjustment, and the amount of discount or premium recorded in the interest income account at the time the securities mature.
