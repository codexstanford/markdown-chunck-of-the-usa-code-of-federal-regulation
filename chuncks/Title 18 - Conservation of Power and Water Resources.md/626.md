###### National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

(v)Section 106 of NHPA requires the Commission to take into account the effect of licensing a hydropower project on any historic properties, and allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Advisory Council) a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed action. "Historic Properties" are defined as any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). If there would be an adverse effect on historic properties, the applicant may include a Historic Properties Management Plan (HPMP) to avoid or mitigate the effects. The applicant must include documentation of consultation with the Advisory Council, the State Historic Preservation Officer, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, National Park Service, members of the public, and affected Indian tribes, where applicable.
