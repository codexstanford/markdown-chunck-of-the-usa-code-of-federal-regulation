####### Combined Cycle Price

(ii) Ais a price determined pursuant to a formula established by a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility using published natural gas price indices, a proxy heat rate, and variable operations and maintenance costs for an efficient natural gas combined-cycle generating facility. Before establishing such a formula rate, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility must determine that the resulting Combined Cycle Price represents an appropriate measure of the purchasing electric utility's avoided cost for energy, based on its evaluation of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

(A) Whether the cost of energy from an efficient natural gas combined cycle generating facility represents a reasonable measure of a competitive price in the purchasing electric utility's region;

(B) Whether natural gas priced pursuant to particular proposed natural gas price indices would be available in the relevant market;

(C) Whether there should be an adjustment to the natural gas price to appropriately reflect the cost of transporting natural gas to the relevant market; and

(D) Whether the proxy heat rate used in the formula should be updated regularly to reflect improvements in generation technology.
