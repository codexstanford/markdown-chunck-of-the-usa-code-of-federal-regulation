2-7

(a) A contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to a carrier that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Resolution of the uncertainty may confirm the acquisition of an asset or the reduction of a liability or the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability.

(b) An estimated loss from a contingent liability shall be charged to income if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The carrier shall disclose in a footnote in its annual report any accrued contingent liabilities, along with any contingent liabilities not meeting both conditions for accrual if there is a reasonable possibility that a liability may have been incurred.

(c) Contingent assets should not be reflected in the accounts. The carrier shall disclose in a footnote in its annual report any contingencies that might result in an asset.
