####### "Special Handling" notation.

(2)Classified information will not be released or disclosed to any foreign national without proper specific authorization. This applies even when the classified material does not bear the special handling notice described below. The special handling notice indicated only that the material has been reviewed and a specific determination made that the information is not releasable to foreign nationals. If it is anticipated that the handling or distribution of a classified document will make it liable to inadvertent disclosure to foreign nationals it will be marked with a separate special handling notation, which will be carried forward to letters of transmittals or other cover documents. The notation reads:

(g) Whenever classified material is upgraded, downgraded, or declassified, the material will be marked to reflect:

(1) The change in classification.

(2) The authority for the action.

(3) The effective date.

(4) The person or unit taking the action.

(h) In addition to the foregoing marking requirements, warning notices shall be displayed prominently on classified documents or materials as prescribed below. When display of these warning notices on the documents or other materials is not feasible, the warnings shall be included in the written notification of the assigned classification.
