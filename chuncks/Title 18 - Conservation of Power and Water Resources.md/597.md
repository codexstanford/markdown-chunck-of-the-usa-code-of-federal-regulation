(c)If a potential applicant has stated that it intends to seek PURPA benefits, comments on the pre-application document by a fish and wildlife agency must provide the potential applicant with a reasonable estimate of the total costs the agency anticipates it will incur in order to set mandatory terms and conditions for the proposed project. An agency may provide a potential applicant with an updated estimate as it deems necessary. If any agency believes that its most recent estimate will be exceeded by more than 25 percent, it must supply the potential applicant with a new estimate and submit a copy to the Commission.
