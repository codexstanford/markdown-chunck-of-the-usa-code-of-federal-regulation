### Subchapter F - Accounts, Natural Gas Act
#### PART 201 - UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS PRESCRIBED FOR NATURAL GAS COMPANIES SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE NATURAL GAS ACT
##### Major,Nonmajor

B. This system applies to both Major and Nonmajor natural gas companies. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Class C and Class D (part 104 of this chapter) now revoked. The notations "(Nonmajor)" and "(Major)" have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from the previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the(previous Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden for the(previous Class C and Class D).

C. The class to which any natural gas company belongs shall originally be determined by its annual gas volume in each of the last three consecutive years, or, in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made when the volume for each of the three immediately preceding years exceeds the upper limit, or is less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the natural gas company.

D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.
