####### Energy generated at the headwater project.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is to be attributed to the joint-use power cost is derived by multiplying the total annual generation at the headwater project and the ratio of the project investment cost assigned to the joint-use power cost to the sum of the investment cost assigned to both the specific power cost and the joint-use power cost of the headwater project, as follows:

(2) If the headwater project contains a pumped storage facility, calculation of the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is attributable to the joint-use power cost will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

(3) If no power is generated at the headwater project, the amount of energy attributable to the joint-use power cost under this section is the total of all downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.
