Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 77 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.
