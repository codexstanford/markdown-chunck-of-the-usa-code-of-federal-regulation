####### Timing.

(e)(1) Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. A public utility may require a purchasing utility to declare, no later than the beginning of the coordination transaction:

(i) Whether it will purchase or return emissions allowances; and

(ii) If it will return emissions allowances, the date on which those allowances will be returned.

(2) Public utilities may include in agreements with purchasing utilities non-discriminatory provisions for indemnification if the purchasing utility fails to provide emissions allowances by the date on which it declares that the allowances will be returned.
