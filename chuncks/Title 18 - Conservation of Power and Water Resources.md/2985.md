## Chapter I - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Department of Energy
### Subchapter K - Regulations Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
#### PART 292 - REGULATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 201 AND 210 OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY POLICIES ACT OF 1978 WITH REGARD TO SMALL POWER PRODUCTION AND COGENERATION
##### Subpart C - Arrangements Between Electric Utilities and Qualifying Cogeneration and Small Power Production Facilities Under Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
###### ยง 292.309 Termination of obligation to purchase from qualifying facilities.
####### inter alia,

(1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating,that:

(i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

(ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

(2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:

(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;

(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;

(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section ยง 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);

(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;

(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

(f) The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) qualifies as a market described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than five megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to that market through Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved open access protocols, and that electric utilities that operate within ERCOT should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.
