###### Exemptions.

(c)(1) If an agency of the State in which the utility is organized and operating approves or authorizes, in writing, the issuance of securities prior to their issuance, the utility is exempt from the provisions of sections 19, 20 and 204 of the Federal Power Act and the regulations under this part, with respect to such securities.

(2) This part does not apply to the issue or renewal of, or assumption of liability on, a note or draft maturing one year or less after the date of such issue, renewal, or assumption of liability, if the aggregate of such note or draft and all other then-outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of one year or less on which the utility is primarily or secondarily liable, is not more than 5 percent of the par value of the other then-outstanding securities of the utility as of the date of issue or renewal of, or assumption of liability on, the note or draft. In the case of securities having no par value, the par value for the purpose of this part is the fair market value, as of the date of issue or renewal of, or assumption of liability on, the note or draft.
