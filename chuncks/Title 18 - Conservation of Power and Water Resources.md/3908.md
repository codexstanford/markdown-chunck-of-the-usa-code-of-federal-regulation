####### Activation of COOP and suspension of Commission operations.

(a)(1)(i)The Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan may be activated by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to ยง 376.205, as appropriate). In circumstances in which the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission headquarters operations may be temporarily disrupted in whole or in part or communications with Commission headquarters may be temporarily unavailable, either of which may prevent the public or the Commission from meeting regulatory or statutory requirements. After the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission operations other than emergency functions may be suspended in whole or in part by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate). The provisions of this section are effective upon activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and the subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, and shall remain in effect up to 30 days, or such shorter time than 30 days as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate, or such longer time than 30 days as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to section 376.204 of this Part, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate. Resumption of Commission operations following activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and any subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, may occur either simultaneously for all activities, or over time for just some activities, and in such manner and at such time, as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) or the Commission (or the Commission's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate.
