13.A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service such as gas, electric, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as "common utility plant."

B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to gas department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as gas plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and gas plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraph C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.

C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) the basis of the allocation.

D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.

E.
