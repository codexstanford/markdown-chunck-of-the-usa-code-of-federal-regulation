(e)(1) When circumstances indicate that newly acquired property should be subject to amortization, or that the prescribed depreciation rates based on the service lives of certain property are no longer applicable, because the source of traffic will be exhausted before the end of the physical service life, the carrier shall submit to the Commission for approval amortization or depreciation rates based on the estimated remaining service life of the property accompanied by full information justifying the request.

(2) A carrier may request, or the Commission may direct, that special accounting be applied in situations causing undue inflation or deflation of depreciation reserves, such as premature or unusual retirements or sales of depreciable property, or related insurance recoveries. A carrier's request for special accounting shall contain full particulars concerning the situation, including the basis for its proposal. Alternative accounting techniques shall be applied to the extent approved or directed by the Commission.
