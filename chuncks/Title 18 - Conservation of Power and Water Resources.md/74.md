###### ยง 2.20 Good faith requests for transmission services and good faith responses by transmitting utilities.
####### e.g.

(iv) If a transmitting utility determines that it can provide part but not all of the requested services without building new facilities, it should inform the applicant of any portion of the requested services that can be performed without constructing additional facilities or modifying existing facilities. In effect, the transmitting utility may be able to treat such a request as two separate transactions-one for service on existing facilities and the other as a request involving expansion decisions. Furthermore, where there are alternative, less expensive means of satisfying all or a portion of a transmission request, the Commission expects the transmitting utility to explore such alternatives (, redispatching certain generating units to alleviate a constraint).
