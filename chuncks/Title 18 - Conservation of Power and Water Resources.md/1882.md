3.

A. The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts shall include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in utility operations, except (1) minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in plant accounts 391 to 398, inclusive, which shall be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account and (2) rents which are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed therefrom to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents shall be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis.

B. When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with utility operations is subleased, the revenue derived from such subleasing shall be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues; provided, however, that in case the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property shall be credited to such clearing account.

C. The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, shall be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned.

D. The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to electric plant leased from others shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 6.
