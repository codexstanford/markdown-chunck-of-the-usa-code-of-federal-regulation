##### Accounting method.

1-4(a) This system of accounts shall be kept by the accrual method of accounting. The basis used for accruing income and expense items each month shall be consistently applied and any change in such basis or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be promptly reported to the Commission.

(b) When the amount of any transaction cannot be accurately determined in time for inclusion in the applicable month's accounts, an estimated amount shall be entered in the proper accounts. Appropriate adjustments shall be made as soon as the actual amounts become known or at the time a substantial change is indicated. Carriers are not required to anticipate minor items which do not appreciably affect the accounts.
