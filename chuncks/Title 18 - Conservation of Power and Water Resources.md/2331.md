(xii) Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801,)

(3) The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with:

(i) Paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section only if it adheres to the procedures in appendix I of this subpart in which case the Commission finds that endangered species and their critical habitat are protected in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 1536;

(ii) Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section only if it adheres to the procedures in appendix II of this subpart in which case the Commission finds that there is no effect on any property protected by 16 U.S.C. 470f;

(iii) Paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section only if the appropriate state agency designated to administer the state's coastal zone management plan, prior to construction of the project, waives its right of review or determines that the project complies with the state's coastal zone management plan.

(iv) Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (viii) of this section only if it adheres to Commission staff's current "Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation and Maintenance Plan" and "Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures" which are available on the Commission Internet home page or from the Commission staff, or gets written approval from the staff or the appropriate Federal or state agency for the use of project-specific alternatives to clearly identified portions of those documents.

(4) Any transaction authorized under a blanket certificate shall not have a significant adverse impact on a sensitive environmental area.

(5)(i) The noise attributable to any new compressor station, compression added to an existing station, or any modification, upgrade or update of an existing station, must not exceed a day-night level (L) of 55 dBA at any pre-existing noise-sensitive area (such as schools, hospitals, or residences).

(ii) A compressor facility installed under this section must be designed to meet the following noise emissions criteria. For each new compressor station facility, and for each addition or modification to an existing compression station, the blanket certificate holder must file a noise survey with the Secretary within 60 days of placing the facility in service.

(A) If noise emitted from a new compressor facility operating at full load exceeds an Lof 55 dBA at any noise-sensitive area (NSA), or if an addition or modification to an existing compressor station operating at full load at or below an Lof 55 dBA at NSAs causes overall noise attributable to the station to exceed an Lof 55 dBA at an NSA, the blanket certificate holder must come into compliance with an Lof 55 dBA at NSAs within 1 year of placing the facility in service.

(B) If an addition or modification to an existing compressor station operating at full load above an Lof 55 dBA at NSAs causes overall noise attributable to the station to increase at an NSA, the blanket certificate holder must act within 1 year of placing the added or modified facility in service to reduce noise at NSAs to the level that existed prior to the addition or modification.

(C) If the initial noise survey demonstrates a need to take action to mitigate noise, within 60 days of completing such action, the blanket certificate holder must file a subsequent noise survey with the Secretary demonstrating that each new compressor station facility, and each addition or modification to an existing compressor station, complies with the noise level limits.

(iii) Any horizontal directional drilling or drilling of wells which will occur between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. local time must be conducted with the goal of keeping the perceived noise from the drilling at any pre-existing noise-sensitive area (such as schools, hospitals, or residences) at or below a night level (L) of 55 dBA.

(6)(i) Any activity otherwise subject to authorization under ยง 157.208 shall not be authorized if the activity is located within 0.5 mile of a nuclear power plant which is either operating or under construction, or for which a construction permit has been filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

(ii) Any activity otherwise subject to authorization under ยง 157.215 shall not be authorized if the activity is located within 2.0 miles of a nuclear power plant which is either operating or under construction, or for which a construction permit has been filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

(7) The certificate holder shall act as the Commission's non-Federal representative upon acceptance of the blanket certificate for purposes of complying with the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
