(h)(1) For each calendar quarter, the Responsible Party must post the set of measures detailed in paragraph (h)(1)(i) through paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section related to the Responsible Party's processing of transmission service request system impact studies and facilities studies. The Responsible Party must calculate and post the measures in paragraph (h)(1)(i) through paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section for requests for short-term firm point-to-point transmission service, requests for long-term firm point-to-point transmission service, and requests to designate a new network resource or network load. When calculating the measures in paragraph (h)(1)(i) through paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, the Responsible Party may aggregate requests for short-term firm point-to-point service and requests for long-term firm point-to-point service, but must calculate and post measures separately for transmission service requests from Affiliates and transmission service requests from Transmission Customers who are not Affiliates. The Responsible Party is required to include in the calculations of the measures in paragraph (h)(1)(i) through paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section all studies the Responsible Party conducts of transmission service requests on another Transmission Provider's OASIS.
