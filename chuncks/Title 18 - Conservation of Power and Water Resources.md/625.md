###### Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).

(iv)Section 307(c)(3) of the CZMA requires that all Federally licensed and permitted activities be consistent with approved state Coastal Zone Management Programs. If the project is located within a coastal zone boundary or if a project affects a resource located in the boundaries of the designated coastal zone, the applicant must certify that the project is consistent with the state Coastal Zone Management Program. If the project is within or affects a resource within the coastal zone, provide the date the applicant sent the consistency certification information to the state agency, the date the state agency received the certification, and the date and action taken by the state agency (for example, the agency will either agree or disagree with the consistency statement, waive it, or ask for additional information). Describe any conditions placed on the state agency's concurrence and assess the conditions in the appropriate section of the license application. If the project is not in or would not affect the coastal zone, state so and cite the coastal zone program office's concurrence.
