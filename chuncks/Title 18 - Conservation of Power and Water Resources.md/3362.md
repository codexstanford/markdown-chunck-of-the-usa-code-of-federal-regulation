##### Acquisition by merger, consolidation or purchase.

3-11Accounting for property acquired by business combination of two or more corporations, or the acquisition of properties comprising a distinct operating system, or integral portion thereof as specified in section 3-1, shall depend on whether there has been (1) a merger or consolidation in a "pooling of interests" or (2) a "purchase." A "pooling of interests" may exist when holders of all or substantially all of the ownership interests, usually common stock, in the constituent corporations or entities become the owners of a surviving corporation or a new corporation which owns the assets and business of the constituent corporations or entities directly or through one or more subsidiaries. However, when the stockholders of one of the constituent corporations obtain 90 percent or more of the voting interest in the combined enterprise; or when there is a plan or firm intention and understanding to retire a substantial part of the capital stock issued to the owners of one or more of the constituent corporations or substantial changes in ownership which occurred shortly before or planned to occur shortly after the combination, the combination may be considered a "purchase."
