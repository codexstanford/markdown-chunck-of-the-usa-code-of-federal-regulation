####### Limitations on protest.

(2)Protests may be filed to any initial self-certification or application for Commission certification filed on or after the effective date of this final rule, and to any self-recertification or application for Commission recertification that are filed on or after December 31, 2020 that makes substantive changes to the existing certification. Once the Commission has certified an applicant's qualifying facility status either in response to a protest opposing a self-certification or self-recertification, or in response to an application for Commission certification or Commission recertification, any later protest to a self-recertification or application for Commission recertification making substantive changes to a qualifying facility's certification must demonstrate changed circumstances that call into question the continued validity of the certification.
