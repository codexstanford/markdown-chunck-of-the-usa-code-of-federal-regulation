###### Protests.

(a)Any protest pursuant to section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act must be filed not later than 15 days after the filing of a tariff publication. If the carrier submits a separate letter with the filing, providing a telefax number and contact person, and requesting all protests to be telefaxed to the carrier by a protestant, any protest must be so telefaxed to the pipeline at the time the protest is filed with the Commission. Only persons with a substantial economic interest in the tariff filing may file a protest to a tariff filing pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act. Along with the protest, the protestant must file a verified statement which must contain a reasonably detailed description of the nature and substance of the protestant's substantial economic interest in the tariff filing.
