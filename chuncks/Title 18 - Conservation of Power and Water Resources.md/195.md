###### ยง 3b.220 Notification of maintenance of records to individuals concerned.

(a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, an individual will be notified whether a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record or records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name, or some other identifying particular.

(b) The system manager may require appropriate identification pursuant to ยง 3b.222, and if necessary, may request from the individual additional information needed to locate the record which the individual should reasonably be expected to know, such as, but not limited to, date of birth, place of birth, and a parent's first name.

(c) When practicable, the system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the inquiry within ten days of receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) and notification of whether or not a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. If the system manager is unable to provide an answer within the ten-day period, he will so inform the individual in writing, stating the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and when it is anticipated that notification will be made. Such an extension will not exceed fifteen days from receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).
