(a) Procedure on decisions by hearing examiner. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible agency official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the responsible agency official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible agency official may, on his own motion, within 45 days after the initial decison, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of notice of review, the responsible agency official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice or review the initial decision shall, subject to paragraph (e) constitute the final decision of the responsible agency official.
