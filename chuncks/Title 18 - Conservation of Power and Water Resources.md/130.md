####### General Policy.

(a)The Commission as a matter of policy will provide two distinct mechanisms for passthrough of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs of interstate natural gas pipelines. The first is pursuant to existing Commission policy and practice. Under this method, pipelines may pass through prudently incurred take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs in their sales commodity rates. The second method is available to pipelines which agree to an equitable sharing of take-or-pay costs and which transport under part 284 of this chapter. Qualifying pipelines may utilize the alternative passthrough mechanisms described in this section. Where a pipeline agrees to absorb from 25 to 50 percent of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs, the Commission will permit the pipeline to recover through a fixed charge an amount equal to (but not greater than) the amount absorbed. Any remaining costs up to 50 percent of total buyout and buydown costs may be recovered either through a commodity rate surcharge or a volumetric surcharge on total throughput.
