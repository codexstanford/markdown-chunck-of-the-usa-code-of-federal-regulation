(c) If an application to extend the term of a permit is submitted not less than 30 days prior to the termination of the permit, the permit term will be automatically extended (not to exceed a total term for the permit of eight years) until the Commission acts on the application for an extension. The Commission will not accept extension requests that are filed less than 30 days prior to the termination of the permit.

(d) At the end of the extension period granted under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may issue an additional permit to the permittee if the Commission determines that there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant the issuance of the additional permit.
