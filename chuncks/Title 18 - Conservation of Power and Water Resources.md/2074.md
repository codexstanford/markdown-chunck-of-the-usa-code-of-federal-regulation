(iv)At-Risk Revenue. For each instance where there is a separate cost-of-service associated with facilities for which the applicant is "at risk," show the base period and adjustment period revenue by customer or customer code, by rate schedule, by receipt and delivery zone, if applicable, and as 12-month totals. Provide this information by month unless otherwise agreed to by interested parties and if monthly reporting is consistent with past practice of the pipeline. However, if seasonal services are involved, or if billing determinants vary from month to month, the information must be provided monthly. Provide projected throughput (i.e., usage or commodity quantities, unadjusted for discounting) and projected contract demand levels (unadjusted for discounting).
