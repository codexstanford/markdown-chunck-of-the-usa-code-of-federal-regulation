###### ยง 35.24 Tax normalization for public utilities.
####### Special rules.

(c)(1) This paragraph applies:

(i) If the public utility has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization been applied for the tax effects of timing difference transactions originating at any time prior to the test period; or

(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in or in excess of amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities as determined by application of the current tax rate to all timing difference transactions originating in the test period and prior to the test period.

(2) The public utility must compute the income tax component in its cost of service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes described in subparagraphs (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph.

(3) The public utility must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the public utility for determining the cost of service provision described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the public utility, then the public utility must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of this method will be subject to case-by-case determination.
