###### ASC determination for Consumer-owned Utilities that elect to execute Regional Dialogue High Water Mark contracts.

(g)For Consumer-owned Utilities that elect to execute Regional Dialogue CHWM contracts, Bonneville will use the following approach:

(1) Use the RHWM System Resources as determined in the Tiered Rates Methodology (TRM) process.

(2) Determine the RHWM Exchange Load.

(3) Calculate the Utility's Contract System Cost as described in the ASC Methodology.

(4) Determine the fully allocated cost of resources used to meet Contract System Load that is not met by:

(i) The lesser of the Utility's RHWM or Forecast New Requirement, plus

(ii) Existing Resources for CHWM (as defined in the Tiered Rates Methodology).

(5) RHWM Contract System Cost = Contract System Cost minus fully allocated cost of resources (from paragraph (g)(4) of this section).

(6) RHWM Average System Cost = RHWM Contract System Cost (from paragraph (g)(5) of this section)/RHWM System Resource (from paragraph (g)(1) of this section).
