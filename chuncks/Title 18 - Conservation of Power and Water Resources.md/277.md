(i) Utilizes for electric power generation the hydroelectric potential of a conduit;

(ii) Has an installed generating capacity that does not exceed 40 MW;

(iii) Is not an integral part of a dam;

(iv) Discharges the water it uses for power generation either:

(A) Into a conduit;

(B) Directly to a point of agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption; or

(C) Into a natural water body if a quantity of water equal to or greater than the quantity discharged from the hydroelectric facility is withdrawn from that water body downstream into a conduit that is part of the same water supply system as the conduit on which the hydroelectric facility is located; and

(v) Does not rely upon construction of a dam, which construction will create any portion of the hydrostatic head that the facility uses for power generation unless that construction would occur for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumptive purposes even if hydroelectric generating facilities were not installed.
