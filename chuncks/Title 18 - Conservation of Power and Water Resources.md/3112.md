###### Changes to service territory.

(f)In the event a Utility forecasts that it will acquire a new service territory, or lose a portion of its existing service territory, and the gain or loss of that territory results in a 2.5 percent or greater change to the Utility's Base Period ASC, the Utility must file two Appendix 1 filings with Bonneville as follows:

(1) First, a Base Period ASC that does not reflect the acquisition or loss of service territory; and

(2) Second, a Base Period ASC that incorporates the following changes:

(i) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Load associated with the acquisition or reduction in service territory.

(ii) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Cost associated with the acquisition or reduction of the service territory.

(iii) A forecast of capital and operating cost increases or reductions associated with the change in service territory.

(iv) A forecast of the changes in purchased power expenses, sales for resale revenues, and other debits or credits based on the changes in the service territory.

(3) Because the date of the actual change to the Utility's service territory could differ from the forecast date used to determine the ASC during the Review Period, Bonneville will not adjust the Utility's ASC until the change in service territory takes place.
