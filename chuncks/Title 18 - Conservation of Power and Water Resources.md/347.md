####### Exhibit B

(c)is a statement of project operation and resource utilization. If the project includes more than one dam with associated facilities, the information must be provided separately for each discrete development. The exhibit must contain:

(1) A description of each alternative site considered in selecting of the proposed site;

(2) A description of any alternative facility designs, processes, and operations that were considered.

(3) A statement as to whether operation of the power plant will be manual or automatic, an estimate of the annual plant factor, and a statement of how the project will be operated during adverse, mean, and high water years;

(4) An estimate of the dependable capacity and average annual energy production in kilowatt-hours (or mechanical equivalent), supported by the following data:

(i) The minimum, mean, and maximum recorded flows in cubic feet per second of the stream or other body of water at the powerplant intake or point of diversion, with a specification of any adjustment made for evaporation, leakage minimum flow releases (including duration of releases) or other reductions in available flow; monthly flow duration curves indicating the period of record and the gauging stations used in deriving the curves; and a specification of the critical streamflow used to determine the dependable capacity;

(ii) An area-capacity curve showing the gross storage capacity and usable storage capacity of the impoundment, with a rule curve showing the proposed operation of the impoundment and how the usable storage capacity is to be utilized;

(iii) The estimated minimum and maximum hydraulic capacity of the powerplant in terms of flow and efficiency (cubic feet per second at one-half, full and best gate), and the corresponding generator output in kilowatts;

(iv) A tailwater rating curve; and

(v) A curve showing powerplant capability versus head and specifying maximum, normal, and minimum heads;

(5) A statement of system and regional power needs and the manner in which the power generated at the project is to be utilized, including the amount of power to be used on-site, if any, supported by the following data:

(i) Load curves and tabular data, if appropriate;

(ii) Details of conservation and rate design programs and their historic and projected impacts on system loads; and

(iii) The amount of power to be sold and the identity of proposed purchaser(s); and

(6) A statement of the applicant's plans for future development of the project or of any other existing or proposed water power project on the affected stream or other body of water, indicating the approximate location and estimated installed capacity of the proposed developments.
