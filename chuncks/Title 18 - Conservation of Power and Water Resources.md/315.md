##### Subpart D - Application for Preliminary Permit, License or Exemption: General Provisions
###### § 4.34 Hearings on applications; consultation on terms and conditions; motions to intervene; alternative procedures.
####### Alternative procedures.

(i)(1) An applicant may submit to the Commission a request to approve the use of alternative procedures for pre-filing consultation and the filing and processing of an application for an original, new or subsequent hydropower license or exemption that is subject to § 4.38 or § 16.8 of this chapter, or for the amendment of a license that is subject to the provisions of § 4.38.

(2) The goal of such alternative procedures shall be to:

(i) Combine into a single process the pre-filing consultation process, the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act and administrative processes associated with the Clean Water Act and other statutes;

(ii) Facilitate greater participation by and improve communication among the potential applicant, resource agencies, Indian tribes, the public and Commission staff in a flexible pre-filing consultation process tailored to the circumstances of each case;

(iii) Allow for the preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment by an applicant or its contractor or consultant, or of a preliminary draft environmental impact statement by a contractor or consultant chosen by the Commission and funded by the applicant;

(iv) Promote cooperative efforts by the potential applicant and interested entities and encourage them to share information about resource impacts and mitigation and enhancement proposals and to narrow any areas of disagreement and reach agreement or settlement of the issues raised by the hydropower proposal; and

(v) Facilitate an orderly and expeditious review of an agreement or offer of settlement of an application for a hydropower license, exemption or amendment to a license.

(3) A potential hydropower applicant requesting the use of alternative procedures must:

(i) Demonstrate that a reasonable effort has been made to contact all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and others affected by the applicant's proposal, and that a consensus exists that the use of alternative procedures is appropriate under the circumstances;

(ii) Submit a communications protocol, supported by interested entities, governing how the applicant and other participants in the pre-filing consultation process, including the Commission staff, may communicate with each other regarding the merits of the applicant's proposal and proposals and recommendations of interested entities; and

(iii) Serve a copy of the request on all affected resource agencies and Indian tribes and on all entities contacted by the applicant that have expressed an interest in the alternative pre-filing consultation process.

(4) As appropriate under the circumstances of the case, the alternative procedures should include provisions for:

(i) Distribution of an initial information package and conduct of an initial information meeting open to the public;

(ii) The cooperative scoping of environmental issues (including necessary scientific studies), the analysis of completed studies and any further scoping; and

(iii) The preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement and related application.

(5)(i) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed prior to July 23, 2005, the Commission will give public notice in theinviting comment on the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. The Commission will consider any such comments in determining whether to grant or deny the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. Such a decision will not be subject to interlocutory rehearing or appeal.

(ii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and prior to the deadline date for filing a notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5 of this chapter, the Commission will give public notice and invite comments as provided for in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section. Commission approval of the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures prior to the deadline date for filing of the notification of intent does not waive the potential applicant's obligation to file the notification of intent required by § 5.5 of this chapter and Pre-Application Document required by § 5.6 of this chapter.

(iii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and is at the same time as the notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5, the public notice and comment procedures of part 5 of this chapter shall apply.

(6) If the Commission accepts the use of alternative procedures, the following provisions will apply.

(i) To the extent feasible under the circumstances of the proceeding, the Commission will give notice in theand the applicant will give notice, in a local newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the project is located, of the initial information meeting and the scoping of environmental issues. The applicant will also send notice of these stages to a mailing list approved by the Commission.

(ii) Every six months, the applicant shall file with the Commission a report summarizing the progress made in the pre-filing consultation process and referencing the applicant's public file, where additional information on that process can be obtained. Summaries or minutes of meetings held in the process may be used to satisfy this filing requirement. The applicant must also file with the Commission a copy of its initial information package, each scoping document, and the preliminary draft environmental review document. All filings with the Commission under this section must include the number of copies required by paragraph (h) of this section, and the applicant shall send a copy of these filings to each participant that requests a copy.

(iii) At a suitable location, the applicant will maintain a public file of all relevant documents, including scientific studies, correspondence, and minutes or summaries of meetings, compiled during the pre-filing consultation process. The Commission will maintain a public file of the applicant's initial information package, scoping documents, periodic reports on the pre-filing consultation process, and the preliminary draft environmental review document.

(iv) An applicant authorized to use alternative procedures may substitute a preliminary draft environmental review document and additional material specified by the Commission instead of Exhibit E to its application and need not supply additional documentation of the pre-filing consultation process. The applicant will file with the Commission the results of any studies conducted or other documentation as directed by the Commission, either on its own motion or in response to a motion by a party to the licensing or exemption proceeding.

(v) Pursuant to the procedures approved, the participants will set reasonable deadlines requiring all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and interested persons to submit to the applicant requests for scientific studies during the pre-filing consultation process, and additional requests for studies may be made to the Commission after the filing of the application only for good cause shown.

(vi) During the pre-filing process the Commission may require the filing of preliminary fish and wildlife recommendations, prescriptions, mandatory conditions, and comments, to be submitted in final form after the filing of the application; no notice that the application is ready for environmental analysis need be given by the Commission after the filing of an application pursuant to these procedures.

(vii) Any potential applicant, resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process may file a request with the Commission to resolve a dispute concerning the alternative process (including a dispute over required studies), but only after reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute with other participants in the process. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must document what efforts have been made to resolve the dispute.

(7) If the potential applicant or any resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process can show that it has cooperated in the process but a consensus supporting the use of the process no longer exists and that continued use of the alternative process will not be productive, the participant may petition the Commission for an order directing the use by the potential applicant of appropriate procedures to complete its application. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must recommend specific procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances.

(8) The Commission may participate in the pre-filing consultation process and assist in the integration of this process and the environmental review process in any case, including appropriate cases where the applicant, contractor, or consultant funded by the applicant is not preparing a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement, but where staff assistance is available and could expedite the proceeding.

(9) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in § 4.32(k).
