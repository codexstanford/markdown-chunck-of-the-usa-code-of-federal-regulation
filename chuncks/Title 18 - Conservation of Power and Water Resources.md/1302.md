###### ยง 35.14 Fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clauses.
####### F)

(i) A utility proposing to include purchase charges other than those for fuel or energy in fuel and purchased economic power costs (under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall amend its fuel cost adjustment clause so that it is consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Such amendment shall state the system reserve capacity criteria by which the system operator decides whether a reliability purchase is required. Where the utility filing the statement is required by a State or local regulatory body (including a plant site licensing board) to file a capacity criteria statement with that body, the system reserve capacity criteria in the statement filed with the Commission shall be identical to those contained in the statement filed with the State or local regulatory body. Any utility that changes its reserve capacity criteria shall, within 45 days of such change, file an amended fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clause to incorporate the new criteria.

(ii) Reserve capacity shall be deemed adequate if, at the time a purchase was initiated, the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria were projected to be satisfied for the duration of the purchase without the purchase at issue.
