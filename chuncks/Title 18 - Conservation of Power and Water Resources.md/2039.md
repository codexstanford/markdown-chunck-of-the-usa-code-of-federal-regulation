####### Special rules.

(d)(1) This paragraph applies:

(i) If the rate applicant has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization always been applied; or

(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in, or in excess of, amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities.

(2) The interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component in its cost-of-service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes.

(3) The interstate pipeline must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline for determining the cost-of-service provision described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline, then the interstate pipeline must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of such method will be subject to case-by-case determination.

(4) An interstate pipeline must continue to include, as an addition or reduction to rate base, any deficiency or excess attributable to prior flow-through or changes in tax rates (paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section), until such deficiency or excess is fully amortized in accordance with a Commission approved ratemaking method.
