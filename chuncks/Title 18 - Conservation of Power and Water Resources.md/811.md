####### Investigations.

(d)(1) For any downstream project for which a final charge pursuant to an investigation has never been established, the Commission will conduct an initial investigation to determine a final charge.

(2) The Commission may, for good cause shown by a party or on its own motion, initiate a new investigation of a river basin to determine whether, because of any change in the hydrology, project development, or other characteristics of the river basin that effects headwater benefits, it should:

(i) Establish a new final charge to replace a final charge previously established under ยง 11.17(b)(5); or

(ii) Revise any variable of the headwater benefits formula that has become a constant in calculating a final charge.
