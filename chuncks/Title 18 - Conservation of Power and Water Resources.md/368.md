####### Supporting design report.

(3)The applicant must furnish, at a minimum, the following supporting information to demonstrate that existing and proposed structures are safe and adequate to fulfill their stated functions and must submit such information in a separate report at the time the application is filed. The report must include:

(i) An assessment of the suitability of the site and the reservoir rim stability based on geological and subsurface investigations, including investigations of soils and rock borings and tests for the evaluation of all foundations and construction materials sufficient to determine the location and type of dam structure suitable for the site;

(ii) Copies of boring logs, geology reports and laboratory test reports;

(iii) An identification of all borrow areas and quarry sites and an estimate of required quantities of suitable construction material;

(iv) Stability and stress analyses for all major structures and critical abutment slopes under all probable loading conditions, including seismic and hydrostatic forces induced by water loads up to the Probable Maximum Flood as appropriate; and

(v) The bases for determination of seismic loading and the Spillway Design Flood in sufficient detail to permit independent staff evaluation.

(4) The applicant must submit two copies of the supporting design report described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section at the time preliminary and final design drawings are submitted to the Commission for review. If the report contains preliminary drawings, it must be designated a "Preliminary Supporting Design Report."
