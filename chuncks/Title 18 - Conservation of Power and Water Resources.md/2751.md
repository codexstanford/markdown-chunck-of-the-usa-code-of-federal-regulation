(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, abandonment of transportation services is authorized pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act upon the expiration of the contractual term or upon termination of each individual transportation arrangement authorized under a certificate granted under this section.

(2) Paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply if the individual transportation arrangement is for firm transportation under a contract with a term of one year or more, and the firm shipper:

(i) Exercises any contractual right to continue such service; or

(ii) Gives notice that it wants to continue its transportation arrangement and will match the longest term and highest rate for its firm service, up to the applicable maximum rate under ยง 284.10, offered to the pipeline during the period established in the pipeline's tariff for receiving such offers by any other person desiring firm capacity, and executes a contract matching the terms of any such offer. To be eligible to exercise this right of first refusal, the firm shipper's contract must be for service for twelve consecutive months or more at the applicable maximum rate for that service, except that a contract for more than one year, for a service which is not available for 12 consecutive months, would be subject to the right of first refusal.
