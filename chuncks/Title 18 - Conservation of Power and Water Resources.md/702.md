###### Settlement negotiations.

(g)(1) The Commission will consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests for a short suspension of the procedural schedule for the purpose of participants conducting settlement negotiations, where it determines that the suspension will not adversely affect timely action on a license application. In acting on such requests, the Commission will consider, among other things:

(i) Whether requests for suspension of the procedural schedule have previously been made or granted;

(ii) Whether the request is supported by a consensus of participants in the proceeding and an explanation of objections to the request expressed by any participant;

(iii) The likelihood that a settlement agreement will be filed within the requested suspension period; and

(iv) Whether the requested suspension is likely to cause any new or subsequent license to be issued after the expiration of the existing license.

(2) The Commission reserves the right to terminate any suspension of the procedural schedule if it concludes that insufficient progress is being made toward the filing of a settlement agreement.
