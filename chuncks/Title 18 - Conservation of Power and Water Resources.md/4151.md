####### Effect of errors and irregularities in depositions.

(c)(1) Any objection to the taking of a deposition based on errors or irregularities in notice of the deposition is waived, unless written objection is promptly served on the participant giving the notice.

(2) Any objection to the taking of a deposition based on the disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived, unless the objection is made before the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.

(3) Any objection to the competency of the witness or the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony is not waived by failure to make the objection before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the basis for the objection might have been removed if the objection had been presented at the taking of the deposition.

(4) Any objection to errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions and answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of participants, and errors of any kind that might be obviated, removed or cured if presented at the deposition, is waived unless objection is made at the taking of the deposition.

(5) Any objection based on errors or irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, endorsed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer is waived, unless the objection is made with reasonable promptness after the defect is, or with due diligence should have been, ascertained.
