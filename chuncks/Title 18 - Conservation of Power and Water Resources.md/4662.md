###### ยง 401.108 Filing a request for records.

(a) All requests for Commission records shall be filed in writing delivered to the FOIA Officer, or by mailing it to the Commission. The Commission will supply forms for written requests.

(b) A request for Commission records shall reasonably describe the records being sought, in a way that they can be identified and located. A request should include all pertinent details that will help identify the records sought. A person requesting disclosure of records shall be permitted an opportunity to review them without the necessity for copying them where the records involved contain only disclosable data and information.

(1) If the description is insufficient to locate the records requested, the FOIA Officer will so notify the person making the request and indicate the additional information needed to identify the records requested.

(2) Every reasonable effort shall be made by the staff to assist in the identification and location of the records sought.

(3) In any situation in which it is determined that a request for voluminous records would unduly burden and interfere with the operations of the Commission, the person making the request will be asked to be more specific and to narrow the request, and to agree on an orderly procedure for the production of the requested records.

(c) Upon receipt of a request for records, the FOIA Officer shall enter it in a public log (which entry may consist of a copy of the request). The log shall state the date and time received, the name and address of the person making the request, the nature of the records requested, the action taken on the request, the date of the determination letter sent pursuant to ยง 401.99(b), the date(s) any records are subsequently furnished, the number of staff-hours and grade levels of persons who spent time responding to the request, and the payment requested and received.

(d) A denial of a request for records, in whole or in part, shall be signed by the FOIA Officer. The name and title or position of each person who participated in the denial of a request for records shall be set forth in a letter denying the request. This requirement may be met by attaching a list of such individuals to the letter.
