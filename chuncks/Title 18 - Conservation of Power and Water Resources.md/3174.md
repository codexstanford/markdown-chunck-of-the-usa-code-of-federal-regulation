##### ยง 341.10 Application of rates to intermediate points.
###### Intermediate destination points.

(2)The rate for service provided from a published origin point to a destination point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate to the next more distant destination point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:

(i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more "next more distant" points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.

(ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published destination points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.

(iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published destination points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.

(iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate to the proposed intermediate destination point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply the provisions of this rule to such intermediate point.
