###### Exhibit G-Engineering data.

(g)

(1) A detailed project description including:

(i) Name and destination of the project;

(ii) Design voltage rating (kV);

(iii) Operating voltage rating (kV);

(iv) Normal peak operating current rating;

(v) Line design features for minimizing television and/or radio interference cause by operation of the proposed facilities; and

(vi) Line design features that minimize audible noise during fog/rain caused by operation of the proposed facilities, including comparing expected audible noise levels to the applicable Federal, State, and local requirements.

(2) A conductor, structures, and substations description including:

(i) Conductor size and type;

(ii) Type of structures;

(iii) Height of typical structures;

(iv) An explanation why these structures were selected;

(v) Dimensional drawings of the typical structures to be used in the project; and

(vi) A list of the names of all new (and existing if applicable) substations or switching stations that will be associated with the proposed new transmission line.

(3) The location of the site and right-of-way including:

(i) Miles of right-of-way;

(ii) Miles of circuit;

(iii) Width of the right-of-way;

(iv) A brief description of the area traversed by the proposed transmission line, including a description of the general land uses in the area and the type of terrain crossed by the proposed line;

(4) Assumptions, bases, formulae, and methods used in the development and preparation of the diagrams and accompanying data, and a technical description providing the following information:

(i) Number of circuits, with identification as to whether the circuit is overhead or underground;

(ii) The operating voltage and frequency; and

(iii) Conductor size, type and number of conductors per phase.

(5) If the proposed interconnection is an overhead line, the following additional information also must be provided:

(i) The wind and ice loading design parameters;

(ii) A full description and drawing of a typical supporting structure including strength specifications;

(iii) Structure spacing with typical ruling and maximum spans;

(iv) Conductor (phase) spacing; and

(v) The designed line-to-ground and conductor-side clearances.

(6) If an underground or underwater interconnection is proposed, the following additional information also must be provided:

(i) Burial depth;

(ii) Type of cable and a description of any required supporting equipment, such as insulation medium pressurizing or forced cooling;

(iii) Cathodic protection scheme; and

(iv) Type of dielectric fluid and safeguards used to limit potential spills in waterways.

(7) Technical diagrams that provide clarification of any of the above items should be included.

(8) Any other data or information not previously identified that has been identified as a minimum requirement for the siting of a transmission line in the State in which the facility will be located.
