####### By the petitioner.

(b)(1) Within 15 days after petitioner gives written notice to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199C(b) that petitioner wishes to appeal the remedial order, the petitioner must file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon the Secretary and other participants in the proceedings, an answer to the contested order admitting or denying each of the Secretary's findings in the contested order and setting forth affirmative defenses, if any. Each answer filed with the Secretary of the Commission by the petitioner, in accordance with this paragraph, must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by ยง 381.303 of this chapter.

(2) In the answer, the petitioner may:

(i) Contest any part of the record;

(iii) Request permission to conduct discovery, subject to criteria provided in Rule 908(a) (discovery). Failure by the petitioner to contest the record or to request permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery in this answer constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.
