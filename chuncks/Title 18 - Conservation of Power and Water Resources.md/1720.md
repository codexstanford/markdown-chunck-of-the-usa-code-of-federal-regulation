##### ยง 50.2 Purpose and intent of rules.

(a) The purpose of the regulations in this part is to provide for efficient and timely review of requests for permits for the siting of electric transmission facilities under section 216 of the Federal Power Act.

(b) Every applicant shall file all pertinent data and information necessary for a full and complete understanding of the proposed project.

(c) Every requirement of this part will be considered as an obligation of the applicant which can only be avoided by a definite and positive showing that the information or data called for by the applicable rules is not necessary for the consideration and ultimate determination of the application.

(d) The burden of assuring that all applications and information submitted under this part is in an intelligible form and any omission of data is justified rests with the applicant.
