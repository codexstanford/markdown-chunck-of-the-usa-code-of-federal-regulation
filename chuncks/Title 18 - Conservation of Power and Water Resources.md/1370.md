####### Evidentiary demonstration for wholesale stranded cost recovery.

(2)A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover wholesale stranded costs in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) (v) through (vii) of this section must demonstrate that:

(i) It incurred costs to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer or retail customer based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer;

(ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility, or, in the case of a retail-turned-wholesale customer, had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility; and

(iii) The stranded costs are derived using the following formula: Stranded Cost Obligation = (Revenue Stream Estimate-Competitive Market Value Estimate) x Length of Obligation (reasonable expectation period).
