####### In general.

(a)During a hearing, the hearing of a motion, or an interlocutory proceeding under Rule 715, any part or all of a deposition taken pursuant to Rule 404, so far as admissible as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any participant who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the provisions of this section.

(1) If the deponent is a witness at a hearing, any participant may use the deposition of that witness at the time of the witness' examination to contradict, impeach, or complete the testimony of that witness.

(2) The deposition of a participant or of any person who, at the time of taking the deposition, was an officer, director, or managing agent of a participant, or a person designated under Rule 404(b)(3) to testify on behalf of a participant may be used by another participant for any purpose.

(3) The deposition of any witness, whether or not a participant, may be used by a participant for any purpose, if the presiding officer finds that:

(i) The witness is dead;

(ii) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity or imprisonment;

(iii) The participant offering the deposition is unable after the exercise of due diligence to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or

(iv) Exceptional circumstances make it necessary in the interest of fairness with due regard to the importance of presenting the witness in open hearing, to allow use of the deposition.

(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a participant, a participant may require the introduction of any other part which ought, in fairness, to be considered with the part introduced, and any adverse participant may introduce any other part.
