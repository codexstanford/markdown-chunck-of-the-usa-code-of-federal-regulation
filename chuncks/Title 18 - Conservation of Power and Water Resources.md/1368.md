####### Recovery of wholesale stranded costs,General requirement.

(c)-(1)A public utility or transmitting utility will be allowed to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs only as follows:

(i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff.

(ii) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated with a new wholesale requirements contract if such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision.

(iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections 205-206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for FPA section 205 or 211 transmission services.

(iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs.

(v) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the public utility may seek recovery of stranded costs only as follows:

(A) If either party to the contract seeks a stranded cost amendment pursuant to a section 205 or section 206 filing under the FPA made prior to the expiration of the contract, and the Commission accepts or approves an amendment permitting recovery of stranded costs, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 rates for electric energy.

(B) If the contract is not amended to permit recovery of stranded costs as described in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the public utility may file a proposal, prior to the expiration of the contract, to recover stranded costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to the customer.

(vi) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs through FPA section 211-212 transmission rates.
