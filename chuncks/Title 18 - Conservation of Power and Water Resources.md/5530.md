### PART 1307 - NONDISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO HANDICAP
#### ยง 1307.5 Employment discrimination.
##### Reasonable accommodation.

(e)(1) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the program or activity subject to this part. Reasonable accommodation may include:

(i) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; and

(ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, or other similar actions.

(2) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's program or activity under this paragraph factors to be considered include but are not limited to:

(i) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed, and its effect, if any, on the recipient's programs or activities.

(ii) The kind of operation conducted by the recipient, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and

(iii) The overall size of the recipient's program or activity with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget.

(3) It is not an undue hardship with respect to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the sole basis for the claim of hardship is the need to make an accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the otherwise qualified employee or applicant and the accommodation is deemed by TVA to be reasonable.
