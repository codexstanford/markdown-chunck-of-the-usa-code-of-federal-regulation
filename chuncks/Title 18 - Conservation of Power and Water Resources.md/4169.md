(d)-(1)(i) In the absence of controlling Commission precedent, privileges will be determined in accordance with decisions of the Federal courts with due consideration to the Commission's need to obtain information necessary to discharge its regulatory responsibilities.

(ii) A presiding officer may not quash a subpoena or otherwise deny or limit discovery on the ground of privilege unless the presiding officer expressly finds that the privilege claimed is applicable. If a presiding officer finds that a qualified privilege has been established, the participant seeking discovery must make a showing sufficient to warrant discovery despite the qualified privilege.

(iii) A presiding officer may issue a protective order under Rule 410(c) to deny or limit discovery in order to preserve a privilege of a participant, person, or governmental agency.
