###### Resellers' participation in supplier's offers.

(e)Prior to advertising a "Free" promotion, a supplier should offer the product as promoted to all competing resellers as provided for in the Commission's "Guides for Advertising Allowances and Other Merchandising Payments and Services." In advertising the "Free" promotion, the supplier should identify those areas in which the offer is not available if the advertising is likely to be seen in such areas, and should clearly state that it is available only through participating resellers, indicating the extent of participation by the use of such terms as "some", "all", "a majority", or "a few", as the case may be.
