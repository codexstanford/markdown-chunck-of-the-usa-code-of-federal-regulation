A torque of 4 inch-pounds +/-0.2 inch-pound (4.60 kilogram-centimeters) shall be applied evenly within a period of 5 seconds in a clockwise direction until a rotation of 180 degrees from the original position has been attained or 4 inch-pounds +/-0.2 inch-pound (4.60 kilogram-centimeters) exceeded. The torque or maximum rotation shall be maintained for an additional 10 seconds. The torque shall then be removed and the test component permitted to return to a relaxed condition. This procedure shall then be repeated in a counterclockwise direction.
