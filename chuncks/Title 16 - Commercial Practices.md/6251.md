(d)(1)(i) The garment sampling plan is made up of two parts: (A) Prototype Testing and (B) Production Testing. Prior to production, prototypes must be tested to assure that the design characteristics of the garments are acceptable. Garment Production Units (Units) are then accepted or rejected on an individual Unit basis.

(ii) Edge finishes such as hems and binding are excluded from testing except that when trim is used on an edge the trim must be subjected to prototype testing. Seams attaching findings are excluded from testing.
