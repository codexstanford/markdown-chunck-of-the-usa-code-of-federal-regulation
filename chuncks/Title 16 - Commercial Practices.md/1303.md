(9) All labels on split-system condenser units must contain one of the following three statements:

(i) For labels disclosing only the seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 for cooling, the statement should read:

* Your air conditioner's efficiency rating may be better depending on the coil your contractor installs.

(ii) For labels disclosing both the seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 for cooling and the heating seasonal performance factor 2 for heating, the statement should read:

This system's efficiency ratings depend on the coil your contractor installs with this unit. The heating efficiency rating varies slightly in different geographic regions. Ask your contractor for details.

(iii) For labels disclosing only the heating seasonal performance factor 2 for heating, the statement should read:

This system's efficiency rating depends on the coil your contractor installs with this unit. The efficiency rating varies slightly in different geographic regions. Ask your contractor for details.

(10) The following statement shall appear at the top of the label as illustrated in the sample labels in appendix L of this part:

Federal law prohibits removal of this label before consumer purchase.

(11) For any single-package air conditioner with a minimum Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 (EER2) of at least 10.6, any split system central air conditioner with a rated cooling capacity of at least 45,000 Btu/h and minimum efficiency ratings of at least 13.8 SEER2 and 11.2 EER2 or at least 15.2 SEER2 and 9.8 EER2, and any split-system central air conditioners with a rated cooling capacity less than 45,000 Btu/h and minimum efficiency ratings of at least 14.3 SEER2 and 11.7 EER2 or at least 15.2 SEER2 and 9.8 EER2, the label must contain the following regional standards information:

(i) A statement that reads:

Notice

Federal law allows this unit to be installed in all U.S. states and territories.

(ii) For split systems, a statement that reads:

Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 (EER2): The installed system's minimum EER2 is ____.

(iii) For single-package air conditioners, a statement that reads:

Energy Efficiency Ratio 2 (EER2): This model's EER2 is [____].

(12) For any split system central air conditioner with a rated cooling capacity of at least 45,000 Btu/h and minimum efficiency ratings of at least 13.8 SEER2 but lower than 11.2 EER2 or at least 15.2 SEER2 but lower than 9.8 EER2, and any split-system central air conditioners with a rated cooling capacity less than 45,000 Btu/h and minimum efficiency ratings of at least 14.3 SEER2 but lower than 11.7 EER2 or at least 15.2 SEER2 but lower than 9.8 EER2, the label must contain the following regional standards information:

(i) A statement that reads:
