###### Procedure.

(b)Place the prepared sample in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and cleared after each test. The temperature of the sample at the time of testing shall be between 68 &#xB0;F. and 86 &#xB0;F. Hold a burning paraffin candle whose diameter is at least 1 inch, so that the flame is in contact with the surface of the sample at the end of the major axis for 5 seconds or until the sample ignites, whichever is less. Remove the candle. By means of a stopwatch, determine the time of combustion with self-sustained flame. Do not exceed 60 seconds. Extinguish flame with a COor similar nondestructive type extinguisher. Measure the dimensions of the burnt area and calculate the rate of burning along the major axis of the sample.
