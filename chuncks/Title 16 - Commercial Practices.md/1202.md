####### Automatic clothes washer

(1)means a class of clothes washer which has a control system capable of scheduling a pre-selected combination of operations, such as regulation of water fill level, and performance of wash, rinse, drain and spin functions, without the need for the user to intervene subsequent to the initiation of machine operation. Some models may require user intervention to initiate these different segments of the cycle after the machine has begun operation, but they do not require the user to intervene to regulate the water temperature by adjusting the external water faucet valves.
