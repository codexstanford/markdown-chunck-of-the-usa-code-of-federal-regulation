####### Environmental assessment.

(a)(Section 1508.9 of the NEPA regulations). The assessment is initiated along with the staff development of a proposal and the identification of realistic alternatives. The assessment shall be available to the Commission before the Commission votes on a proposal and its alternatives. Its purpose is to identify and describe foreseeable effects on the environment, if any, of the action and its alternatives. The assessment culminates in a written report. This report generally contains analyses of the same categories of information as would an EIS, but in a much less detailed fashion. (See ยง 1021.10(a), below.) It contains sufficient information to form a basis for deciding whether effects on the environment are likely to be "significant." (See ยง 1508.27 of the NEPA regulations.).
