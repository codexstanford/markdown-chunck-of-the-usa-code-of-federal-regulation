####### dyeing

(d) The term(which includes the processes known in the trade of tipping the hair or fur, feathering, and beautifying) means the process of applying dyestuffs to the hair or fur, either by immersion in a dye bath or by application of the dye by brush, feather, spray, or otherwise, for the purpose of changing the color of the fur or hair, or to accentuate its natural color. When dyestuff is applied by immersion in a dye bath or by application of the dye by brush, feather, or spray, it may respectively be described as "vat dyed", "brush dyed", "feather dyed", or "spray dyed", as the case may be. When dyestuff is applied only to the ends of the hair or fur, by feather or otherwise, it may also be described as "tip-dyed". The application of dyestuff to the leather or the skin (known in the trade as "tipping", as distinguished from tip-dyeing the hair or fur as above described) and which does not affect a change of, nor accentuate the natural color of the hair or fur, shall not be considered as "dyeing". When fluorescent dye is applied to a fur or fur product it may be described as "brightener added".
