####### Alternative methods.

(h)(1) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of the standard. For example, alternatives were considered such as hand probes, "blade harmless" tests, and blade control by engine kill but allowing manual restart. These alternatives have been rejected by the Commission as being either unfeasible or not as effective as the rule which is being issued.

(2) Similarly, the Commission has found no alternative means of achieving the objective of the standard that it believes would have fewer adverse effects on competition or that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices, consistent with the public health and safety.
