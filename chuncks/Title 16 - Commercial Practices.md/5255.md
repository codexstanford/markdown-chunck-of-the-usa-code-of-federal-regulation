###### combustible

(iii) The termshall apply to any substance having a flashpoint at or above 100 &#xB0;F (37.8 &#xB0;C) to and including 150 &#xB0;F (65.6 &#xB0;C) as determined by the test method described at § 1500.43a, except that:

(A) Any mixture having one component or more with a flashpoint higher than 150 &#xB0;F (65.6 &#xB0;C) which comprises at least 99 percent of the total volume of the mixture is not considered to be a combustible hazardous substance; and

(B) Any mixture containing 24 percent or less of water miscible alcohols, by volume, in aqueous solution is not considered to be combustible if the mixture does not present a significant flammability hazard when used by consumers.

(iv) To determine flashpoint temperatures for purposes of enforcing and administering requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act applicable to "extremely flammable," "flammable," and "combustible" hazardous substances, the Commission will follow the procedures set forth in § 1500.43a. However, the Commission will allow manufacturers and labelers of substances and products subject to those requirements to rely on properly conducted tests using the Tagliabue open-cup method which was in effect prior to the issuance of § 1500.43a (as published at 38 FR 27012, September 27, 1973, and set forth below), and the defintions of the terms "extremely flammable," "flammable," and "combustible" in this section before its amendment (as published at 38 FR 27012, September 27, 1983, and amended 38 FR 30105, November 1, 1973, set forth in the note following this section) if all of the following conditions are met:

(A) The substance or product was subject to and complied with the requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act for "extremely flammable," "flammable," or "combustible" hazardous substances before the effective date of § 1500.43a; and

(B) No change has been made to the formulation or labeling of such substance or product after the effective date of § 1500.43a, prescribing a closed-cup test apparatus and procedure.
