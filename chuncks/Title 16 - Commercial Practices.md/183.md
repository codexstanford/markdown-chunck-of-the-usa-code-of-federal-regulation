(1)An application filed by an aggrieved person also must state in no more than 1,000 words the reasons for challenging the sanction and whether the person requests an evidentiary hearing conducted by the Administrative Law Judge; if a hearing is requested, the applicant must state whether the hearing is sought to supplement or to contest facts in the record found by the Authority. Each issue must be plainly and concisely stated. Further, the applicant must provide support for each issue raised, citing to the Authority's record when assignments of error are based on the record, and citing to the principal legal authorities the applicant relies upon, whether statutes, regulations, cases, or other authorities.

Within 10 days of being served with the application, the Authority may file a response limited to no more than 1,000 words stating the reasons the sanction should be upheld and whether an evidentiary hearing conducted by the Administrative Law Judge is either unnecessary, or necessary to supplement or to contest facts in the record found by the Authority.
