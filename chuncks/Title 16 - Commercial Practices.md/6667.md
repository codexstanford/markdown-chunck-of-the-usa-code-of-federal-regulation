####### Gas flow rate.

(x)Use propane gas: The propane shall be minimum 99% pure (often described by suppliers as CP or "chemically pure" grade, but this designation should not be relied on since the actual purity may vary by supplier). Each burner has a specific propane gas flow rate set with its respective, calibrated flowmeter. The gas flow rate to the top burner is 12.9 liters per minute ("L/min") +/-0.1 L/min at a pressure of 101 +/-5 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure) and a temperature of 22 +/-3 &#xB0;C. The gas flow rate to the side burner is 6.6 +/-0.05 L/min at a pressure of 101 +/-5 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure) and a temperature of 22 +/-3 &#xB0;C. The total heat release rate of the burners is 27 kW.
