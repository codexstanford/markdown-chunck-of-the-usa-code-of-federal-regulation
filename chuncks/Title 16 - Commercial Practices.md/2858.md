(3) In 2023, "A" acquires $115 million of voting securities issued by B after submitting its notification and $30,000 filing fee and indicates the $50 million (as adjusted) threshold. Two years later, "A" files to acquire additional voting securities issued by B valued at $114.4 million because it will exceed the next higher reporting threshold (§ 801.1(h) of this chapter). Assuming the second transaction is reportable, and the value of its initial holdings is unchanged (§§ 801.13(a)(2) and 801.10(c) of this chapter), the provisions of § 801.13(a)(1) of this chapter require that "A" report that the total value of the second transaction is $229.4 million, which is in excess of $100 million (as adjusted) notification threshold. This is because "A" must aggregate previously acquired securities in calculating the value of B's voting securities that it will hold as a result of the second acquisition. "A" should pay a filing fee of $100,000 because the total value is greater than $161.5 million but less than $500 million.
