###### ยง 1512.16 Requirements for reflectors.
####### Retroreflective tire sidewalls.

(h)When retroreflective tire sidewalls are used in lieu of spoke-mounted reflectors, the reflecting material shall meet the following requirements:

(1) The retroreflective material shall form a continuous circle on the sidewall.

(2) The retroreflective material shall adhere to the tire such that after the tire has been subjected to a temperature of 50&#xB0; +/-3 &#xB0;C (122&#xB0; +/-5.4 &#xB0;F) for 30 minutes, the retroreflective material cannot be peeled or scraped away without removal of tire material.

(3) The retroreflective material shall be as resistant to abrasion as is the adjacent sidewall material so that when retroreflective material is removed from the inflated tire by abrasion with a wet, steel bristle brush, tire material will be removed along with the retroreflective material.

(4) The retroreflective material shall be tested for performance in accordance with the retroreflective tire test, ยง 1512.18(o), to assure the reflectance properties over the angles given in table 3. When a portion of the retroreflective material is selected (and the remainder is masked as specified in ยง 1512.18(o)(2)(i)), the selected portion shall not contact the ground plane when the assembled bicycle is resting on that plane in any orientation.
