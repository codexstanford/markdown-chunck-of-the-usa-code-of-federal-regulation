###### Drycleaning,General.

(2)-(i)If a drycleaning instruction is included on the label, it must also state at least one type of solvent that may be used. However, if all commercially available types of solvent can be used, the label need not mention any types of solvent. The terms "Drycleanable" or "Commercially Dryclean" may not be used in an instruction. [For example, if drycleaning in perchlorethylene would harm a coat, the label might say "Professionally dryclean: fluorocarbon or petroleum."]
