####### Requests to conduct cross-examination or present rebuttal submissions.

(b)Cross-examination and rebuttal submissions at an informal hearing are available only to address disputed issues of material fact necessary to be resolved.

In determining whether to grant such requests, the presence of the following circumstances indicate that such requests should be granted:

(1) An issue for cross-examination or the presentation of rebuttal submissions, is an issue of specific fact in contrast to legislative fact;

(2) A full and true disclosure with respect to the issue can be achieved only through cross-examination rather than through rebuttal submissions or the presentation of additional oral submissions; and

(3) The particular cross-examination or rebuttal submission is required for the resolution of a disputed issue.
