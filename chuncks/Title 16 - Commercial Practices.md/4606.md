####### General.

(a)Section 14(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2063(a)) requires each manufacturer, importer, or private labeler of a product which is subject to a consumer product safety standard to issue a certificate of compliance with the applicable standard and to base that certificate upon a test of each item or upon a reasonable testing program. Because it is not practical to test each item subject to the standard, a reasonable testing program shall be used to support certificates of compliance for cellulose insulation.
