####### Conditioning.

(f)Test specimens shall be conditioned to equilibrium at 21+/-3 &#xB0;C (69.8+/-5.4 &#xB0;F) and a relative humidity of 50+/-5 percent immediately prior to testing. A less than 1% change in net weight of the specimen in two consecutive weighings with two hours between each weighing constitutes equilibrium. The maximum cumulative time a conditioned sample may be exposed to conditions different from 21+/-3 &#xB0;C (69.8+/-5.4 &#xB0;F) and relative humidity of 50+/-5% before insertion in to the radiant panel chamber for testing is 10 minutes.
