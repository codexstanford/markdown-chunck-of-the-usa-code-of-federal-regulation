##### ยง 1500.43a Method of test for flashpoint of volatile flammable materials.
###### Calculations.

(k)If it is desired to correct the observed finite flashpoint for the effect of barometric pressure, proceed as follows: Observe and record the ambient barometric pressureat the time of the test. If the pressure differs from 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg), correct the flashpoint as follows:

(1) Corrected flashpoint (&#xB0;C) = C + 0.25 (101.3-A)

(2) Corrected flashpoint (&#xB0;F) = F + 0.06 (760-B)

(3) Corrected flashpoint (&#xB0;C) = C + 0.03 (760-B)
