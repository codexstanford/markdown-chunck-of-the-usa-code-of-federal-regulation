###### Serious injury

(f)includes not only the concept of "grievous bodily injury" defined in the Commission's rule for Substantial Hazard Reports at 16 CFR 1115.12(d), but also any other significant injury. Injuries necessitating hospitalization which require actual medical or surgical treatment and injuries necessitating absence from school or work of more than one day are examples of situations in which the Commission shall presume that such a serious injury has occurred.
