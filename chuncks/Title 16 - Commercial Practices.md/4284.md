####### Impact attenuation criteria,General.

(d)-(1)A helmet fails the impact attenuation performance test of this standard if a failure under paragraph (d)(2) of this section can be induced under any combination of impact site, anvil type, anvil impact order, or conditioning environment permissible under the standard, either with or without any attachments, or combinations of attachments, that are provided with the helmet. Thus, the Commission will test for a "worst case" combination of test parameters. What constitutes a worst case may vary, depending on the particular helmet involved.
