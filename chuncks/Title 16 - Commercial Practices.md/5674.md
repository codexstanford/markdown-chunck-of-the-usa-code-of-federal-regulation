(ii)An acceptabletest method or weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended beforedermal irritation testing is considered to determine appropriate cautionary labeling. The weight-of-evidence analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validatedortest results (valid tests are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at:), the substance's dermal toxicity, evidence of corrosivity/irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating low or high pH (&#x2264;2 or ≥11.5) of the substance, and any other relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal corrosive or irritant. If there is any indication from this analysis that the substance is either corrosive or irritating to the skin, the substance should be labeled appropriately. If the substance is not corrosivebut no data exist regarding its irritation potential, human patch testing should be considered. Ifdata are unavailable, human patch testing is not an option, and there are insufficient data to determine the weight-of-evidence, a tieredanimal test is recommended.
