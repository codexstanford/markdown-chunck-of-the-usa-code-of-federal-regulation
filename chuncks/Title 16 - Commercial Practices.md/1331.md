####### e.g.

(i) At 120 volts and followed by the phrase "at 120 volts." In such case, the labels for such lamps also may disclose the lamp's wattage, light output, energy cost, and life at the design voltage (, "Light Output 1710 Lumens at 125 volts"); or

(ii) At the design voltage and followed by the phrase "at (125 volts/130 volts)" if the ratings at 120 volts are disclosed clearly and conspicuously on another panel of the package, and if all panels of the package that contain a claimed light output, energy cost, wattage or lifeclearly and conspicuously identify the lamp as "(125 volt/130 volt)," and if the principal display panel clearly and conspicuously discloses the following statement:

(2) For any covered product that is an incandescent reflector lamp, the required disclosures of light output shall be given for the lamp's total forward lumens.

(3) For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp, the required light output disclosure shall be measured at a base-up position; but, if the manufacturer or private labeler has reason to believe that the light output at a base-down position would be more than 5% different, the label also shall disclose the light output at the base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist, the fact that at a base-down position the light output might be more than 5% less.
