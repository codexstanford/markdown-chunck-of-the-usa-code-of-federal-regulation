###### ยง 1201.40 Interpretation concerning bathtub and shower doors and enclosures.
####### Interpretation.

(b)When the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the Standard, it did not intend the standard to apply to any item of glazing material in a window that is located over a bathtub or within a shower stall and in the exterior wall of a building. The Commission clarifies that the Standard does not apply to such items of glazing material or such windows. This interpretation applies only to the term "bathtub doors and enclosures" and "shower door and enclosure" and does not affect the applicability of the Standard to any other product.
