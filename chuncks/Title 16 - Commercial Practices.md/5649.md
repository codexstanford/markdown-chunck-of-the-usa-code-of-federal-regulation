###### Assessment of Bioavailability.

(2)(i) The need to consider bioavailability in estimating the risk from use of a product containing a toxic substance only arises when it is anticipated that the absorption characteristics of a substance to which there is human exposure will differ from those characteristics for the substance tested in the studies used to define the dose-response relationship.

(ii) In determining the need to assess bioavailability, the factors to be examined include:

(A) The physical or chemical form of the substance,

(B) The route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or through the skin),

(C) The presence of other constituents in the product which interfere with or alter absorption of the toxic substance, and

(D) Dose.
