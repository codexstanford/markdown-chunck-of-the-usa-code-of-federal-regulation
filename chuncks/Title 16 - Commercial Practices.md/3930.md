###### ยง 1115.6 Reporting of unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.
####### Unreasonable risk.

(b)The use of the term "unreasonable risk" suggests that the risk of injury presented by a product should be evaluated to determine if that risk is a reasonable one. In determining whether a product presents an unreasonable risk, the firm should examine the utility of the product, or the utility of the aspect of the product that causes the risk, the level of exposure of consumers to the risk, the nature and severity of the hazard presented, and the likelihood of resulting serious injury or death. In its analysis, the firm should also evaluate the state of the manufacturing or scientific art, the availability of alternative designs or products, and the feasibility of eliminating the risk. The Commission expects firms to report if a reasonable person could conclude given the information available that a product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. In its evaluation of whether a subject firm is required to file a report under the provisions of section 15 of the CPSA the Commission shall, as a practical matter, attach considerable significance if such firm obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product violates a standard or ban promulgated under the FHSA, FFA, PPPA or RSA and the violation could result in serious injury or death.
