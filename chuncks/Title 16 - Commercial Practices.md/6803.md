### Subchapter E - Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 Regulations
#### PART 1700 - POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING
##### ยง 1700.14 Substances requiring special packaging.
###### Over-the-Counter Drug Products.

(30)(i) Any over-the-counter (OTC) drug product in a dosage form intended for oral administration that contains any active ingredient that was previously available for oral administration only by prescription, and thus was required by paragraph (a)(10) of this section to be in special packaging, shall be packaged in accordance with the provisions of ยง 1700.15(a),(b), and (c). This requirement applies whether or not the amount of that active ingredient in the OTC drug product is different from the amount of that active ingredient in the prescription drug product. This requirement does not apply if the OTC drug product contains only active ingredients of any oral drug product or products approved for OTC marketing based on an application for OTC marketing submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by any entity before January 29, 2002. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any special packaging requirement under this ยง 1700.14 otherwise applicable to an OTC drug product remains in effect.
