#### PART 303 - RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER THE TEXTILE FIBER PRODUCTS IDENTIFICATION ACT
##### ยง 303.10 Fiber content of special types of products.

(a) Where a textile product is made wholly of elastic yarn or material, with minor parts of non-elastic material for structural purposes, it shall be identified as to the percentage of the elastomer, together with the percentage of all textile coverings of the elastomer and all other yarns or materials used therein.

(b) Where drapery or upholstery fabrics are manufactured on hand-operated looms for a particular customer after the sale of such fabric has been consummated, and the amount of the order does not exceed 100 yards (91.44 m) of fabric, the required fiber content disclosure may be made by listing the fibers present in order of predominance by weight with any fiber or fibers required to be designated as "other fiber" or "other fibers" appearing last, as for example:

(c)(1) Where a manufactured textile fiber is essentially a physical combination or mixture of two or more chemically distinct constituents or components combined at or prior to the time of extrusion, which components if separately extruded would each fall within different existing definitions of textile fibers as set forth in ยง 303.7 of this part (Rule 7), the fiber content disclosure as to such fiber, shall for all purposes under the regulations in this part

(i) Disclose such fact in the required fiber content information by appropriate nondeceptive descriptive terminology, such as "biconstituent fiber" or "multiconstituent fiber,"

(ii) Set out the components contained in the fiber by the appropriate generic name specified in ยง 303.7 of this part (Rule 7) in the order of their predominance by weight, and

(iii) Set out the respective percentages of such components by weight.
