###### Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

(d)Verification of identity of persons making written requests to the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) ordinarily will not be required. The signature on such requests will be deemed a certification by the signatory that he or she is the individual to whom the record pertains or is the parent or guardian of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom the record pertains. The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) may require additional verification of a requester's identity when such information is reasonably necessary to assure that records are not improperly disclosed; provided, however, that no verification of identity will be required if the records sought are publicly available under the Freedom of Information Act.
