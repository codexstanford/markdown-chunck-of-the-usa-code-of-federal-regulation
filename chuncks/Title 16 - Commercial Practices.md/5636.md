###### Possible Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.

(iii)A substance is considered a "possible human male reproductive toxicant" if there is limited animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed "Possible Positive A" in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. EPA proposes to use either limited human or limited animal evidence data to classify a toxicant as a "Possible Positive A" toxicant. As described above, CPSC would elevate limited human evidence to the category "Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant."
