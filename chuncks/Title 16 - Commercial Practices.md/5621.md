###### Possible Human Carcinogenic Substance ("limited evidence" animal carcinogen).

(3)In the absence of "sufficient" or "limited" human data, agents with "limited" evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies fall into this category. Such substances, and those that do not fall into any other group, are not considered "toxic." This does not imply that the substances are or are not carcinogens, only that the evidence is too uncertain to provide for a determination. This category is similar to EPA's Group C, IARC's Group 3, or ANSI's category 4.
