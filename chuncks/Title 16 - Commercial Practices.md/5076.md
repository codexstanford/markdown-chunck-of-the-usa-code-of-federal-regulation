#### PART 1304 - BAN OF CONSUMER PATCHING COMPOUNDS CONTAINING RESPIRABLE FREE-FORM ASBESTOS
##### ยง 1304.5 Findings.
###### Products subject to the ban.

(b)Consumer patching compounds as defined in ยง 1034.3 (d), (e), (f) includes such products as drywall spackling compounds and tape joint compounds (commonly known as "joint cement" or "tape joint mud"). The Commission estimates annual shipments of patching compounds subject to the ban at approximately 30-50 million "units," or individual packages, of various sizes from 0.5 to 25 pounds (dry) or 0.5 to 5 gallons (wet). The Commission believes that about half the patching compounds sold in 1977, and intended for sale to or use or enjoyment by consumers, were formulated with asbestos. Many others containing significant levels of asbestos contamination will also be affected by the ban.
