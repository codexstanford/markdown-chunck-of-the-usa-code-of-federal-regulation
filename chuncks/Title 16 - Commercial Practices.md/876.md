###### Specifying driving modes for fuel economy estimates.,i.e.,

(f)If an advertiser cites an EPA fuel economy estimate, it should identify the particular type of driving associated with the estimate (estimated city, highway, or combined MPG). Advertisements failing to do so can deceive consumers who incorrectly assume the disclosure applies to a specific type of driving, such as combined or highway, which may not be the driving type the advertiser intended. Thus, such consumers may believe the model's fuel economy rating is higher than it actually is.
