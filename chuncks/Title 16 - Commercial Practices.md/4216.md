(3) Eye injuries sustained by persons who use bookmatches that fragment and cause particles from such matches to lodge in a person's eye.

(4) Burn injuries sustained by persons who use bookmatches that, when struck, ignite the remaining matches in the matchbook.

(5) Burn injuries sustained by persons from fires that have resulted from unexpected ignition of bookmatches with no deliberate action by the user.
