###### ยง 1115.6 Reporting of unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.
####### Serious injury or death.

(c)The term "serious injury" is not defined in the CPSA. The Commission believes that the term includes not only the concept of "grievous bodily injury," defined at ยง 1115.12(d), but also any other significant injury. Injuries necessitating hospitalization which require actual medical or surgical treatment, fractures, lacerations requiring sutures, concussions, injuries to the eye, ear, or internal organs requiring medical treatment, and injuries necessitating absence from school or work of more than one day are examples of situations in which the Commission shall presume that such a serious injury has occurred. To determine whether an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death exists, the firm should evaluate chronic or long term health effects as well as immediate injuries.
