##### ยง 1500.135 Summary of guidelines for determining chronic toxicity.
###### Developmental Toxicants.

(2)Substances are toxic by reason of their potential developmental or reproductive toxicity when they meet the "sufficient evidence" or "limited evidence" criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in humans, or when they meet the "sufficient evidence" criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in animals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) have developed categories for teratogens but not other developmental toxicants. The teratogen guidelines limit the information only to structural birth defects and do not include other hazards of developmental toxicity such as embryonal death, fetal death, or functional deficiencies which are also important in assessing the overall toxicity of a substance when administered during pregnancy. Recently, EPA has proposed a system for classifying developmental toxicity. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not yet developed any classification for developmental toxicity. The commission has established the following categories for determination of developmental toxicity according to the available evidence.
