(c) The termmeans the lowest temperature corrected to a pressure of 101.3 RPa (1013 millibars) of a substance at which application of an ignition source causes the vapor above the substance to ignite under specified conditions of test. A blue light (blue halo) or other colored light which sometimes surrounds the test flame should not be confused with the true ignition of the vapors (flash point).
