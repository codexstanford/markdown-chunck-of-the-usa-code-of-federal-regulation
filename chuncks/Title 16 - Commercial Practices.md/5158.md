##### ยง 1406.1 Scope, purpose, and effective date.
###### Purpose.

(b)This regulation is intended to reduce the unreasonable risk of injury from fire associated with inadequate information provided with coal and wood burning appliances. This rule does not replace any voluntary standards applicable to these appliances or any state or local requirements applicable to the installation, use, or maintenance of such appliances that are not inconsistent with this rule. Thus, for example, a local code could require the actual installation of appliances at different distances from combustibles than those specified on the label required by this rule, and voluntary standards or local codes could require labeling or instructions in addition to those required by this rule. The fact that a product complies with this regulation is not intended to be a substitute for the performance tests and other criteria established by listing organizations whose approval is required to meet some state or local requirements applicable to these appliances.
