(3)With the toy rigidly fastened in any reasonable test position, the clamp is fastened to the test object or component. A torque of 2 inch-pounds +/-0.2 inch-pound (2.30 kilogram-centimeters) shall be applied evenly within a period of 5 seconds in a clockwise direction until a rotation of 180 degrees from the original position has been attained or 2 inch-pounds (2.30 kilogram-centimeters) exceeded. The torque or maximum rotation shall be maintained for an additional 10 seconds. The torque shall then be removed and the test component permitted to return to a relaxed condition. This procedure shall then be repeated in a counterclockwise direction.
