####### Timing.

(c)To the extent practicable, the Commission will transmit a report of harm to the manufacturer or private labeler within five business days of submission of the completed report of harm. If the Commission cannot determine whom the manufacturer or private labeler is from the report of harm, or otherwise, then it will not post the report of harm on the Database but will maintain the report for internal agency use. Examples of circumstances that may arise that may make transmission of the report of harm impracticable within five business days include, but are not limited to:

(1) The manufacturer or private labeler is out of business with no identifiable successor;

(2) The submitter misidentified a manufacturer or private labeler;

(3) The report of harm contained inaccurate or insufficient contact information for a manufacturer or private labeler; or

(4) The Commission cannot locate valid contact information for a manufacturer or private labeler.
