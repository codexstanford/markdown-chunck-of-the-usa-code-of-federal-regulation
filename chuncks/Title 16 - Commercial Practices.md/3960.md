####### Freedom of Information Act.

(b)Any person who submits information to the Commission who believes that any portion of the information is entitled to exemption from public disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 552(b)), of the CPSA, as amended, or of another Federal statute must accompany the submission with a written request that the information be considered exempt from disclosure or indicate that a written request will be submitted within 10 working days of the submission. The request shall (1) identify the portions of the information for which exemption is claimed, which may include the identity of the reporting firm and the fact that it is making a report, and (2) state the facts and reasons which support the claimed exemption. After the staff has made its preliminary hazard determination, and regardless of whether or not the staff preliminarily determines that a product presents a substantial product hazard, the Commission will no longer honor requests for exempt status for the identity of the reporting firm, the identity of the consumer product, and the nature of the reported alleged defect or noncompliance. This information, together with the staff's preliminary hazard determination, will be made available to the public in the Commission's public reading room. Information for which exempt status is claimed (such as alleged trade secrets, confidential commercial or financial information, or information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy) shall not be released to the public except in accordance with the applicable statute or the Commission's Freedom of Information Act regulations (16 CFR part 1015).
