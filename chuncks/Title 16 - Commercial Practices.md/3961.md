####### Section 6(b) of the CPSA.

(c)The Commission believes that the first two sentences in section 6(b)(1) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2055(b)(1)) apply to affirmative dissemination of information by the Commission (such as press releases or fact sheets distributed to the public) from which the public may ascertain readily the identity of the product's manufacturer and/or private labeler. Manufacturers and private labelers will ordinarily be given 30 days' notice before the Commission makes such affirmative disseminations. However, this 30-day notice will not apply if the Commission finds that a lesser notice period is required in the interest of public health and safety.
