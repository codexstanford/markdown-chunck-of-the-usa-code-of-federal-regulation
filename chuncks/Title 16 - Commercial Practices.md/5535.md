(2)The toy shall be secured in a vise equipped with vise shields that are fabricated from 13-gauge cold-rolled steel or other similar material and that have a 0.375-inch (0.95-centimeter) inside radius. The component shall then be bent through a 60-degree arc by a force applied at a point on the component 2 inches (5 centimeters) from the intersection of the component with the main body of the toy or applied at the end of the component if the component is less than 2 inches (5 centimeters) long. The component shall then be bent in the reverse direction through a 120-degree arc. This process shall be repeated for 30 cycles at a rate of one cycle per two seconds with a 60-second rest period occurring after each 10 cycles. Two 120-degree arc bends shall constitute one cycle.
