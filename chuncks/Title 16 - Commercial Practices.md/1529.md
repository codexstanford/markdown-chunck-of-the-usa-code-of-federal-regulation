####### Vehicle fuel tank capacity

(dd)means the tank's usable capacity (i.e., the volume of fuel that can be pumped into the tank through the filler pipe with the vehicle on a level surface and with the unusable capacity already in the tank). The term does not include unusable capacity (i.e., the volume of fuel left at the bottom of the tank when the vehicle's fuel pump can no longer draw fuel from the tank), the vapor volume of the tank (i.e., the space above the fuel tank filler neck), or the volume of the fuel tank filler neck.
