###### Relationship of benefits to costs.

(C)The Commission estimates that the ban will reduce the potential for exposure to lead and resulting lead poisoning because there is no "safe" level of lead in the blood. The annual cost to the candle/wick industry of the ban is estimated by the Commission to be in the range of $100,000 to $300,000. On a percentage basis these costs represent only 0.005 to 0.015 percent of the overall value of candle shipments in 2000, which was approximately $2 billion. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
