(e)At the point determined by the test described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section to be the most severe, weight is to be added to the door in 5.0 pound (2.26 Kg) increments and the tests of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are to be repeated until a total of 15.0 pounds (66.72 N) has been added to the door. Before performing each test cycle, the door is to be cycled 2 times to update the profile.
