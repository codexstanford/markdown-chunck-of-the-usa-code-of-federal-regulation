####### Revalidation testing.

(d)(1) In order to assure a continued satisfactory correlation between the alternate laundering procedure and the laundering procedure of the standard, applicants shall perform all the testing described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for fabrics or garments from current production at least once for every three-month period during which any of the fabric or garments are produced.

(2) If following initial approval, four successive comparisons of the alternate and the 50-cycle methods as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, consistently show acceptable results under the criteria specified by paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission will deem such comparisons to be sufficient demonstration of the equivalence of the alternate laundering procedure with the 50 launderings required in the standard and further revalidation testing will not be required.

(3) Records of revalidation testing need not be submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance. However such records must be maintained in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
