###### Comparing different model types.,i.e.,

(h)Fuel economy estimates are assigned to specific model types under 40 CFR part 600, subpart D (unique combinations of car line, basic engine, and transmission class). Therefore, advertisers citing MPG ratings for certain models should ensure that the rating applies to the model type depicted in the advertisement. It is deceptive to state or imply that a rated fuel economy figure applies to a vehicle featured in an advertisement if the estimate does not apply to vehicles of that model type.
