####### Data collection and recording.

(g)Except for recording the times required for the children to activate the signal, recording of data should be avoided while the children are trying to operate the multi-purpose lighters, so that the tester's full attention is on the children during the test period. If actual testing is videotaped, the camera shall be stationary and shall be operated remotely in order to avoid distracting the children. Any photographs shall be taken after actual testing and shall simulate actual test procedure(s) (for example, the demonstration). The following data shall be collected and recorded for each child in the 100-child test panel:

(1) Sex (male or female).

(2) Date of birth (month, day, year).

(3) Age (in months, to the nearest month).

(4) The number of the multi-purpose lighter tested by that child.

(5) Date of participation in the test (month, day, year).

(6) Location where the test was given (city, state, and the name of the site).

(7) The name of the tester who conducted the test.

(8) The elapsed time at which the child achieved any operation of the surrogate signal in the first 5-minute test period.

(9) The elapsed time at which the child achieved any operation of the surrogate signal in the second 5-minute test period.

(10) For a single pair of children from each 100-child test panel, photograph(s) or video tape to show how the multi-purpose lighter was held in the tester's hand, and the orientation of the tester's body and hand to the children, during the demonstration.
