### Subchapter B - Consumer Product Safety Act Regulations
#### PART 1145 - REGULATION OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO OTHER ACTS UNDER THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY ACT
##### ยง 1145.4 Consumer patching compounds containing respirable free-form asbestos; risk of cancer associated with inhalation of asbestos fibers.

(a) The Commission finds that it is in the public interest to regulate the risk of cancer associated with inhalation of asbestos fibers from consumer patching compounds containing respirable free-form asbestos under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) rather than under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) because of the desirability of avoiding possibly lengthy resource-consuming, inefficient rulemaking proceedings under the FHSA and because of the availability of civil penalties under the CPSA for knowing noncompliance.

(b) Therefore, consumer patching compounds containing respirable free-form asbestos are regulated under CPSA.
