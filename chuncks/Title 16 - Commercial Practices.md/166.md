####### Conclusory statements and failure to provide requisite analysis.

(e)Information required to be submitted under this section must be sufficiently detailed and contain sufficient analysis to support a Commission finding that a proposed rule or modification satisfies the statutory requirements. For instance, a mere assertion or conclusory statement that a proposed rule or modification is consistent with the requirements of the Act is insufficient. Failure to describe and justify the proposed rule or modification in the manner described in this section or failure to submit the information required by this section may result in the Commission's having insufficient information to make an affirmative finding that the proposed rule or modification is consistent with the Act and the applicable rules approved by the Commission.
