###### ยง 1112.13 How does a third party conformity assessment body apply for CPSC acceptance?
####### Statement of scope.

(ii)The third party conformity assessment body's accreditation must include a statement of scope that clearly identifies each CPSC rule and/or test method for which CPSC acceptance is sought. Although a third party conformity assessment body may include more than one CPSC rule and/or test method in its scope in one application, it must submit a new application if the CPSC has already accepted the third party conformity assessment body for a particular scope, and the third party conformity assessment body wishes to expand its acceptance to include additional CPSC rules and/or test methods.
