####### Insulating material.

(e)(1) Material to be used for mounting uninsulated live electrical elements shall be generally accepted as suitable for the specific application, particularly with regard to electrical insulation (voltage breakdown) and good aging characteristics (no significant change in insulating characteristics over the expected lifetime of the toy).

(2) Material used to insulate a heating element from neighboring parts shall be suitable for the purpose. If plain asbestos in a glass braid is used to so insulate the heating element, it shall be tightly packed and totally enclosed by the braid, and the overall thickness, including the braid, shall not be less than one-sixteenth inch. Hard fiber may be used for electrically insulating bushings, washers, separators, and barriers, but is not sufficient as the sole support of uninsulated live metal parts.
