###### Known Human carcinogenic Substances ("sufficient evidence" in humans).

(1)Substances are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity when they meet the "sufficient evidence" criteria of carcinogenicity from studies in humans, which require that a causal relationship between exposure to an agent and cancer be established. This category is similar to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Group A, the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) Group 1, or the American National Standards Institute's (ANSI) Category 1. A causal relationship is established if one or more epidemiological investigations that meet the following criteria show an association between cancer and exposure to the agent.

(i) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.

(ii) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.

(iii) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.
