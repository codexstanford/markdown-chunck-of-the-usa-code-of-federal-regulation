###### Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.

(ii)A substance is considered a "probable human male reproductive toxicant" if there is "limited" human evidence or "sufficient" animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed "Probable Positive" in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. However, the EPA category is based only on sufficient animal evidence. CPSC believes that limited human evidence is also sufficient for a chemical to be placed in this category.
