###### Probable Human Carcinogenic Substances.

(2)Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable carcinogenicity when they meet the "limited evidence" criteria of carcinogenicity in humans or the "sufficient evidence" criteria of carcinogenicity in animals described below. This category is similar to EPA's Group B, IARC's Group 2, or ANSI's Categories 2 and 3. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. For example, such evidence would result when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes cancer in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation. It is reasonable, for practical purposes, to regard an agent for which there is "sufficient" evidence of carcinogenicity in animals as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to humans.
