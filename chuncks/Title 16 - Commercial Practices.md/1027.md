(a) No misleading nor deceptive statements as to the construction of fur products shall be used directly or indirectly in labeling, invoicing or advertising such products. (For example, a fur product made by the skin-on-skin method should not be represented as having been made by the letout method.)

(b) Where a fur product is made by the method known in the trade as letting-out, or is made of fur which has been sheared or plucked, such facts may be set out in labels, invoices and advertising.
