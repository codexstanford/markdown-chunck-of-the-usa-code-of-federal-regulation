###### Testing procedure.

(b)The device shall be placed on a smooth surface that can be inclined at 60 degrees from the horizontal, as shown in Figure 1 of this section. The height and width of the inclined plane (not including the portion of the plane below the mechanical stop) shall be at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) greater than the largest dimension of the base of the device to be tested. The test shall be conducted on a smooth, hard surface that is horizontal as measured by a spirit level or equivalent instrument. The mechanical stop on the inclined plane shall beinches (1.6 mm) in height and perpendicular to the inclined plane. The stop shall be positioned parallel to the bottom edge of the inclined plane and so that no portion of the device to be tested or its base touches the horizontal surface. The device shall not tip over when the plane is inclined at 60-degrees from the horizontal. The procedure shall be repeated for each edge of the device.
