####### Impact velocity.

(3)The helmet shall be dropped onto the flat anvil with an impact velocity of 6.2 m/s+/-3% (20.34 ft/s+/-3%). (Typically, this requires a minimum drop height of 2 meters (6.56 ft), plus a height adjustment to account for friction losses.) The helmet shall be dropped onto the hemispherical and curbstone anvils with an impact velocity of 4.8 m/s+/-3% (15.75 ft/s+/-3%). (Typically, this requires a minimum drop height of 1.2 meters (3.94 ft), plus a height adjustment to account for friction losses.) The impact velocity shall be measured during the last 40 mm (1.57 in) of free-fall for each test.
