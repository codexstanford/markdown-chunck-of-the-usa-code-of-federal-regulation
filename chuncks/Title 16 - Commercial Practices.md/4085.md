##### ยง 1119.4 Factors considered in determining civil penalties.
###### Nature of the product defect.

(3)The Commission will consider the nature of the product defect associated with a CPSA violation. This consideration will include, for example, whether the defect arises from the product's design, composition, contents, construction, manufacture, packaging, warnings, or instructions, and will include consideration of conditions or circumstances in which the defect arises. The Commission will also consider the nature of the substance associated with an FHSA violation. Two of the statutory factors in the CPSA civil penalty factors include the terms "product defect" or "defective products." However, certain violations of the CPSA, for example, failing to supply a required certificate that the product complies with an applicable consumer product safety rule, do not necessarily require that there be a product defect or defective product. The terms "product defect" or "defective products" would not apply to such situation. In such cases, however, the other civil penalty factors would still be considered.
