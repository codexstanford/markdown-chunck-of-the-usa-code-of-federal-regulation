(a)(see ยง 1213.3(a)(6)). With no mattress on the bed, place the wedge block shown in Figure 1, tapered side first, into each opening in the bed structure below the lower edge of the uppermost member of the guardrail and above the underside of the upper bunk's foundation. Orient the block so that it is most likely to pass through the opening (the major axis of the block parallel to the major axis of the opening) ("most adverse orientation"). Then gradually apply a 33-lbf (147-N) force in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the large end of the block. Sustain the force for 1 minute.
