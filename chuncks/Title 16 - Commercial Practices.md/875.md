###### Disclosing EPA test as source of fuel economy and driving range estimates.

(e)Advertisers citing any EPA fuel economy or driving range figures should identify EPA as the source of the test so consumers understand that the estimate is comparable to EPA estimates for competing models. Doing so prevents deception by ensuring that consumers do not associate the claimed ratings with a test other than the EPA-required procedures. Advertisers may avoid deception by stating that the values are "EPA estimate(s)," or equivalent language that identifies the EPA test as the source.
