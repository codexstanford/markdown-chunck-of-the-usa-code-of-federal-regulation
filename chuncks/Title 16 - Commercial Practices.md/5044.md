##### ยง 1302.5 Findings.
###### Probable effect of the ban on the availability of contact adhesives to meet the need of the public.

(4)The Commission estimates that the ban will not have any effect on the availability or use of contact adhesives. Manufacturers are most likely to switch production to flammable petroleum-based and to 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (1,1,1,-TCE) based or water-based contact adhesives.
