##### ยง 1500.43a Method of test for flashpoint of volatile flammable materials.
###### Preparation of samples.

(f)(1) Erroneously high flashpoints may be obtained if precautions are not taken to avoid the loss of volatile material. In preliminary tests of materials taken directly from the container, do not open containers unnecessarily and make a transfer unless the sample temperature is at least 10 &#xB0;C (18 &#xB0;F) below the expected flashpoint. Do not use samples in leaky containers for this test.

(2) Do not store samples in plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.) bottles since volatile material may diffuse through the walls of the bottle.

(3) A 2-ml specimen is required for each test. If possible, obtain at least a 50-ml sample from the bulk test site and store in a clean, tightly closed container.
