(1) For any manufacturer or private labeler knowingly to distribute in commerce any new covered product unless such covered product is marked and/or labeled in accordance with this part with a marking, label, hang tag, or energy fact sheet which conforms to the provisions of the Act and this part.

(2) For any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler knowingly to remove or render illegible any marking or label required to be provided with such product by this part.

(3) For any manufacturer or private labeler knowingly to distribute in commerce any new covered product, if there is not included (i) on the label, (ii) separately attached to the product, or (iii) shipped with the product, additional information relating to energy consumption or energy efficiency which conforms to the requirements in this part.

(b) Subject to enforcement penalties assessed per model per day of violation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6303 and adjusted for inflation by § 1.98 of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or private labeler knowingly to:
