###### ยง 1209.6 Test procedures for critical radiant flux.
####### Apparatus and description of test procedure.

(a)Test chamber (Figures 3 and 4 paragraph (b) of this section). An air-gas fueled radiant heat energy panel or equivalent panel inclined at 30&#xB0; above and directed at a horizontally-mounted attic floor insulation specimen. The radiant panel generates a radiant energy flux distribution ranging along the approximately 100-cm length of the test specimen from a nominal maximum of 1.0 W/cm.to a minimum of 0.1 W/cm. The test is initiated by open flame ignition from a pilot burner. The distance burned to flame-out is converted to W/cmfrom the flux profile graph (Figure 8) and reported as critical radiant flux, W/cm. Section 1209.8 provides a procedure for calibrating the radiation pyrometer used to standardize the thermal output of the panel.
