####### Revalidation testing failures.

(e)(1) If revalidation testing for any fabric or garment does not meet the criteria of ยง 1616.32(f), the applicant must immediately discontinue use of the alternate laundering procedure for the fabric or garment and must immediately notify the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance in writing of the failure to meet the criteria. Also the testing from the production unit from which the non-correlating samples were taken and the testing from subsequent production units (if any) must be repeated immediately using the laundering procedure prescribed in the standard. These repeat tests shall then be the tests applicable to such production unit(s) and those tests previously performed on the production unit(s) shall be considered invalid.

(2) When use of an alternate laundering procedure for a particular fabric or garment has been discontinued because of a failure to meet the criteria of ยง 1616.32(f), the alternate laundering procedure shall not be used again unless a new application for approval is submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance and that officer approves the application in writing. In addition to the other information required for applications, the additional application should give facts or reasons showing why the applicant believes the procedure should be considered reliable with the fabric or garments involved, in view of the previous failure.
