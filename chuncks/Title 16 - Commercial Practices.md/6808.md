#### PART 1700 - POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING
##### ยง 1700.14 Substances requiring special packaging.
###### e.g.,

(i) Products in packages in which the only non-child-resistant access to the contents is by a spray device (aerosols, or pump-or trigger-actuated sprays where the pump or trigger mechanism has either a child-resistant or permanent attachment to the package).

(ii) Products from which the liquid cannot flow freely, including but not limited to makeup removal pads. For the purposes of this requirement, hydrocarbons are defined as substances that consist solely of carbon and hydrogen. For products that contain multiple hydrocarbons, the total percentage of hydrocarbons in the product is the sum of the percentages by weight of the individual hydrocarbon components.
