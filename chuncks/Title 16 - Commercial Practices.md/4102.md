###### Stock window covering,see

(f)(also known as a stock blind, shade, or shading) has the same meaning as defined in section 3, definition 5.02, of ANSI/WCMA A100.1-2018 (incorporated by reference; see ยง 1120.4), as a window covering that is completely or substantially fabricated prior to being distributed in commerce and is a specific stock-keeping unit (SKU). Even when the seller, manufacturer, or distributor modifies a pre-assembled product by adjusting to size, attaching the top rail or bottom rail, or tying cords to secure the bottom rail, the product is still considered stock. Online sales of the product or the size of the order such as multi-family housing do not make the product a non-stock product. These examples are provided in ANSI/WCMA A100.1-2018 (incorporated by reference;ยง 1120.4) to clarify that as long as the product is "substantially fabricated" prior to distribution in commerce, subsequent changes to the product do not change its categorization.
