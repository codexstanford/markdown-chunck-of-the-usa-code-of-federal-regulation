(h)(1) The Commission is aware of six relevant standards, four domestic and two international, that address the magnet ingestion hazard. One standard is mandatory, ASTM F963-17,(incorporated by reference at §§ 1262.4 and 1250.2 of this chapter). The other voluntary standards include: ASTM F2923-20,ASTM F2999-19,ASTM F3458-21,(see § 1262.4 for the availability of ASTM standards from ASTM International); EN-71-1: 2014,(available from EN European Standards; Krimicka 134, 318 00 Pilsen, Czech Republic, phone: 420 377 921 379;); and ISO 8124-1: 2018,(available from International Organization for Standardization; Chemin de Blandonnet 8, CP 401-1214 Vernier, Geneva, Switzerland; phone: 41 22 749 01 11;).

(2) The Commission finds that compliance with existing standards is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury associated with ingestion of subject magnet products.
