###### ยง 1616.4 Sampling and acceptance procedures.
####### General.

(a)(1) The test criteria of ยง 1616.3(b) shall be used in conjunction with the following fabric and garment sampling plan. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may consider and approve other sampling plans that provide at least the equivalent level of fire safety to the consumer, provided such alternate sampling plans have operating characteristics such that the probability of unit acceptance at any percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding probability of unit acceptance of the following sampling plan in the region of the latter's operating characteristic curves that lies between 5 and 95 percent acceptance probability. Alternate sampling plans approved for one manufacturer may be used by other manufacturers without prior Consumer Product Safety Commission approval.

(2) Different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric may be included in a single fabric or garment production unit, provided such colors or print patterns demonstrate char lengths that are not significantly different from each other as determined by previous testing of at least three samples from each color or print pattern to be included in the unit.

(3) Garments with different trim and findings may be included in a single garment production unit provided the other garment characteristics are identical except for size, color, and print pattern.
