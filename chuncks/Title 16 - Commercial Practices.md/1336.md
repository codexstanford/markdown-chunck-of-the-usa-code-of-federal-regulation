####### Package labeling.

(3)For purposes of labeling under this section, packaging for metal halide lamp fixtures consists of the plastic sheeting, or "shrink-wrap," covering pallet loads of metal halide lamp fixtures as well as any containers in which such metal halide lamp fixtures are marketed individually or in small numbers. The encircled capital letter "E" on packages containing metal halide lamp fixtures must appear conspicuously, in color-contrasting ink, on the surface of the package on which printing or a label normally appears. If the package contains printing on more than one surface, the label must appear on the surface on which the product inside the package is described. The encircled capital letter "E" may be printed on the surface of the package, printed on a label containing other information, printed on a separate label, or indelibly stamped on the surface of the package. In the case of pallet loads containing metal halide lamp fixtures, the encircled capital letter "E" must appear conspicuously, in color-contrasting ink, on the plastic sheeting, unless clear plastic sheeting is used and the encircled capital letter "E" is legible underneath this packaging.
