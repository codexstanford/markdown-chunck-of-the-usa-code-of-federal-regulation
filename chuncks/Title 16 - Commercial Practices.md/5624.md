###### Probable Neurotoxic Substances.

(2)Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable neurotoxicity when they meet the "limited evidence" criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or the "sufficient evidence" criteria derived from animal studies. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. Such evidence would result, for example, when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes neurotoxicity in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation.
