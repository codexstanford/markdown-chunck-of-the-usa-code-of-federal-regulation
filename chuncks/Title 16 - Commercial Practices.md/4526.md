(B)Rotate the assembled slide into the horizontal position on its side on a loading dock or other platform. Move the slide into such a position that the entire handrail assembly overhangs the platform and level the slide. Fasten the slide firmly in this position and attach a 115-pound (52.2-kg) weight to point D, as shown in figure F, and check for any visible permanent deformation of the handrail at point A. If none exists, the handrails pass this performance test.
