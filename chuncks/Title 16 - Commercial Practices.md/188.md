###### ยง 1.146 Review of civil sanction by an Administrative Law Judge.
####### Hearings for which neither a party nor the Commission requests to supplement or contest the facts found by the Authority and whose record the Administrative Law Judge deems sufficient.

(3)When neither a party nor the Commission requests to supplement or alter the factual record before the Authority, and the Administrative Law Judge has not determined the factual record is insufficient, the factual record will be deemed closed, and no evidentiary hearing will be held. In such cases, the administrative hearing conducted by the Administrative Law Judge will be limited to briefing by the parties, unless the Administrative Law Judge elects to hear oral argument. Within 30 days of the application for review, each party will concurrently file with the Secretary for consideration by the Administrative Law Judge proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a proposed order, together with a supporting legal brief providing the party's reasoning. Such filings, limited to 7,500 words, must be served on the other party and contain references to the record and authorities on which they rely. Reply findings of fact, conclusions of law, and briefs, limited to 2,500 words, may be filed by each party within 10 days of service of the initial filings.
