###### Sharp point test method,Principle of operation.

(d)-(1)The principle of operation of the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section is as follows (Detailed engineering drawings for a suggested sharp point tester are available from the Commission's Office of the Secretary.): A rectangular opening measuring 0.040 inch (1.02 millimeters) wide by 0.045 inch (1.15 millimeters) long in the end of the slotted cap establishes two reference dimensions. Depth of penetration of the point being tested determines sharpness. If the point being tested can contact a sensing head that is recessed a distance of 0.015 inch (0.38 millimeter) below the end cap and can move the sensing head a further 0.005 inch (0.12 millimeter) against a 0.5-pound (2.2-newton) force of a return spring, the point shall be identified as sharp. A sharp point tester of the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this section or one yielding equivalent results shall identify a sharp point. In conducting tests to determine the presence of sharp points, the Commission will use the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section and the accessibility probes designated as A or B in figure 2 of this section.
