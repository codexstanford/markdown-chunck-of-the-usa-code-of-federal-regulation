(ii) If your State law limits or prohibits "as is" sales of vehicles, that State law overrides this part and this rule does not give you the right to sell "as is." In such States, the heading "As Is-No Dealer Warranty" and the paragraph immediately accompanying that phrase must be deleted from the form, and the following heading and paragraph must be substituted as illustrated in the Buyers Guide in Figure 2. If you sell vehicles in States that permit "as is" sales, but you choose to offer implied warranties only, you must also use the following disclosure instead of "As Is-No Dealer Warranty" as illustrated by the Buyers Guide in Figure 2.ยง 455.5 for the Spanish version of this disclosure.
