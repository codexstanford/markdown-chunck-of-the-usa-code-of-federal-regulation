####### Internal clearance procedures.

(c)Section 6(b)(6) requires the Commission to establish internal clearance procedures for Commission initiated disclosures of information that reflect on the safety of a consumer product or class of products, even if the information is not product specific. This rule does not address section 6(b)(6) because the Commission has internal clearance procedures in its directives system.
