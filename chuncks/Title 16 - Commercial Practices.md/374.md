###### ยง 3.35 Interrogatories to parties.
####### Scope; use at hearing.

(b)(1) Interrogatories may relate to any matters that can be inquired into under ยง 3.31(c)(1), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.

(2) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed, but in no case later than 3 days before the final prehearing conference.
