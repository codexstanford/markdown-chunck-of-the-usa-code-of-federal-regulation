## Chapter II - Consumer Product Safety Commission
### Subchapter C - Federal Hazardous Substances Act Regulations
#### PART 1500 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND ARTICLES: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS
##### § 1500.17 Banned hazardous substances.

(a) Under the authority of section 2(q)(1)(B) of the act, the Commission declares as banned hazardous substances the following articles because they possess such a degree or nature of hazard that adequate cautionary labeling cannot be written and the public health and safety can be served only by keeping such articles out of interstate commerce:

(1) Mixtures that are intended primarily for application to interior masonry walls, floors, etc., as a water repellant treatment and that are "extremely flammable" within the meaning of section 2(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(10)).

(2) Carbon tetrachloride and mixtures containing it (including carbon tetrachloride and mixtures containing it used in fire extinguishers), excluding unavoidable manufacturing residues of carbon tetrachloride in other chemicals that under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use do not result in an atmospheric concentration of carbon tetrachloride greater than 10 parts per million.

(3) Fireworks devices intended to produce audible effects (including but not limited to cherry bombs, M-80 salutes, silver salutes, and other large firecrackers, aerial bombs, and other fireworks designed to produce audible effects, and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks) if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 2 grains of pyrotechnic composition; except that this provision shall not apply to such fireworks devices if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) Such fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior (or by equivalent State or local government agencies); and

(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control are unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.14(b)(7); § 1500.17(a) (8) and (9); § 1500.83(a)(27); § 1500.85(a)(2); and part 1507).

(4) Liquid drain cleaners containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium and/or potassium hydroxide; except that this subparagraph shall not apply to such liquid drain cleaners if packaged in accordance with a standard for special packaging of such articles promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-601, 84 Stat. 1670-74 (15 U.S.C. 1471-76)).

(5) Products containing soluble cyanide salts, excluding unavoidable manufacturing residues of cyanide salts in other chemicals that under reasonable and foreseeable conditions of use will not result in a concentration of cyanide greater than 25 parts per million.

(6)(i) Any paint or other similar surface-coating material intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in or around the household that:

(A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or

(B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.

(C) [Reserved]

(D) The provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section do not apply to artists' paints and related materials.

(ii) Any toy or other article intended for use by children that:

(A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or

(B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.

(iii) Since the Commission has issued comprehensive regulations for lead-containing paint and certain consumer products bearing such paint at the 0.06 percent level under the Consumer Product Safety Act (see 16 CFR part 1303), paragraphs (i) and (ii) of § 1500.17(a)(6) are revoked as to the subject products manufactured after February 27, 1978.

(7) General-use garments containing asbestos (other than garments having a bona fide application for personal protection against thermal injury and so constructed that the asbestos fibers will not become airborne under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use).

(8) Firecrackers designed to produce audible effects, if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 50 milligrams (.772 grains) of pyrotechnic composition (not including firecrackers included as components of a rocket), aerial bombs, and devices that may be confused with candy or other foods, such as "dragon eggs," and "cracker balls" (also known as "ball-type caps"), and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks except such devices which meet all of the following conditions:

(i) The fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of Interior (or by equivalent State or local governmental agencies); and

(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control is unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (9)).

(9) All fireworks devices, other than firecrackers, including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks, not otherwise banned under the act, that do not comply with the applicable requirements of part 1507 of this chapter, except fireworks devices which meet all the following conditions:

(i) The fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior (or by equivalent State or local government agencies); and

(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control is unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (8)).

(10) Self-pressurized products intended or suitable for household use that contain vinyl chloride monomer as an ingredient or in the propellant manufactured or imported on or after October 7, 1974. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (8)).

(11)(i) Reloadable tube aerial shell fireworks devices that use shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter and that are imported on or after October 8, 1991.
