####### The factual record.

(2)In reviewing the final civil sanction and decision of the Authority, the Administrative Law Judge may rely in full or in part on the factual record developed before the Authority through the disciplinary process under 15 U.S.C. 3057(c) and disciplinary hearings under Authority Rule Series 8300. The record may be supplemented by an evidentiary hearing conducted by the Administrative Law Judge to ensure each party receives a fair and impartial hearing. Within 20 days of the filing of an application for review, based on the application submitted by the aggrieved party or by the Commission and on any response by the Authority, the Administrative Law Judge will assess whether:

(i) The parties do not request to supplement or contest the facts found by the Authority;

(ii) The parties do not seek to contest any facts found by the Authority, but at least one party requests to supplement the factual record;

(iii) At least one party seeks to contest any facts found by the Authority;

(iv) The Commission, if it filed the application for review, seeks supplementation of the record; or

(v) In the Administrative Law Judge's view, the factual record is insufficient to adjudicate the merits of the review proceeding.
