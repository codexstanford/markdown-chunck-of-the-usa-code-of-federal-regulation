(b)Under 15 U.S.C. 3058(b)(2)(A), the Administrative Law Judge must determine when reviewing matters under this subpart:

(1) Whether the person has engaged in such acts or practices, or has omitted such acts or practices, as the Authority has found the person to have engaged in or omitted. In making this determination, the Administrative Law Judge may rely on the factual record developed before the Authority and may supplement that record by evidence presented in an administrative hearing under paragraph (c) of this section;
