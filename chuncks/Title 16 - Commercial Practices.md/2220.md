#### PART 453 - FUNERAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES
##### ยง 453.3 Misrepresentations.
###### Preventive requirement.

(2)To prevent these deceptive acts or practices, funeral providers must place the following disclosure on the outer burial container price list, required by ยง 453.2(b)(3)(i), or, if the prices of outer burial containers are listed on the general price list, required by ยง 453.2(b)(4), in immediate conjunction with those prices: "In most areas of the country, state or local law does not require that you buy a container to surround the casket in the grave. However, many cemeteries require that you have such a container so that the grave will not sink in. Either a grave liner or a burial vault will satisfy these requirements." The phrase "in most areas of the country" need not be included in this disclosure if state or local law in the area(s) where the provider does business does not require a container to surround the casket in the grave.
