#### PART 802 - EXEMPTION RULES
##### ยง 802.1 Acquisitions of goods in the ordinary course of business.

Pursuant to section 7A(c)(1) of the Clayton Act (the "Act"), acquisitions of goods transferred in the ordinary course of business are exempt from the notification requirements of the Act. This section identifies certain acquisitions of goods that are exempt as transfers in the ordinary course of business. This section also identifies certain acquisitions of goods that are not in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, do not qualify for the exemption.
