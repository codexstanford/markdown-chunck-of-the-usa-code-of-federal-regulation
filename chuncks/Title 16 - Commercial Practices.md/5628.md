###### Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity,Definitions of "Sufficient" and "Limited" Evidence.

(c)-(1)The following definitions apply to all categories stated below.

(i) "Sufficient evidence" from human studies for a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental or reproductive toxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria:

(A) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.

(B) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.

(C) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.

(ii) "Limited evidence" from human studies exists when the human epidemiology meets all but one of the criteria for "sufficient evidence"; i.e., the statistical evidence is borderline as opposed to clear-cut, there is a source of bias, or there are confounding factors that have not been and cannot be accounted for.

(iii) "Sufficient evidence" from animal studies exists when

(A) Obtained from a good quality animal study; and

(B) The substance has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in multiple endpoints in a single species/strain, or in the incidence of a single endpoint at multiple dose levels or with multiple routes of administration in a single species/strain, or increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in multiple species/strains/ experiments.

(iv) "Limited evidence" from animal studies exists when:

(A) Obtained from a good quality study and there is a statistically significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in a single species/strain/experiment at a single dose level administered through only one route and such evidence otherwise does not meet the criteria for "sufficient evidence"; or

(B) The evidence is derived from studies which can be interpreted to show positive effects but have some qualitative or quantitative limitations with respect to experimental procedures (e.g., doses, exposure, follow-up, number of animals/group, reporting of the data, etc.) which would prevent classification of the evidence in the group of "sufficient evidence."
