(2)The impact medium shall consist of a-inch (0.3-centimeter) nominal thickness of type IV vinyl-composition tile, composition 1-asbestos free, as specified by paragraphs 1.2 and 3.1.4 of Interim Amendment-1(YD), dated November 14, 1979, to the Federal Specification entitled Tile, Floor: Asphalt, Rubber, Vinyl, Vinyl-Asbestos, SS-T-312B, dated October 10, 1974,over at least a 2.5-inch (6.4-centimeter) thickness of concrete.
