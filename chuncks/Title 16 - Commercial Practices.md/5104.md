##### ยง 1306.4 Findings.
###### Conclusion.

(f)The Commission finds:

(1) That this rule, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or adequately reduce the unreasonable risk of skull puncture wounds to children associated with lawn darts and will also eliminate or reduce the other injuries, including puncture wounds, that have been associated with this product.

(2) That issuance of the rule is in the public interest.

(3) That no feasible consumer product safety standard would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk associated with lawn darts.

(4) That the benefits expected from this rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.

(5) That the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.
