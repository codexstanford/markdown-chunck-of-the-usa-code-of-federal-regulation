###### Known Neurotoxic Substances ("sufficient evidence in humans").

(1)Substances are toxic by reason of their neurotoxicity and are considered "known neurotoxic substances" when they meet the "sufficient evidence" criteria of neurotoxicity derived from studies in humans which require that a causal association between exposure to an agent and neurotoxicity be established with a reasonable degree of certainty. Substances in this category meet the definition of "neurotoxic" as stated above. "Sufficient evidence," derived from human studies, for a causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria.

(i) A consistent pattern of neurological dysfunction is observed.

(ii) The adverse effects/lesions account for the neurobehavioral dysfunction with reasonable certainty.

(iii) All identifiable bias and confounding factors are reasonably discounted after consideration.

(iv) The association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance, based on statistical analysis.
