####### Admissibility.

(ii)Only relevant, material, and reliable evidence will be admitted. Evidence, even if relevant, may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion of the issues, or if the evidence would be misleading, cause undue delay, waste time, or present duplicative evidence. Evidence that constitutes hearsay may be admitted if it is relevant, material, and bears satisfactory indicia of reliability.
