###### ยง 1025.32 Written interrogatories to parties.
####### Scope of interrogatories.

(c)Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under ยง 1025.31(c), and the answers may be used to any extent permitted under these rules. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory would involve an opinion or contention which relates to fact or to the application of law to fact, but the Presiding Officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a later time.
