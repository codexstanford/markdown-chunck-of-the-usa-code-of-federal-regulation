###### Testing high-viscosity liquids.

(n)(1) High-viscosity materials may be added to the cup by the following procedure:

(i) Back load a 5 or 10-ml syringe with the sample to be tested and extrude 2 ml into the cup. Spread the specimen as evenly as possible over the bottom of the cup.

(ii) If the sample cannot be loaded into a syringe and extruded, other means of adding the sample to the cup may be used such as a spoon. Add approximately 2 ml of material to the spoon and then push the material from the spoon into the cup.

(iii) If the test specimen does not close the sampling port in the cup, seal the cup externally by suitable means.

(2) Using the appropriate procedure, either Method A in ยง 1500.43a(i) or Method B in ยง 1500.43a(j), determine the flashpoint of the specimen which has been added to the tester in accordance with ยง 1500.43a(n)(i), except that the time specified is increased from 1 to 5 minutes for samples at or above ambient temperature.
