###### Known Human Developmental Toxicant ("sufficient evidence in humans").

(i)A substance is considered a "known human developmental toxicant" if there is "sufficient" human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity manifested by death of the conceptus (embryo or fetus), or structural or functional birth defects. This category (Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to category 1 of the EEC and categories D and X of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens. This category is also comparable to the category "definitive evidence for human developmental toxicity" proposed by EPA.
