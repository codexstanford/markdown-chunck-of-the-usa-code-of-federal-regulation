(iii)The T head of the side surface burner (vertical burner) shall be constructed similarly to the top surface burner, as shown in Figure 4 of this part, except that its overall length shall be 254 +/-2 mm (10 +/-0.08 in). Each side of the burner head shall contain 14 holes spaced evenly over a 110 mm length (8.5 mm +/-0.1 mm apart; 0.333 +/-0.005 in). The holes shall be 1.45 mm to 1.53 mm (0.058 in to 0.061 in) in diameter (which corresponds to Grade 10 machining practice with a well formed #53 drill bit). The holes shall point 5&#xB0; out of the plane of the diagram in Figure 4.
