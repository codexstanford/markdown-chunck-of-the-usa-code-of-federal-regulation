() If the number of days obtained by subtracting the days in the birth date from the days in the test date is + 16 or more, 1 month is added to the number of months obtained above. If the number of days is -16 or less, subtract 1 month. If the number of days is between -15 and + 15 inclusive, no change is made in the number of months. Thus, for the example given above, the number of days is -20, and the number of months is therefore 50 - 1 = 49 months.
