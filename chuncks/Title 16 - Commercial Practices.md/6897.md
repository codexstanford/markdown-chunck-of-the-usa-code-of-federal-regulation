###### Test for knob torque.

(b)The measurement of the turning moment required to operate the knob release shall be made with a torque gage adapted for attachment to the knob or knob shaft. The gage shall have a calibrated accuracy within +/-0.011 newton-meter (0.10 inch-pound) when measuring a moment of 0.57 newton-meter (5 inch-pounds). The finest graduations on the dial of the gage shall correspond to a moment increment not greater than 0.011 newton-meter (0.10 inch-pound) and the full-scale range shall not exceed 1.13 newton-meters (10 inch-pounds) in each direction from the null reading. The turning moment shall be applied so as to rotate the knob the full amount required for release, in both a clockwise and a counterclockwise direction. The angle of rotation required for release shall be checked by means of an angle gage adapted to measure the angle of rotation about the longitudinal axis of the knob shaft. The gage shall have a calibrated accuracy within +/-1&#xB0; at an angle of 45&#xB0; and the finest divisions shall not exceed 1&#xB0;. The requirements of ยง 1750.5(a)(2) shall be satisfied.
