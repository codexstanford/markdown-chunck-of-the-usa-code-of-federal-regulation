###### Business hour

means an hour between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., during a weekday (Monday through Friday), excluding Federal holidays. "Business hour" also may include, at the seller's option, a prescriber's regular business hours on Saturdays, provided that the seller has actual knowledge of these hours. "Business hour" shall be determined based on the time zone of the prescriber.

"Eight (8) business hours" shall be calculated from the time the prescriber receives the prescription verification information from the seller, and shall conclude when eight (8) business hours have elapsed. For verification requests received by a prescriber during non-business hours, the calculation of "eight (8) business hours" shall begin at 9 a.m. on the next weekday that is not a Federal holiday or, if applicable, on Saturday at the beginning of the prescriber's actual business hours.
