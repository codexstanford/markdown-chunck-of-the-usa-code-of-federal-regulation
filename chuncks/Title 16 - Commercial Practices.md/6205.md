(a) The following shall constitute reasonable and representative tests, as that term is used in section 8 of the Act, for those textile fabrics which by reason of their composition, construction, finish type or weight may be tested upon a class basis. The word "class" as used in this section means a category of textile fabrics having certain general constructional or finished characteristics, sometimes in association with a particular fiber, and covered by a class or type description generally recognized by the trade. In certain instances the use of class tests is restricted by this section to a particular textile fabric of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. The results of such class tests may be used by any person as a basis for furnishing guaranties under section 8 of the Act on all textile fabrics of the same class.
