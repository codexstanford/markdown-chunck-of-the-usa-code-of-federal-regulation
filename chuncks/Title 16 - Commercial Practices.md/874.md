###### Identifying fuel economy and driving range ratings as estimates.

(d)Advertisers citing EPA fuel economy or driving range figures should disclose that these numbers are estimates. Without such disclosures, consumers may incorrectly assume that they will achieve the mileage or range stated in the advertisement. In fact, their actual mileage or range will likely vary for many reasons, including driving conditions, driving habits, and vehicle maintenance. To address potential deception, advertisers may state that the values are "EPA estimate(s)," or use equivalent language that informs consumers that they will not necessarily achieve the stated MPG rating or driving range.
