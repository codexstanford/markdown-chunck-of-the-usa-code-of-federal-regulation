For this test, the edge sensor is to be cycled by the repetitive application of the force as described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section but at room temperature only. The force is to be applied to the same location for the entire test. For an edge sensor system employing integral electric contact strips, this test shall be conducted with the contacts connected to a load no less severe than it controls in the operator. For the last 50 cycles of operation, the sensor shall function as intended when connected to an operator.
