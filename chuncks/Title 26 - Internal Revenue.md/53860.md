###### § 1.1502-94 Coordination with section 382 and the regulations thereunder when a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group.
####### End of separate tracking of certain losses.

(4)If § 1.1502-96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies to a new loss member, then, while that member remains a member of the consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to its attributes described in § 1.1502-96(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i) (or that member has an ownership change under § 1.1502-96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the new loss member has had an ownership change before § 1.1502-96(a) applies, see § 1.1502-96(c) for the continuing application of the section 382 limitation with respect to the member's pre-change losses.
