CFC also earns 50,000u from the sale of personal property to a related person for use outside of Country X that gives rise to foreign base company sales income under section 954(d). Finally, CFC earns 45,000u for performing consulting services outside of Country X for related persons that gives rise to foreign base company services income under section 954(e).
