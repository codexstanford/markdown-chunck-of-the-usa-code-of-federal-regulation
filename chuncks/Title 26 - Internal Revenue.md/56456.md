####### Method of allocation and selection,Allocation to borrowed shares and individual and nonindividual pools.,i.e.,,1,2

(ii)-(A)With respect to each substitute payment in lieu of a dividend received by a broker, the broker must allocate the transferred shares (the shares giving rise to the substitute payment) among all shares of stock of the same class and issue as the transferred shares which were () borrowed by the broker, and () which the broker holds (or has transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and is authorized by its customers to transfer (including shares of stock of the same class and issue held for the broker's own account) ("loanable shares"). The broker may first allocate the transferred shares to any borrowed shares. Then to the extent that the number of transferred shares exceeds the number of borrowed shares (or if the broker does not allocate to the borrowed shares first), the broker must allocate the transferred shares between two pools, one consisting of the loanable shares of all individual customers (the "individual pool") and the other consisting of the loanable shares of all nonindividual customers (the "nonindividual pool"). The transferred shares must be allocated to the individual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by individual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker. Similarly, the transferred shares must be allocated to the nonindividual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by nonindividual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker.
