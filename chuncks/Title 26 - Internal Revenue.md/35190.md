###### ยง 1.861-17 Allocation and apportionment of research and experimental expenditures.
####### 3,Apportionment based on gross receipts.

()After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $45,000x ($90,000x-$45,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Although X has gross intangible income of $190,000x from domestic sales and $20,000x in royalties from Y, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to that gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X and Y (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Even though a portion of the R&E expenditures that must be apportioned are attributable to research performed with respect to steam turbines, and Y does not sell steam turbines, because Y is reasonably expected to license all intangible property related to SIC code category 351 from X, including intangible property related to steam turbines, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section $11,250x ($45,000x x $300,000x/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income attributable to the royalty income to which the gross receipts of Y are related. The remaining $33,750x ($45,000x x ($500,000x + $400,000x)/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source gross income.
