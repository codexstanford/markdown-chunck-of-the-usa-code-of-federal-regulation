##### ยง 32.2 Railroad retirement taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.
###### Sickness or accident disability.

(d)For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a payment made on account of sickness or accident disability includes any payment for personal injuries or sickness includible in gross income under section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder and thus does not include-

(1) Any amount which is expended for medical care as described in section 105(b) and ยง 1.105-2,

(2) Any payment which is unrelated to absence from work as described in section 105(c) and ยง 1.105-3, or

(3) Any payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee as determined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of ยง 1.105-1.

An employee who elects to reduce his compensation or to forgo an increase in his compensation under a salary reduction agreement with an employer will not be deemed to have made employee contributions to the sickness or accident disability plan or system if the employee is not subject to income or railroad retirement taxes on the reduction in compensation.

A tax which is paid by an employee to fund a State temporary disability insurance program is considered a contribution by the employee for purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
