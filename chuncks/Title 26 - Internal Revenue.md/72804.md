######## Example 4.

(iv)D was a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership reports a loss of $100,000 on its partnership return for 2018. In 2020, Partnership files an AAR under section 6227 reporting that the amount of the loss on its 2018 partnership return is $90,000, rather than $100,000 as originally reported. Pursuant to section 6227, Partnership elects to have its partners take the adjustment into account, and furnishes D a statement showing D's share of the reduced loss for 2018. D fails to take his share of the reduced loss for 2018 into account in accordance with section 6227. D has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because D has not taken into account his share of the loss in a manner consistent with how Partnership treated such items on the partnership return actually filed.
