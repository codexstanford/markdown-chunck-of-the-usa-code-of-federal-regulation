### Subchapter B - Estate and Gift Taxes

###### ยง 25.2512-5A Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred before May 1, 2009.
####### Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred before January 1, 1952.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in ยง 25.2512-5(b), if the transfer was made before January 1, 1952, the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. If the valuation of the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or more lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 4 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies for each life involved from values that are based upon the "Actuaries' or Combined Experience Table of Mortality, as extended." This table and many additional factors are described in former ยง 86.19 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 81 edition revised as of April 1, 1958). The present value of an interest measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 4 percent a year.
