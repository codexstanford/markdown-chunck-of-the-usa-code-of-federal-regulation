####### Losses incurred are reduced by salvage.

(c)Under section 832(b)(5)(A), losses incurred are computed by taking into account losses paid reduced by salvage and reinsurance recovered, the change in discounted unpaid losses, and the change in estimated salvage and reinsurance recoverable. For purposes of section 832(b)(5)(A)(iii), estimated salvage recoverable includes all anticipated recoveries on account of salvage, whether or not the salvage is treated, or may be treated, as an asset for state statutory accounting purposes. Estimates of salvage recoverable must be based on the facts of each case and the company's experience with similar cases. Except as otherwise provided in guidance published by the Commissioner in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, estimated salvage recoverable must be discounted either-

(1) By using the applicable discount factors published by the Commissioner for estimated salvage recoverable; or

(2) By using the loss payment pattern for a line of business as the salvage recovery pattern for that line of business and by using the applicable interest rate for calculating unpaid losses under section 846(c). For purposes of section 832(b)(5)(A) and the regulations thereunder, the term "salvage recoverable" includes anticipated recoveries on account of subrogation claims arising with respect to paid or unpaid losses.
