####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, in determining the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) that is attributable to the CFC2 Distribution, all members of the P group are treated as a single United States shareholder for purposes of determining the part of Year 2 during which such shareholder did not own the stock of CFC2. Thus, the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that such United States shareholder did not own the stock of CFC2 to the total number of days in Year 2 is 0/365. The amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) is $0, M2's pro rata share of CFC2's subpart F income for Year 2 is $80x ($80x-$0), and M2 must include $80x in its gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A).
