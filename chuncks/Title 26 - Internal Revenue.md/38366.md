####### Analysis.

(ii)The $50x of interest is foreign personal holding company income in CFC2's hands because section 954(c)(3)(A)(i) (same country exception for interest payments) and section 954(c)(6) do not apply, because the interest payment is allocable to and reduces CFC1's subpart F income. The $50x of interest income is also passive category income to CFC2 because CFC1 and CFC2 are related look-through entities within the meaning of paragraph (i)(1) of this section and, therefore the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section apply to characterize the interest payment. However, because CFC2 is a financial services entity, under ยง 1.904-4(e)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the income is treated as financial services income and therefore as general category income in CFC2's hands. Thus, with respect to CFC2, under ยง 1.904-4(d) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP includes in its gross income a $50x general category inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) attributable to the general category foreign personal holding company income.
