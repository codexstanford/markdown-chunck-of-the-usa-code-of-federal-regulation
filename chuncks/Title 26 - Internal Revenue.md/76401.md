##### Definitions
###### ยง 301.7701(i)-2 Special rules for portions of entities.
####### Assets unlikely to service obligations.

(2)A portion does not include assets that are unlikely to produce any significant cash flows for the holders of the debt obligations. This paragraph applies even if the holders of the debt obligations are legally entitled to cash flows from the assets. Thus, for example, even if the sale of a building would cause a series of debt obligations to be redeemed, the building is not included in a portion if it is not likely to be sold.
