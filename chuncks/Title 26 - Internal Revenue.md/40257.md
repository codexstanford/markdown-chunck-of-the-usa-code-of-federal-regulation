()The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset E is $600x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $60x with respect to Asset E. Of the $60x depreciation with respect to Asset E, $20x is allowed as a deduction, $24x is capitalized to inventory of Product A, and $16x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. FC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E is $10x ($20x x 0.5), $8x of which is allocated and apportioned to FC's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3). None of the $24x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $16x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining FC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $12x ($24x x 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $3x ($6x x 0.5).
