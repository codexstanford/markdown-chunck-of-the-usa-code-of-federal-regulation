####### ยง 301.6721-1 Failure to file correct information returns.
######## Example 3.

(iii)In calendar year 2024, Corporation U timely files on paper 12 Forms 1099-MISC for the 2023 calendar year with correct information. Under ยง 301.6011-2, a person required to file at least 10 returns during calendar year 2024 must file those returns electronically. Corporation U does not correct its failures to file these returns electronically by August 1, 2024. See section 6721(b)(2). Corporation U is therefore subject to a penalty for a failure to file timely under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, under section 6724(c) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the penalty for a failure to file timely electronically applies only to the extent the number of returns exceeds 10. As Corporation U was required to file 12 returns electronically, it is subject to a penalty of $500 for two returns ($250 x 2 = $500).
