####### Alternative facts.

(iv)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(13)(i) of this section, except that at the end of year 2, FScontributes cash to HPSin exchange for additional equity of HPS. As a result of the contribution, FS's interest in HPSincreases from 20 percent to 30 percent, and P's interest in HPSdecreases from 80 percent to 70 percent. P's interest in HPSis reduced within a single 12-month period by 12.5 percent (10/80), as compared to P's interest in HPSas of the beginning of such 12-month period. Accordingly, pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(4)(iii), the exception to foreign use provided under ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(4)(i) does not apply. Therefore, in year 2 there is a foreign use of the $80x year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's Country X separate unit. Such foreign use constitutes a triggering event in year 2 and the $80x year 1 dual consolidated loss is recaptured. Alternatively, if FSwere a domestic corporation, there would not be a foreign use of the $80x year 1 dual consolidated loss because the loss would not be available to offset income that, under U.S. tax principles, is income of a foreign corporation or a direct or indirect owner of an interest in a hybrid entity that is not a separate unit.
