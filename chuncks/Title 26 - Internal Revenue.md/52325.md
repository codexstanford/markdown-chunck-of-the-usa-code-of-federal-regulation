####### Multiple or successive intercompany transactions.

(4)If a member's intercompany item or corresponding item affects the accounting for more than one intercompany transaction, appropriate adjustments are made to treat all of the intercompany transactions as transactions between divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells property to M, and M sells the property to B, then S, M, and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of applying the rules of this section. Similar principles apply with respect to intercompany transactions that are part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, if S sells separate properties to different members as part of the same plan or arrangement, all of the participating members are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the attributes (which might also affect timing) of the intercompany items and corresponding items from each of the properties.
