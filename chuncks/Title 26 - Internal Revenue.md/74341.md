(g)Under the laws of such State, the State tax treatment of-

(1) Partnerships and partners,

(2) Trusts and their beneficiaries,

(3) Estate and their beneficiaries,

(4) Electing small business corporations (within the meaning of section 1371(a) and their shareholders, and

(5) Any other entity and the individuals having beneficial interests therein (such as a cooperative corporation and its shareholders), to the extent that such entity is treated as a conduit for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 1, corresponds to the tax treatment provided therefor with respect to the taxes imposed by chapter 1. For example, a subchapter S corporation shall not be subject to the State's corporate income tax on amounts which are includible in shareholders incomes which are subject to that State's individual income tax, except to the extent that the subchapter S corporation is subject to tax under Federal law. Similarly, a partnership shall not be subject to the State's unincorporated business income tax on amounts which are includible in partners' incomes which are subject to that State's individual income tax. However, the laws of the State which set forth the provisions of such State individual income tax shall authorize the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to require that the conduit entities described in this paragraph (or some of them) supply information to the Federal Government with respect to the source of income, the State of residence, or the amount of income of a particular type, of an individual, estate, or trust holding a beneficial interest in such conduit entity.
