####### Manner of making election.

(b)(1) The election provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by the taxpayer filing a statement in writing that he elects to treat the deduction allowed in a prior taxable year for the unconstitutional tax as not having been allowable for such taxable year. Such a statement must be filed with the taxpayer's return for the taxable year in which the recovery of the unconstitutional tax or taxes occurs. No other method of making the election is permitted. The statement of election must contain a description of the tax recovered, the date of recovery, the taxable year in which paid or accrued, and the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed. The statement of election must also contain a statement signifying the taxpayer's consent (i) to treat the deduction or portion thereof allowed in a prior year with respect to the unconstitutional tax as not allowable for that year and (ii) to the assessment, in respect of the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed, of any deficiency, together with interest thereon as provided by law, resulting from disallowance of the deduction or portion thereof, even though the statutory period for the assessment of any such deficiency may have expired before the filing of such consent.
