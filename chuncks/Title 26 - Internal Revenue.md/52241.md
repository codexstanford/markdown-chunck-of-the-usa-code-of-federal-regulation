####### Section 355.

(D)If B distributes the T stock in an intercompany transaction to which section 355 applies (including an intercompany transaction to which 355 applies because of the application of paragraph (f)(3) of this section), the redetermination of the basis of the T stock under section 358 could cause S's gain or loss to be taken into account under this section. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(D) applies to treat B's distribution as subject to sections 301 and 311 (as modified by this paragraph (f)), rather than section 355. The election will prevent S's gain or loss from being taken into account immediately to the extent matching remains possible, but B's gain or loss from the distribution will also be taken into account under this section.
