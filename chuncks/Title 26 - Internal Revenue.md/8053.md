###### ยง 1.163(j)-3 Relationship of the section 163(j) limitation to other provisions affecting interest.
####### Section 469.

(v)After applying the section 163(j) limitation, D applies section 469 to determine if any amount of D's expense is a disallowed passive activity loss. For Year 2, D has $262x of passive expenses, determined by adding D's business interest expense deduction allowed by section 163(j) ($102x), D's section 162 expense carried forward from Year 1 under section 469 ($145.45x), and D's interest expense carried forward from Year 1 under section 469 which is not business interest expense in Year 2, or $14.55x ($102x + $145.45x + $14.55x). Therefore, D has $238x of net passive income in Year 2, determined by reducing D's total passive income in Year 2 ($500x), by D's disallowed passive activity loss, or $262x ($500x-$262x). D does not have a passive activity loss in Year 2, and no part of D's $262x of passive expenses is disallowed in Year 2 under section 469.
