(B)() Country A Business's activities comprise a trade or business conducted outside the United States within the meaning of ยง 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(3) (in each case, as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section). PRS does not maintain a separate set of books and records with respect to the Country A Business. However, under paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(C) of this section, the Country A Business's activities are deemed to satisfy the requirement of ยง 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) that a QBU maintain a separate set of books and records with respect to the relevant activities. Thus, for purposes of this paragraph (f), the activities of the Country A Business constitute a QBU as defined in ยง 1.989-1(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section, that conducts a trade or business outside the United States. Accordingly, the activities of the Country A Business constitute a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. PRS, the person that owns the Country A Business, is the foreign branch owner, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, with respect to the Country A Business.
