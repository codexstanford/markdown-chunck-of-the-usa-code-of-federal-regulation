####### Manner of computing tax.

(a)If a beneficiary has elected under section 669(a) to compute the tax on the amounts deemed distributed under section 666 by the short-cut throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(B), the tax liability of the beneficiary for the taxable year is computed in the following manner:

(1) First, determine the number of preceding taxable years of the trust, on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed. In any case where there has been a prior accumulation distribution with respect to which the beneficiary has elected to compute his tax either by the exact throwback method or by the short-cut throwback method, or to which the next to the last sentence of section 668(a) has applied, for purposes of an election to use the short-cut throwback method with respect to a subsequent accumulation distribution, in determining the number of preceding taxable years of the trust with respect to which an amount of the subsequent accumulation distribution is deemed distributed to a beneficiary under section 666(a), there shall be excluded any preceding taxable year during which any part of the prior accumulation distribution was deemed distributed to the beneficiary. For example, assume that an accumulation distribution of $90,000 made to a beneficiary in 1963 is deemed distributed in the amounts of $25,000 in each of the years 1962, 1961, and 1960, and in the amount of $15,000 in 1959, and a subsequent accumulation distribution of $85,000 made to the same beneficiary in 1964 is deemed distributed in the amount of $10,000 during 1959, and $25,000 during each of the years 1958, 1957, and 1956. The accumulation distribution made in 1963 is deemed distributed in 4 preceding taxable years of the trust (1962, 1961, 1960, and 1959). Inasmuch as the year 1959 was a year during which part of the 1963 accumulation distribution was deemed distributed, for purposes of determining the number of preceding taxable years in which the accumulation distribution of $85,000 made in 1964 is deemed distributed, the year 1959 is excluded and the $85,000 accumulation distribution is deemed distributed in three preceding taxable years (1958, 1957, and 1956),

(2) Second, divide the number of preceding taxable years of the trust, on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed (determined as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) into the amount (representing an accumulation distribution made by a foreign trust created by a U.S. person) required to be included under section 669(a) in the gross income of the beneficiary for the taxable year,

(3) Third, compute the tax of the beneficiary for the current taxable year (the year in which the accumulation distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him) and for each of the 2 taxable years immediately preceding such year,

(i) With the inclusion in gross income of the beneficiary for each of such 3 years of the amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and

(ii) Without such inclusion.

(4) Fourth, add the additional taxes resulting from the application of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for the taxable year and the 2 taxable years (or the 1 taxable year, where applicable) immediately preceding the year in which the accumulation distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed and then divide this amount by three (or two, where applicable). The resulting amount is then multiplied by the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed (previously determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph). The resulting amount is the tax, under the short-cut throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(B), which is attributable to the amounts treated under section 668(a) as having been received by the beneficiary from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person on the last day of the preceding taxable year.

(5) Fifth, add the amount determined under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph to the beneficiary's tax for the taxable year in which the accumulation distribution was paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him, computed without inclusion of the accumulation distribution in gross income for that year. The total is the beneficiary's income tax for such year.
