####### Setoff at bottom line.

(v)The setoff of nonlife subgroup losses against consolidated LICTI does not affect life member deductions that depend in whole or in part on taxable income. Thus, the setoff does not affect the amount of consolidated LICTI for any for any taxable year but it merely constitutes an adjustment in arriving at the group's consolidated taxable income under paragraph (e) of this section.
