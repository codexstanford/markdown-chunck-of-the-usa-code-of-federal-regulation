####### Determining the advance payment income inclusion amount in a year prior to the year of sale.

(2)To determine the advance payment income inclusion amount for a taxable year prior to the year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer, the taxpayer must first determine the advance payment inventory inclusion amount for such item for such year. This advance payment inventory inclusion amount is then reduced by the cost of goods in progress offset for the taxable year, as determined under paragraphs (e)(4), (5), and (8) of this section. This net amount is the advance payment income inclusion amount for the taxable year.
