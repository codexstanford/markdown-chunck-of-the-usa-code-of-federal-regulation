() The sum of the balance of the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' extraordinary disposition accounts with respect to the CFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year). However, if the section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate has an RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC, then only the excess, if any, of the balance of the extraordinary disposition account over the balance of the RGI account that relates to the extraordinary disposition account (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year) is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(). In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(), an extraordinary disposition account that but for paragraph (e)(1) of this section would be with respect to the CFC for purposes of this section is treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC and thus is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)().

(ii) The balance of the RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year).
