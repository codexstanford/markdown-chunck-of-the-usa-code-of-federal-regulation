### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### controlled foreign corporations
###### ยง 1.955A-2 Amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations.
####### Excluded charges.

(2)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a liability created principally for the purpose of artificially increasing or decreasing the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations will not be recognized. Whether a liability is created principally for such purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the factors that will be considered in making such a determination with respect to a loan is whether the loan was both created after November 20, 1974, and is from a related person, as defined in section 954(d)(3) and paragraph (e) of ยง 1.954-1. Another such factor is whether the liability was created after March 29, 1975, in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), payments on liabilities which are represented by an open account are credited against the account transactions arising earliest in time.
