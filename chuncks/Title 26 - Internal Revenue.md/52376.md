####### Intercompany gain as eligible gain.

(5)When S sells property to B, ยง 1.1502-13 applies to determine if, and when, S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain constitute eligible gain. S's gain and B's gain are treated as eligible gain only to the extent such gain would be eligible gain if S and B were divisions of a single entity. For example, if S sells a piece of property to B at a gain, B subsequently sells that property to an unrelated party at a further gain, and the gains are treated as capital gain under ยง 1.1502-13(c)(1) and (4), then both S's gain and B's gain are eligible gains at the time B sells the property to the unrelated party. In contrast, if S sells a piece of property to B at a loss, and B subsequently sells that property to an unrelated party at a gain, then B's corresponding gain on the property is eligible gain only to the extent that S and B, if treated as divisions of a single entity, would have eligible gain on the sale of property to the unrelated party. See ยง 1.1502-13(a)(1).
