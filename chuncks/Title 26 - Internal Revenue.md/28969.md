####### Indirectly-held partnership interests that meet the requirements of the de minimis test.

(B)An indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) if the indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of the de minimis test described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section with regard to the organization. For example, if an organization directly holds 50 percent of the capital interests of a partnership and the directly-held partnership holds 4 percent of the capital and profits interest of lower-tier partnership A, the organization may aggregate its interest in lower-tier partnership A with its other QPIs because the organization indirectly holds 2 percent of the capital and profits interests of lower-tier partnership A (4 percent x 50 percent).
