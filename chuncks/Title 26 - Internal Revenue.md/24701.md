() Then subtracting from such amount ($10x per item) the prior income inclusion amounts attributable to each transferred item ($2x per item). This net amount of $8x per item is the AFS income inclusion amount for each transferred item for 2022. Although A does not reduce such amount by a cost of goods in progress offset under this paragraph (c), A is entitled to recover the $4x of costs capitalized to each item delivered as cost of goods sold in 2022 in accordance with sections 471 and 263A. Accordingly, on an aggregate basis, A's gross income for 2022 is $24x (aggregate AFS income inclusion amount for the 6 items delivered in 2022 of $ 48x less aggregate cost of goods sold of $24x). A does not include any amounts in gross income for 2022 with respect to the 4 items of inventory that were not delivered to Customer until 2023 as A does not have an AFS inventory inclusion amount attributable to such items for 2022.
