####### Nonapplication of general rule.

(iii)Contexts in which the general rule of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section does not apply include-

(A) The determination of any aspect of an individual's residency (for example, mirrored section 7701(b)). Thus, for example, an individual whose principal place of abode is in the United States is not considered to have a principal place of abode in the Virgin Islands for purposes of mirrored section 32(c).

(B) The determination of the source of income for purposes other than the foreign tax credit (for example, sections 932(a) and (b), 934(b), and 937). Thus, for example, compensation for services performed in the United States and rentals or royalties from property located in the United States do not constitute income from sources within the Virgin Islands for purposes of section 934(b); and

(C) The definition of wages (mirrored section 3401). Thus, for example, services performed by an employee for an employer in the United States do not constitute services performed in the Virgin Islands under mirrored section 3401(a)(8).
