####### Investment expenses, etc.

(9)(i) The amount of investment expenses to the extent not allowed as a deduction under section 804(c)(1) in computing investment yield. For example, if a deduction in the amount of $100,000 is claimed for investment expenses, which amount includes general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses, and due to the operation of the limitation provided by section 804(c)(1) only $85,000 is allowed, then the excess ($15,000) shall be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9) and this subparagraph.

(ii) The amount (if any) by which the sum of the deductions allowable under section 804(c) exceeds the gross investment income. For example, if gross investment income under section 804(b) equals $400,000, and the sum of the deductions allowable under section 804(c) equals $425,000, then the excess ($25,000) shall be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9) and this subparagraph.

(iii) In determining the amount of the deductions allowed under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, a life insurance company shall first take such deductions to the full extent allowable under section 804(c)(1), and any amount which is allowed as a deduction under section 804(c) shall not again be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9).
