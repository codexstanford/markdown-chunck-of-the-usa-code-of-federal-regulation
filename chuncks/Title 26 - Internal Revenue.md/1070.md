(A)() A single-building housing project received an allocation of housing credit dollar amount for 10 low-income units. The taxpayer who owns the project constructs the building with 10 identically sized units and elects the average income test. In the first year, the taxpayer intended to have 8 units that will qualify as low-income units (within the meaning of ยง 1.42-19(b)(1)), and 2 units that are market-rate units. The taxpayer properly and timely designates the imputed income limitations for the 8 units as follows: 4 units at 80 percent of AMGI; and 4 units at 40 percent of AMGI.
