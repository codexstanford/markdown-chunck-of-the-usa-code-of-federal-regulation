###### ยง 48.4216(a)-1 Charges to be included in sale price.
####### Tools and dies.

(b)Separate charges for tools and dies used in the manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a "production output" basis, should be included in the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a "production output" basis), shall be included in determining the sale price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax. This paragraph applies to sales by manufacturers after May 5, 1974.
