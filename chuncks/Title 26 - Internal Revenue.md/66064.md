######## Changes in firm.

(c)When one or more members of a firm partnership withdraw, the business may be continued by the remaining partner or partners under the same special tax stamp for the remainder of the period for which the stamp was issued to the old firm. The change shall, however, be registered in the same manner as required in paragraph (a) of this section. If new partners are taken into a firm the new firm so constituted may not carry on business under the special tax stamp of the old firm. The new firm shall make a return on Form 11-C and pay the special tax imposed by section 4411 reckoned from the first day of the month in which it began business, even though the name of such firm be the same as that of the old. If the members of a partnership, which has paid the special tax, form a corporation to continue the business a new special tax stamp must be obtained in the name of the corporation.
