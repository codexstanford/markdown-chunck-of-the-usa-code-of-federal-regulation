####### Availability of catch-up contributions.,i.e.,

(4)An applicable employer plan does not violate ยง 1.401(a)(4)-4 merely because the group of employees for whom catch-up contributions are currently available (the catch-up eligible participants) is not a group of employees that would satisfy section 410(b) (without regard to ยง 1.410(b)-5). In addition, a catch-up eligible participant is not treated as having a right to a different rate of allocation of matching contributions merely because an otherwise nondiscriminatory schedule of matching rates is applied to elective deferrals that include catch-up contributions. The rules in this paragraph (d)(4) also apply for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 403(b)(12).
