###### ยง 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### 2

() T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 arose in a SRLY. See ยง 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, the $100 net operating loss carryover is subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 2 equals the consolidated taxable income of the P group determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. However, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, the SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 x 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($300 x 80 percent = $240). Therefore, $56 of the SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 2. Although only $56 is absorbed, the cumulative register of T is reduced by $70, the full amount of income necessary to support the $56 deduction after taking into account the 80-percent limitation ($70 x 80 percent = $56).
