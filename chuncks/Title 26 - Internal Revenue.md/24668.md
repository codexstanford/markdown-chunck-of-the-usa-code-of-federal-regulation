####### Determining gross income for a year prior to the year of sale.

(i)To determine the amount required to be included in gross income from the sale of an item of inventory for a taxable year prior to the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer, a taxpayer must first determine the AFS inventory inclusion amount for such item for such year by applying the steps in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section. This AFS inventory inclusion amount is then reduced by the cost of goods in progress offset for the taxable year, as determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section. This net amount is required to be included in gross income for the taxable year.
