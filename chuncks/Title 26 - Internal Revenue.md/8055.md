##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.163(j)-3 Relationship of the section 163(j) limitation to other provisions affecting interest.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, section 263A is applied before section 163(j). Accordingly, $10x of X's interest expense cannot be taken into consideration for purposes of section 163(j) in 2020. Additionally, under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X's $10 of capitalized interest expense is not business interest expense for purposes of section 163(j). As a result, when X recovers its capitalized interest expense through depreciation deductions, such capitalized interest expense will not be taken into account as business interest expense in determining X's section 163(j) limitation. X's section 163(j) limitation in 2020, or the amount of business interest expense that X may deduct, is limited to $33x under ยง 1.163(j)-2(b), determined by adding X's business interest income ($9x) and 30 percent of X's 2020 ATI ($24x). X therefore has $7x of disallowed business interest expense in 2020 that will be carried forward to 2021 as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward.
