###### ยง 1.1502-95 Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup).
####### Subgroup principles.

(5)If two or more former members are members of the same consolidated group (the second group) immediately after they cease to be members of the current group, the principles of paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (4) of this section apply to those former members on an aggregate basis. Thus, for example, the amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to those members is based on the assets held by those members immediately after they cease to be members of the current group and the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) on recognized built-in losses is applied by taking into account the aggregate amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to the former members and the aggregate recognized losses of those members in taxable years beginning after they cease to be members of the current group. If one or more of such members cease to be members of the second group, the principles of this paragraph (e) are applied with respect to those members to allocate to them all or part of any remaining unrecognized amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to the members that became members of the second group.
