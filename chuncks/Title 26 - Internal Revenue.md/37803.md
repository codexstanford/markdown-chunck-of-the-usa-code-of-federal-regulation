() In determining aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of CFC2 under ยง 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), CFC2 has a single computation with respect to Country F tax, because there is a single foreign payor (CFC2) for Country F tax purposes whose foreign income tax amount, if any, is considered paid or accrued by CFC2 as the section 901(m) payor. Furthermore, for each U.S. taxable year, CFC2 will compute a disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
