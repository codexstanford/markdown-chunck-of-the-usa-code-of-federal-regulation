####### Alternative facts.

(iv)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(21)(iii) of this section, except that P owns DE2and the interest in DE2is combined with and therefore included in the Country X separate unit. In addition, a portion of the dual consolidated loss of the Country X separate unit is attributable to P's interest in DE2. Pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-4(d)(2)(iii)(A), the result would be the same as in paragraph (c)(21)(iii) of this section, with respect to the portion of the dual consolidated loss attributable to the combined separate unit that is succeeded to and taken into account by DC pursuant to section 381. The portion of the dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE2, however, does not carry over to DC but is retained by P and continues to be subject to the limitations of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b) and (c) with respect to P's interest in DE2.
