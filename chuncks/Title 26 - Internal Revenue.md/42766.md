(B) For Federal income tax purposes, Entity A is converted to a partnership when DC2 purchases the 50 percent interest in Entity A. DC2's purchase is treated as the purchase of 50 percent of the assets of Entity A (that is, the assets of Business A), which, prior to the purchase, were treated as held directly by DC1 for Federal income tax purposes. Immediately after DC2's deemed purchase of 50 percent of Business A assets, DC1 and DC2 are treated as contributing their respective interests in Business A assets to a partnership.Rev. Rul. 99-5, 1999-1 CB 434 (situation 1). In connection with the deemed contribution, DC1 and DC2 agree to share equally in all items of the partnership's profits and loss, and, for purposes of ยง 1.987-7, to determine their share of assets and liabilities of the resulting partnership in accordance with their respective shares of partnership profits.
