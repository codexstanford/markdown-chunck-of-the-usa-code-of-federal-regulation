(iv)For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), a youth will not be considered to be "actively pursuing" a school's qualified cooperative education program (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) during summer vacation unless that school program continues during the summer vacation. Whether the school program continues during the summer vacation will be determined by examining the written agreement between the school and the employer. Thus, if a written agreement specifically covers the summer vacation period and provides for a significant degree of involvement by school personnel to provide supervision for the students in the program during that period, the school program will be considered to continue during the summer, regardless of whether classes are held during the vacation period.
