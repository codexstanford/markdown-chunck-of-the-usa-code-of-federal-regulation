###### ยง 1.1038-1 Reacquisitions of real property in satisfaction of indebtedness.
####### Manner of reacquisition.

(ii)For purposes of applying section 1038 and this section there must be a reacquisition by the seller of the real property itself, but the manner in which the seller so reduces the property to ownership or possession, as the case may be, shall generally be immaterial. Thus, the seller may reduce the real property to ownership or possession or both, as the case may require, by agreement or by process of law. The reduction of the real property to ownership or possession by agreement includes, where valid under local law, such methods as voluntary conveyance from the purchaser and abandonment to the seller. The reduction of the real property to ownership or possession by process of law includes foreclosure proceedings in which a competitive bid is entered, such as foreclosure by judicial sale or by power of sale contained in the loan agreement without recourse to the courts, as well as those types of foreclosure proceedings in which a competitive bid is not entered, such as strict foreclosure and foreclosure by entry and possession, by writ of entry, or by publication or notice.
