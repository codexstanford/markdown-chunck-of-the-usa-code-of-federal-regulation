####### Defined benefit plans,In general.

(b)-(1)Except as provided in subparagraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this paragraph, an individual is an active participant in a defined benefit plan if for any portion of the plan year ending with or within such individual's taxable year he is not excluded under the eligibility provisions of the plan. An individual is not an active participant in a particular taxable year merely because the individual meets the plan's eligibility requirements during a plan year beginning in that particular taxable year but ending in a later taxable year of the individual. However, for purposes of this section, an individual is deemed not to satisfy the eligibility provisions for a particular plan year if his compensation is less than the minimum amount of compensation needed under the plan to accrue a benefit. For example, assume a plan is integrated with Social Security and only those individuals whose compensation exceeds a certain amount accrue benefits under the plan. An individual whose compensation for the plan year ending with or within his taxable year is less than the amount necessary under the plan to accrue a benefit is not an active participant in such plan.
