####### Transfer on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.,Example 1

(C)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, except that X's transfer of its assets to Y occurred on December 31, 2022. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2022, X had an additional $350x of disallowed business interest expense (X did not deduct any of its 2021 carryforwards in its 2022 taxable year). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2023, Y had business interest expense of $100x, business interest income of $200x, and ATI of $1,000x. Y's section 163(j) limitation for the 2023 taxable year was $500x ($200x + (30 percent x $1,000x) = $500x). The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X carried under section 381(c)(20) to Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2023, is $750x. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not limit the amount of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that may be deducted by Y in the 2023 taxable year. Since the amount of Y's section 163(j) limit for the 2023 taxable year was $500x, Y may deduct the full amount ($100x) of its own business interest expense for the 2023 taxable year, along with $400x of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.
