###### ยง 31.3406(d)-5 Backup withholding when the Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect.
####### No identification if error is caused by payor.

(iii)A payor may treat an account as not having the incorrect name/TIN combination if the error resulted because the name or taxpayer identification number on such account is not the name or taxpayer identification number that was provided to the payor. This may occur, for example, where a payor transposes numbers in the taxpayer identification number when incorporating it into the payor's business records.
