(iii)For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, assets held by the departing member immediately after it ceases to be a member of the group (or by other members immediately after the close of the taxable year) do not include assets with respect to which gain or loss has previously been recognized and taken into account during the recognition period (including gain or loss recognized in an intercompany transaction and taken into account immediately before the member leaves the group).
