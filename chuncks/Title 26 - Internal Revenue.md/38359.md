###### ยง 1.904-5 Look-through rules as applied to controlled foreign corporations and other entities.
####### Example 4.

(iv)USP, a domestic corporation, owns 50% of the voting stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 owns 10% of the voting stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 50% of the stock of CFC1 is owned by X. The remaining 90% of the stock of CFC2 is owned by Y. X and Y are each United States shareholders of CFC2 but are not related to USP, CFC1, or each other. In Year 1, CFC2 pays a $100x dividend to CFC1. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section because no person is a United States shareholder of both CFC1 and CFC2 (USP and X each own only 5% of CFC2), CFC1 and CFC2 are not related look-through entities. Because CFC2 is not a related person to CFC1 within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), section 954(c)(3) and (c)(6) are inapplicable, and the dividend is subpart F income of CFC1 that is taxable to USP and X. Therefore, under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i) and ยง 1.904-4(b)(2)(i)(A), because the dividend income is foreign personal holding company income, it is passive category income to CFC1.
