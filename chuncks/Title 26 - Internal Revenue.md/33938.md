If an election is made, the shareholders of the regulated investment company shall apply their proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid, or deemed to have been paid by it pursuant to any income tax convention, as either a credit (under section 901) or as a deduction (under section 164(a)) as provided by section 853(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of ยง 1.853-2.
