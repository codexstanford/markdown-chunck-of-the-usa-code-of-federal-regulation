####### Life insurance contract.,life insurance contract

(75)The termmeans an insurance contract under which the issuer, in exchange for consideration, agrees to pay an amount upon the death of one or more individuals. That a contract provides one or more payments (for example, for endowment benefits or disability benefits) in addition to a death benefit will not cause the contract to be other than a life insurance contract. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is immaterial whether a contract satisfies any of the substantive U.S. tax rules (for example, sections 101(f), 817(h), 7702, or investor control prohibition) applicable to the taxation of the contract holder or issuer.
