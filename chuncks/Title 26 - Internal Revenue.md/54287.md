####### Alternative facts.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(11)(i) of this section, except that in year 1 only $150x of income is attributable to P's Country X separate unit. Because only $150x of income is attributed to P's Country X separate unit, $50x of DRC's year 1 dual consolidated loss is treated as being made available to offset the income of FS, a foreign corporation, and therefore constitutes a foreign use. As a result, DRCcannot make a domestic use election with respect to its year 1 dual consolidated loss pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-6(d)(2), and such loss will be subject to the domestic use limitation rule of ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b).
