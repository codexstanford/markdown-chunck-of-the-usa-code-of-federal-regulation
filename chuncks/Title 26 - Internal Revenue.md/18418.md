####### Successive acquiring corporations.

(e)An acquiring corporation which, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as such other corporation for purposes of applying sections 381(c)(13) and 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions). Thus, for example, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer in one transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and any other such factor occurs after the date of distribution or transfer in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation in such subsequent transaction shall be treated as the first distributor or transferor corporation subject to the rules and limitations of this section for purposes of sections 381(c)(13) and 1033.
