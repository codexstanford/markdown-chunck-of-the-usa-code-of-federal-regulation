####### Acquisition by issuer of its own stock.

(4)If a member acquires its own stock, or an option to buy or sell its own stock, in an intercompany transaction, the member's basis in that stock or option is treated as eliminated for all purposes. Accordingly, S's intercompany items from the stock or options of B are taken into account under this section if B acquires the stock or options in an intercompany transaction (unless, for example, B acquires the stock in exchange for successor property within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1) of this section in a nonrecognition transaction). For example, if B redeems its stock from S in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies, S's gain from the transaction is taken into account immediately under the acceleration rule.
