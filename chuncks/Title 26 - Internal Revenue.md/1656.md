###### ยง 1.45Q-5 Recapture of Credit.
####### Recapture event.

(a)A recapture event occurs when qualified carbon oxide for which a section 45Q credit has been previously claimed ceases to be disposed of in secure geological storage (as described in ยง 1.45Q-3(b)), or used as a tertiary injectant during the recapture period. Recapture events are determined separately for each project involving the disposal or use of qualified carbon oxide as a tertiary injectant. A recapture event does not occur if some portion of qualified carbon oxide disposed of in the current year does not remain in secure storage at the end of the year. The amount of such carbon oxide that is securely stored in the current year is determined according to the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart RR or CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019.
