####### Time for identifying a security with a substituted basis.

(b)For purposes of determining the timeliness of an identification under section 475(b)(2), the date that a dealer acquires a security is not affected by whether the dealer's basis in the security is determined, in whole or in part, either by reference to the basis of the security in the hands of the person from whom the security was acquired or by reference to other property held at any time by the dealer. See ยง 1.475(a)-3 for rules governing how the dealer accounts for such a security if this identification is not made.
