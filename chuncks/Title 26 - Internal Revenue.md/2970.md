####### Recomputed income or loss.

(c)For purposes of this section, the phrase "recomputed income or loss" means the taxable income or net operating loss for the taxable year computed without regard to the amounts described in § 1.57-1 except paragraph (i)(2) of that section (relating to corporate capital gains) and without regard to the net operating loss deduction. For this purpose, the reference to the amounts described in § 1.57-1 is a reference to that portion of the deduction allowable in computing taxable income under the appropriate section equal to the amount which is determined in each paragraph of § 1.57-1. For example, the amount described in § 1.57-1(h) (relating to excess of percentage depletion over basis) is that portion of the deduction allowable for depletion under section 611 which is equal to the amount determined under § 1.57-1(h). For purposes of this paragraph, the amount described in § 1.57-1(i)(1) (relating to capital gains) is to be considered as the amount of the deduction allowable for the taxable year under section 1202.
