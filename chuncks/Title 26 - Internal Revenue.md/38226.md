####### 2,Disregarded payment from FDE to P.

()The disregarded payment from FDE to P is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE's $3,400x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under ยง 1.861-8. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward, and the amount of general category foreign source gross income attributable to P (in its capacity as a foreign branch owner) is adjusted upward, to take the disregarded payment into account. Thus, $300x of FDE's foreign source gross income relating to the Customer B services is attributable to P for purposes of this section, and $3,100x of that income is attributable to FDE.
