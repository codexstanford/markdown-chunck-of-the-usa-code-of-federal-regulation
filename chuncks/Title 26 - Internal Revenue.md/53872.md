###### ยง 1.1502-95 Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup).
####### Effect of a prior ownership change of the group.

(2)If a loss group has had an ownership change under ยง 1.1502-92 before a corporation ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (the former member)-

(i) Any pre-change consolidated attribute that is subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation continues to be treated as a pre-change loss with respect to the former member after it is apportioned to the former member and, if any net unrealized built-in loss is allocated to the former member under paragraph (e) of this section, any recognized built-in loss of the former member is a pre-change loss of the member;

(ii) The section 382 limitation with respect to such pre-change attribute is zero unless the common parent, under paragraph (c) of this section, apportions to the former member all or part of the consolidated section 382 limitation applicable to such attribute. The limitation applicable to a pre-change attribute other than a recognized built-in loss may be increased to the extent that the common parent has apportioned all or part of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain to the former member, and the former member recognizes built-in gain during the recognition period;

(iii) The testing period for determining a subsequent ownership change with respect to such pre-change attribute (or such net unrealized built-in loss, if any) begins no earlier than the first day following the loss group's most recent change date; and

(iv) As generally provided under section 382, an ownership change of the former member that occurs on or after the day it ceases to be a member of a loss group may result in an additional, lesser limitation amount with respect to such losses.
