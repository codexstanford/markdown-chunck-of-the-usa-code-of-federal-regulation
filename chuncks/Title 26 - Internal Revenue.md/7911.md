####### Interest income artificially increased.

(B)Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(22)(i) through (iii) of this section, any income realized by a taxpayer in a transaction or series of integrated or related transactions is not treated as interest income of the taxpayer if and to the extent that a principal purpose for structuring the transaction(s) is to artificially increase the taxpayer's business interest income. For this purpose, the fact that the taxpayer has a business purpose for holding interest generating assets does not affect the determination of whether the manner in which the taxpayer structures the transaction(s) is with a principal purpose of artificially increasing the taxpayer's business interest income.
