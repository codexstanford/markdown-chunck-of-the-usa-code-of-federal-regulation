###### ยง 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### Foreign tax redeterminations of successors or transferees.

(3)If at the time of a foreign tax redetermination the person with legal liability for the tax (or in the case of a refund, the legal right to such refund) (the "successor") is a different person than the person that had legal liability for the tax in the year to which the redetermined tax relates (the "original taxpayer"), the required redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made as if the foreign tax redetermination occurred in the hands of the original taxpayer. Federal income tax principles apply to determine the tax consequences if the successor remits (or receives a refund of) a tax that in the year to which the redetermined tax relates was the legal liability of, and thus under ยง 1.901-2(f) is considered paid by, the original taxpayer.
