The expenditures need not be capitalized in fact; it is sufficient if the taxpayer has an option or may elect to capitalize. In general, the date of change will be the date the expenditures are properly chargeable to capital account. If the taxpayer properly elects to expense a capitalizable expenditure, the date of change will be the date the expenditure could have been properly chargeable to capital account if the expenditure had been capitalized. Recapture will not occur by reason of a change in a process unless the process change also changes the use of the equipment. See example (1) of ยง 1.47-1(h)(5).
