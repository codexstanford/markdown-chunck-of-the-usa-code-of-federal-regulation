######## Corrective action.

(c)For purposes of this section, corrective action means taking the steps required to file the election in accordance with the statute or the regulation published in theor the revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see ยง 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). For those elections required to be filed with a return, corrective action includes filing an original or an amended return for the year the regulatory or statutory election should have been made and attaching the appropriate form or statement for making the election. Taxpayers who make an election under an automatic extension (and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election) must file their return in a manner that is consistent with the election and comply with all other requirements for making the election for the year the election should have been made and for all affected years; otherwise, the IRS may invalidate the election.
