###### ยง 1.460-6 Look-back method.
####### Exceptions from section 460.

(2)The look-back method generally does not apply to the regular taxable income from any long-term construction contract within the meaning of section 460(e)(3) that:

(i) Is a home construction contract within the meaning of section 460(e)(1)(A), or

(ii) Is not a home construction contract but is estimated to be completed within a 2-year period by a taxpayer, other than a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting under section 448(a)(3), who meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and ยง 1.460-3(b)(3) for the taxable year in which such contract is entered into. These contracts are not subject to the look-back method for regular tax purposes, even if the taxpayer uses a version of the percentage of completion method permitted under ยง 1.451-3, unless the taxpayer has properly changed its method of accounting for these contracts to the percentage of completion method as modified by section 460(b). The look-back method, however, applies to the alternative minimum taxable income from a contract of this type, for those taxpayers subject to the AMT in taxable years prior to the filing taxable year in which the look-back method is required, unless the contract is exempt from required use of the percentage of completion method under section 56(a)(3).
