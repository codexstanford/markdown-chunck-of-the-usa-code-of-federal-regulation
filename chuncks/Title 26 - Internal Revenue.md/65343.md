####### Optional rule.

(c)The payor and the employer may at their option enter into an agency agreement valid under local law whereby the employer designates the payor to be the employer's agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section. This agreement must specify what portion, if any, of the sick pay is excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3). If they enter into such an agreement, the payor shall not provide the statement required by paragraph (a) but shall instead furnish statements that meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b), except that the agreement must provide that the payor will furnish the statements with the payor's, rather than the employer's name, address, and Employer Identification Number (EIN) if "Sick Pay Statement Furnished under an Agency Agreement with Your Employer" appears in the box labelled "Employer's Use" on Form W-2. Paragraph (a)(2) remains applicable to statements furnished under this paragraph. In the case of sick pay paid under a multiemployer plan pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement, an amendment to either the multiemployer plan or the collectively bargained agreement designating the payor to be the employers' agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section shall be deemed an agency agreement that fulfills the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph.
