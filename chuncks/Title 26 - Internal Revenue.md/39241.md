No. Where the principal shareholder is not a calendar year taxpayer, a corporation may elect to be treated as a FFSC, small FSC, or interest charge DISC for a taxable year beginning January 1, 1985. However, such corporation must close its first taxable year and adopt the annual accounting period of its principal shareholder as of the first day of the principal shareholder's first taxable year beginning in 1985. A FSC, small FSC, or interest charge DISC need not obtain the consent of the Commissioner under section 442 to conform its annual accounting period to the annual accounting period of its principal shareholder.
