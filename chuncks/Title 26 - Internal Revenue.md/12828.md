####### Anti-duplication rule.,1,ii

(B)For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter such disqualified basis gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder. Thus, for example, if the entire amount of disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount for a particular taxable year of a CFC and is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder but, pursuant to ยง 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)()(), the disqualified basis is not reduced or eliminated in such taxable year of the CFC (because, for example, the buyer is a CFC that is a related party) and, as a result, the disqualified basis thereafter gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, then no portion of the additional basis benefit amount is assigned to a taxable year of any section 245A shareholder.
