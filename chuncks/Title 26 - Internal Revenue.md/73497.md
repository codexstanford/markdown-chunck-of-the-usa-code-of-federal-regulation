(5)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (e)(4) of this section, except that PR does not request an extension of the period for requesting modification. On February 1, 2026, PR submits a request for modification and PR, and the IRS agree in writing to waive the prohibition on mailing an FPA pursuant to ยง 301.6231-1(b)(2). Pursuant to ยง 301.6225-2(c)(3)(iii), the period for requesting modification expires as of February 1, 2026, rather than February 27, 2026. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the date on which everything required to be submitted pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted is February 1, 2026, and the 270-day period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to run on that date. Therefore, the date for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is October 29, 2026, which is 270 days after February 1, 2026, the date on which everything required to be submitted under section 6225(c) is so submitted. Because October 29, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (April 28, 2026), October 29, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
