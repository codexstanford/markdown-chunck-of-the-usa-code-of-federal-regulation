####### Present value.

(4)The present value of a benefit (including a portion of a benefit) with respect to a participant that is taken into account under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section is determined as of the valuation date by multiplying the amount of that benefit by the probability that the benefit will be paid at a future date and then discounting the resulting product using the appropriate interest rate under ยง 1.430(h)(2)-1. The probability that the benefit will be paid with respect to the participant at such future date is determined using the actuarial assumptions that satisfy the standards of paragraph (f) of this section as to the probability of future service, advancement in age, and other events (such as death, disability, termination of employment, and selection of optional form of benefit) that affect whether the participant or beneficiary will be eligible for the benefit and whether the benefit will be paid at that future date.
