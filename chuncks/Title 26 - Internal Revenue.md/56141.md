###### ยง 1.6042-2 Returns of information as to dividends paid.
####### Determination of person to whom a dividend is paid or for whom it is received.

(3)For purposes of applying the provisions of this section, the person whose identifying number is required to be included by the payer of a dividend on an information return with respect to such dividend shall be considered the person to whom the dividend is paid. In the case of a dividend received by a nominee on behalf of another person, the person whose identifying number is required to be included on an information return made by the nominee with respect to such dividend shall be considered the person on whose behalf such dividend is received by the nominee. Thus, in the case of a dividend made payable to a person other than the record owner of the stock with respect to which the dividend is paid, the record owner of the stock shall be considered the person to whom the dividend is paid for purposes of applying the reporting requirements in this section, since his identifying number is required to be included on the information return filed under this section by the payer of the dividend. Similarly, if a stockbroker receives a dividend on stock held in street name for the joint account of a husband and wife, the dividend is considered as received on behalf of the husband since his identifying number should be shown on the information return filed by the nominee under this section. Thus, if the wife has a separate account with the same stockbroker, any dividends received by the stockbroker for her separate account should not be aggregated with the dividends received for the joint account for purposes of information reporting. For regulations relating to the use of identifying numbers, see ยง 1.6109-1.
