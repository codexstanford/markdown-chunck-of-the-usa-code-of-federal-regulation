(d)The principles of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples and except as otherwise provided, IC is a life insurance company within the meaning of section 816(a) that issues life insurance and annuity contracts. IC is required to determine the amount of life insurance reserves under section 807(d) and to take net increases or decreases in the reserves into account in computing life insurance company taxable income. IC's reserve for each insurance contract at issue exceeds the net surrender value for such contract and does not exceed the statutory reserve for such contract. IC is on an accrual method and uses a calendar year as its taxable year.
