####### Agency.

(iii)A Swiss enterprise which has an agency in the United States does not thereby have a permanent establishment in the United States, unless the agent has, and habitually exercises, a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of such enterprise or unless he has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders on its behalf. If the enterprise has an agent in the United States who has power to contract on its behalf, but only at fixed prices and under conditions determined by such principal, it does not thereby necessarily have a permanent establishment in the United States. The mere fact that an agent of a Swiss enterprise-assuming he has no general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of his principal-maintains samples, or occasionally fills orders from incidental stocks of goods maintained, in the United States does not of itself mean that such enterprise has a permanent establishment in the United States. The mere fact that salesmen, employees of a Swiss enterprise, promote the sale of their employer's products in the United States or that a Swiss enterprise transacts business in the United States by means of mail order activities does not mean that such enterprise has a permanent establishment in the United States. A Swiss enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the United States merely because it carries on business dealings in the United States through a commission agent, broker, custodian, or other independent agent, acting in the ordinary course of his business as such.
