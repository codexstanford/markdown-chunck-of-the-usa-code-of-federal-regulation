######## Partnerships that have an election under section 6221(b) in effect.

(iii)In the case of a partnership-partner that has an election under section 6221(b) in effect for the reviewed year (as defined in ยง 301.6241-1(a)(8)), any tax resulting from an adjustment due to the partnership-partner's failure to comply with section 6222(a) may be assessed with respect to the reviewed year partners (as defined in ยง 301.6241-1(a)(9)) of the partnership-partner (or indirect partners of the partnership-partner, as defined in ยง 301.6241-1(a)(4)). Such tax may be assessed in the same manner as if the tax were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the reviewed year partner's or indirect partner's return, except that the procedures under section 6213(b)(2) for requesting an abatement of such assessment do not apply.
