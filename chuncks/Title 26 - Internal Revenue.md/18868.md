###### § 1.382-8 Controlled groups.
####### Coordination between consolidated groups and controlled groups.,Example 4

(f)Some or all of the component members of a controlled group may also be members of a consolidated group, and a controlled group loss may be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation determined under § 1.1502-93. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f) and §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99, § 1.1502-93 applies instead of this section when both sections, by their terms, are otherwise applicable. This section is applicable and may require an adjustment to value if a member of a consolidated group, a loss group, or loss subgroup (as those terms are defined in §§ 1.1502-1(h) and 1.1502-91) is also a component member of a controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss. Solely for purposes of applying this section, a consolidated group, loss group, or loss subgroup is treated as a single corporation. Thus to determine the limitation with respect to any portion of the pre-change consolidated attributes or pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss group or loss subgroup that is a controlled group loss, the consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation is computed by treating the loss group or the loss subgroup as a single corporation, and adjusting value in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (g)of this section.
