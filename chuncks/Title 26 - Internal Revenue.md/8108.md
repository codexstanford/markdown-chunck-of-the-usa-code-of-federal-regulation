####### Analysis.

(B)As provided in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, the intercompany obligation between P and S is disregarded in determining P and S's business interest expense and business interest income and in determining the P group's ATI. For purposes of section 163(j), P has $10x of business interest expense and a $30x deduction for the payment of tort liability claims, and S has $40x of income. The P group's ATI is $10x ($40x-$30x = $10x), and its section 163(j) limitation is $3x (30 percent x $10x = $3x). The P group may deduct $3x of its business interest expense in the 2021 taxable year. A deduction for P's remaining $7x of business interest expense is disallowed in the 2021 taxable year, and this amount is carried forward to the 2022 taxable year.
