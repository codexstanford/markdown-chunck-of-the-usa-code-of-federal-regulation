####### Reasoned written opinion.

(iii)For purposes of this subparagraph (2), a written opinion means an opinion, in writing, rendered by a tax advisor (including house counsel) whose opinion would be relied on by a person exercising ordinary business care and prudence in the circumstances of the particular transaction. A written opinion is considered "reasoned" even if it reaches a conclusion which is subsequently determined to be incorrect, so long as the opinion is based on a full disclosure of the factual situation by the real estate investment trust and is addressed to the facts and law which the person rendering the opinion believes to be applicable. However, an opinion is not considered "reasoned" if it does nothing more than recite the facts and express a conclusion.
