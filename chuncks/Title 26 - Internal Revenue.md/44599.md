####### GP Capital Interest Allocation Analysis.

(C)GP is allocated $2,160 from PRS, consisting of a $2,000 API allocation and a $160 Capital Interest Allocation. The $160 Capital Interest Allocation is allocated equally to A, B, and C based on their capital contributions to GP. Therefore, they qualify as Capital Interest Allocations by GP. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The $2,000 of gain allocated by PRS's to GP with respect to GP's API cannot be treated as a Capital Interest Allocation by GP and therefore is subject to section 1061. In summary, A, B, and C are each allocated $720 of capital gain from PRS ($2,160/3). Of this amount, $667 is API Gain ($2,000/3) and $53 is a Capital Interest Allocation ($160/3).
