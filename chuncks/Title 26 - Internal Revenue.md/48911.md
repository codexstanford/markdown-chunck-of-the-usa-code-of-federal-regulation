####### Analysis.

(B)Based on these facts, the partnership is formed and availed of with a significant purpose to avoid the requirements of ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B). Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the partnership is disregarded for purposes of applying ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(ix)(B) to the $50 gain, and therefore the partnership's investment in the QOF is not a qualifying investment.
