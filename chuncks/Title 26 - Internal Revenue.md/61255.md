## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 4 - TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS UNDER SECTION 954 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
##### ยง 4.954-2 Foreign personal holding company income; taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
###### Exclusion of rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.

(5)Foreign personal holding company income shall not include rents or royalties which are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and which are received from a person other than a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3). Whether or not rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case; but see paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for specific cases in which rents or royalties will be considered for purposes of this paragraph to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. The frequency with which a foreign corporation enters into transactions from which rents or royalties are derived will not of itself establish the fact that such rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.
