###### ยง 1.857-3 Net income from foreclosure property.
####### Directly connected deductions.

(b)A deduction which is otherwise allowed by chapter 1 of the Code is "directly connected" with the production of gross income from the foreclosure property if it has a proximate and primary relationship to the earning of the income. Thus, in the case of gross income from real property that is foreclosure property, "directly connected" deductions would include depreciation on the property, interest paid or accrued on the indebtedness of the trust (whether or not secured by the property) to the extent attributable to the carrying of the property, real estate taxes, and fees paid to an independent contractor hired to manage the property. On the other hand, general overhead and administrative expenses of the trust are not "directly connected" deductions. Thus, salaries of officers and other administrative employees of the trust are not "directly connected" deductions. The net operating loss deduction provided by section 172 is not allowed in computing net income from foreclosure property.
