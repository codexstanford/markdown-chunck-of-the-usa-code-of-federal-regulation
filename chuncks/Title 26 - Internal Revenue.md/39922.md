####### Tax home test,General rule.

(d)-(1)Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a tax home outside the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual's tax home is determined under the principles of section 911(d)(3) without regard to the second sentence thereof. Thus, under section 937, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense.
