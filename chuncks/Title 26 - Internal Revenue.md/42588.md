###### ยง 1.987-2 Attribution of items to eligible QBUs; definition of a transfer and related rules.
####### Assets and liabilities of a section 987 aggregate partnership or DE that are not attributed to an eligible QBU.

(4)Neither a section 987 aggregate partnership nor a DE is an eligible QBU and, thus, neither entity can be a section 987 QBU. See ยง 1.987-1(b)(2) and (3). As a result, a section 987 aggregate partnership or DE may own assets and liabilities that are not attributed to an eligible QBU as provided under this paragraph (b) and, therefore, are not subject to section 987. For the foreign currency treatment of such assets or liabilities, see ยง 1.988-1(a)(4).
