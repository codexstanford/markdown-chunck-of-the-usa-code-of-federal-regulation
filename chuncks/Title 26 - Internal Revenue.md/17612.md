####### Result.

(B)The year 3 transfer of the TFC stock by UST to DC constitutes a triggering event under paragraph (j)(4) of this section. However, the transfer shall not constitute a triggering event pursuant to paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section if DC enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer that designates DC as the U.S. transferor for purposes of this section. Pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, if DC is required to recognize gain under the new gain recognition agreement, the basis of the stock of TFC and TFD would be increased by the amount of gain recognized. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, no adjustment would be made to the basis of the DC voting stock received by UST in year 3 as a result of such gain recognition. Alternatively, if the conditions for the application of paragraph (k)(14) of this section are satisfied UST could instead enter into the new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer.
