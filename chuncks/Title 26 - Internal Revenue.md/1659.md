####### Qualified carbon oxide subject to recapture.

(d)The quantity of recaptured qualified carbon oxide (in metric tons) subject to recapture is the amount by which the leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide exceeds the amount of qualified carbon oxide securely stored in the taxable year. The leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide shall be subtracted from the amount of qualified carbon oxide that is securely stored in the taxable year. If the leaked amount does not exceed the amount of qualified carbon oxide that is securely stored in the taxable year, then the taxpayer is entitled to a credit equal to the amount of qualified carbon oxide securely stored less the leaked amount in the taxable year, multiplied by the appropriate statutory credit rate.
