####### Special rules as to estates and trusts.

(4)In the case of an estate or trust, computations of amounts under this paragraph shall be made without regard to any deductions under section 651 or 661. If on the termination of an estate or trust the beneficiaries succeeding to its property are allowed a deduction under section 642(h) (relating to unused loss carryovers and excess deductions on termination available to beneficiaries), to the extent the carryover or excess deduction is attributable to a farm loss it shall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust. The amount of a carryover or of excess deductions from a particular taxable year of an estate or trust succeeded to under section 642(h) shall be allocated between amounts attributable to a farm net loss and other amounts in the same proportion as the farm net loss for such year bears to the amount of such carryover or of excess deductions. If there is more than one beneficiary, the total farm net loss succeeded to by all the beneficiaries shall be allocated to each beneficiary in proportion to the deduction of each under section 642(h).
