####### Method of reporting gross premiums written,In general.

(5)-(i)Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph (a)(5), an insurance company reports gross premiums written for the earlier of the taxable year that includes the effective date of the insurance contract or the year in which the company receives all or a portion of the gross premium for the insurance contract. The effective date of the insurance contract is the date on which the insurance coverage provided by the contract commences. The effective period of an insurance contract is the period over which one or more rates for insurance coverage are guaranteed in the contract. If a new rate for insurance coverage is guaranteed after the effective date of an insurance contract, the making of such a guarantee generally is treated as the issuance of a new insurance contract with an effective period equal to the duration of the new guaranteed rate for insurance coverage.
