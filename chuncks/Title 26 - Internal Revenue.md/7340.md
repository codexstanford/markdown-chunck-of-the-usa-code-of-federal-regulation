# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### § 1.162-33 Certain employee remuneration in excess of $1,000,000 not deductible for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
####### Conclusion.

(B)If this section applies, Employee A is a covered employee for Corporation X's 2021 taxable year. Employee A's NQDC plan is not a material modification of the written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, because the earnings to be paid under the NQDC plan are based on a predetermined actual investment (as defined in § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(B) of this chapter). The deduction for the $50,000 of earnings to be paid that exceed the amount originally payable to Employee A under the written binding contract ($200,000 of salary) are subject to this section (and not § 1.162-27). This section does not apply (and § 1.162-27 does apply) to the deduction for the $200,000 portion of the $250,000 payment that Corporation X was obligated under applicable law to pay as of November 2, 2017. Pursuant to § 1.162-27(c)(2), Employee A is not a covered employee for Corporation X's 2021 taxable year; thus, the deduction for the $200,000 payment is not subject to section 162(m)(1).
