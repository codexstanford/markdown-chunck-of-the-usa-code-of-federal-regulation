####### Section 1250 property.

(2)With respect to that part of the basis of section 1250 property acquired after July 24, 1969, which in the hands of the acquiring corporation exceeds the adjusted basis to the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall be subject to the limitations contained in section 167(j)(4) (relating to used section 1250 property) or 167(j)(5) (relating to used residential rental property). Thus, for example, if section 1250 property which is not residential rental property is acquired in a section 381(a) transaction after July 24, 1969, the straight line method of depreciation (or other method allowable under section 167(j)(4)(B)) is the only acceptable method with respect to that portion of the basis of the property which, in the hands of the acquiring corporation, exceeds the adjusted basis to the transferor or distributor corporation.
