###### § 1.861-9 Allocation and apportionment of interest expense and rules for asset-based apportionment.
####### Anti-avoidance rule for loans held by CFCs.

(iv)A loan receivable held by a controlled foreign corporation with respect to a loan to a partnership in which a United States shareholder (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(vi)) of the controlled foreign corporation owns an interest, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships or other pass-through entities (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(iv)), is recharacterized as a loan receivable held directly by the United States shareholder with respect to the loan to such partnership for purposes of this paragraph (e)(8) if the loan was made or transferred with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8). An appropriate amount of income derived by the United States shareholder (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the United States shareholder) from the controlled foreign corporation is treated as DPL interest income. Appropriate adjustments must be made to the value and characterization of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation under §§ 1.861-9 and 1.861-12 in order to reflect the portion of the downstream partnership loan held by the controlled foreign corporation that is disregarded under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.
