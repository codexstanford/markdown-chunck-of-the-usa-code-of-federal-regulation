###### ยง 1.856-6 Foreclosure property.
####### Failure to complete construction.

(7)Property will not cease to be foreclosure property solely because a trust which undertakes the completion of construction of a building or other improvement on the property that was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent does not complete the construction. Thus, for example, if a trust continues construction of a building that was 20 percent complete when default became imminent, and the trust constructs an additional 40 percent of the building and then sells the property, the property will not lose its status as foreclosure property solely because the trust fails to complete construction of the building.
