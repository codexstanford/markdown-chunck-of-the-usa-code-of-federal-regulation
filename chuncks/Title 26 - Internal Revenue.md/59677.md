##### ยง 1.401(m)-2 ACP test.
###### Timing of allocation.

(i)The qualified nonelective contribution is allocated to the employee's account as of a date within that year (within the meaning of ยง 1.401(k)-2(a)(4)(i)(A)) and the elective contribution satisfies ยง 1.401(k)-2(a)(4)(i). Consequently, under the prior year testing method, in order to be taken into account in calculating the ACP for the group of eligible NHCEs for the applicable year, a qualified nonelective contribution must be contributed no later than the end of the 12-month period following the applicable year even though the applicable year is different than the plan year being tested.
