####### Treatment of section 467 loan.

(2)If, as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a lessee assigns its interest in a section 467 rental agreement to a substitute lessee or a period when a substitute lessee has the use of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is otherwise included in the lease term under ยง 1.467-1(h)(6), the following rules apply in determining the amount of the lessee's and the substitute lessee's section 467 loans for the period when the substitute lessee has use of the property and in computing the taxable income of the lessee and substitute lessee:

(i) The beginning balance of the lessee's section 467 loan is equal to the net present value, as of the time the substitute lessee first has use of the property (but after giving effect to the transfer of the right to use the property), of all amounts subsequently payable by the lessee as fixed rent and interest on fixed rent and all amounts subsequently payable as interest on prepaid fixed rent to the lessee. For purposes of this paragraph (f), any amount otherwise payable by the lessee is not treated as an amount subsequently payable by the lessee to the extent that such payment, if made by the lessee, would give rise to a right of contribution or other similar claim against the substitute lessee or any other person.

Amounts payable by the lessee to any person other than the substitute lessee (or a related person) or payable to the lessee by any person other than the substitute lessee (or a related person) are not taken into account in adjusting the substitute lessee's section 467 loan balance.

(iii) If the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan is positive, the beginning balance is treated as-

(A) Gross receipts of the lessee for the taxable year in which the substitute lessee first has use of the property; and

(B) A liability that is either assumed in connection with the transfer of the leasehold interest to the substitute lessee or secured by property acquired subject to the liability.

(iv) If the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan is negative, the following rules apply:

(A) If the principal balance of the lessee's section 467 loan immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property was negative, any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property shall be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the lessee to the extent that-
