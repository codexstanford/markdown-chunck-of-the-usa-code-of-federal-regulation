()For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)() and () of this section, the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to any particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, is prorated between the residual income pool and the nonlife income pool based on the relative amounts of positive income of those two pools. For example, if $30 of pre-2018 NOLs is carried over to a consolidated return year in which the residual income pool contains $75 and the nonlife income pool contains $150, the residual income pool is allocated $10 of the pre-2018 NOLs ($30 x $75/($75 + $150), or $30 x), and the nonlife income pool is allocated the remaining $20 of pre-2018 NOLs ($30 x $150/($75 + $150), or $30 x).
