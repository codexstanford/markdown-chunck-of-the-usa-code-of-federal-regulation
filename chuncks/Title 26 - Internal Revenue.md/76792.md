####### ยง 301.9100-18T Election to include in gross income in year of transfer.
######## In general.

(a)Under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 any person who performs services in connection with which property is transferred which at the time of transfer is not transferable by the transferee and is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture may elect to include in his gross income for the taxable year in which such property is transferred, the excess of the fair market value of such property at the time of transfer (determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse) over the amount (if any) paid for such property. If this election is made section 33(a) does not apply with respect to such property, and any subsequent appreciation in the value of the property is not taxable as compensation. However, if the property is later forfeited, no deduction is allowed to any person with respect to such forfeiture. This election is not necessary in the case of property which is transferred subject only to a restriction which by its terms will never lapse.
