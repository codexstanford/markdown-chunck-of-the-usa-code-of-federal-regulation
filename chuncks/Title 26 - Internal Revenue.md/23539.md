####### Allocation of contribution to a plan year,Plans with unpaid minimum required contributions that have not been corrected.

(3)-(i)If a plan has unpaid minimum required contributions within the meaning of ยง 54.4971(c)-1(c) of this chapter that have not yet been corrected within the meaning of ยง 54.4971(c)-1(d)(2) of this chapter at the time a contribution is made, then the contribution is treated as a late contribution for the earliest plan year for which there is an unpaid minimum required contribution (to the extent necessary to correct that unpaid minimum required contribution). To the extent the contribution exceeds the amount necessary to correct the earlier unpaid minimum required contribution, the excess is treated as a late contribution for the next earliest plan year for which there is an unpaid minimum required contribution (to the extent necessary to correct that next earliest unpaid minimum required contribution). The allocation of the contribution under the preceding sentence is repeated until all unpaid minimum required contributions have been corrected, or until the entire contribution is allocated, whichever comes first.
