###### ยง 1.168(k)-2 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Section 168(i)(7) transactions.

(iii)If any qualified property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the qualified property. If a partnership interest is purchased and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any section 743(b) adjustment that arises from the initial acquisition with respect to qualified property held by the partnership, provided the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section are satisfied. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property for the transferor's taxable year in which the property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for a section 743(b) adjustment with respect to qualified property held by the partnership is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis notwithstanding that under ยง 1.743-1(f) a transferee's section 743(b) adjustment is determined without regard to a transferors section 743(b) adjustment. These allocations shall be made in accordance with the rules in ยง 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. However, solely for purposes of this section, if the qualified property is transferred in a section 721(a) transaction to a partnership that has as a partner a person, other than the transferor, who previously had a depreciable interest in the qualified property, in the same taxable year that the qualified property is acquired or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the qualified property is deemed to be placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor during that taxable year, and the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction is allocated entirely to the transferor and not to the partnership. Additionally, if qualified property is both placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) by the transferor during the same taxable year, and if such property is disposed of by the transferee, other than by a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), during the same taxable year the transferee received such property from the transferor, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either party.
