(c)-(1)Upon a transfer of property described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of gain treated as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1254(a)(1) may not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1254). In the case of a transfer of both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the natural resource recapture property is deemed to be equal to the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount realized as the fair market value of the natural resource recapture property bears to the aggregate fair market value of all the property transferred. The preceding sentence is applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1254) that may be recognized as ordinary income under section 1254(a)(1).
