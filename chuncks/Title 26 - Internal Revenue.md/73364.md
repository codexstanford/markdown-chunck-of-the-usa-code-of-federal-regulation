####### ยง 301.6231(a)(7)-1 Designation or selection of tax matters partner.
######## Limited opportunity for partnership to designate the tax matters partner.

(2)(i) Before the Commissioner selects a tax matters partner under paragraphs (p) (1) and (3)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will notify the partnership by mail that, after 30 days from the date of the notice, the Commissioner will make a determination that it is impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section and will select the tax matters partner unless a prior designation is made by the partnership. This delay in making the determination will permit the partnership to designate a tax matters partner under paragraph (e) of this section (designation by general partners with a majority interest) or paragraph (f) of this section (designation by partners with a majority interest under certain circumstances), thereby avoiding a selection made by the Commissioner.

(ii) During the 30-day period and prior to a tax-matters-partner designation by the partnership, the Commissioner will communicate with the partnership by sending all correspondence or notices to "The Tax Matters Partner" in care of the partnership at the partnership's address.

(iii) Any subsequent designation of a tax matters partner by the partnership after the 30-day period will become effective as provided under paragraph (k)(2) of this section (concerning designations made after a notice of beginning of administrative proceeding is mailed).
