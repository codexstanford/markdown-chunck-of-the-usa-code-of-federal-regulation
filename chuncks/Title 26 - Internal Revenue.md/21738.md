####### Application of section 411(a) nonforfeitability provisions with respect to section 411(d)(6) protected benefits,In general.

(3)-(i)The rules of this paragraph (a) apply to a plan amendment that decreases a participant's accrued benefits, or otherwise places greater restrictions or conditions on a participant's rights to section 411(d)(6) protected benefits, even if the amendment merely adds a restriction or condition that is permitted under the vesting rules in section 411(a)(3) through (11). However, such an amendment does not violate section 411(d)(6) to the extent it applies with respect to benefits that accrue after the applicable amendment date. See section 411(a)(10) and ยง 1.411(a)-8 for additional rules relating to changes in a plan's vesting schedule.
