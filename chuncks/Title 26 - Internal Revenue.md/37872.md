(2)-(i)The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (i)(A) of) but the facts in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section (paragraph (i)(B) of) are instead that on July 1, Year 2, Asset A is transferred to CFC2, in exchange for 100u of stock of CFC2 (subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1 does not recognize any U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss with respect to Asset A. For Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes foreign disposition gain of 60u (amount realized of 100u, less foreign basis of 40u) with respect to Asset A. Immediately after the subsequent transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis less 30u accumulated depreciation) and a foreign basis of 100u. The 30u of accumulated depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost basis/5 years) and 10u in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5 years) x 6/12).
