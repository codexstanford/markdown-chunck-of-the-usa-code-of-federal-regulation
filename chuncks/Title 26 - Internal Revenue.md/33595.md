####### Adjustment for refunds.

(c)Section 826(g) provides that if for any taxable year an attorney-in-fact is allowed a credit or refund for taxes paid with respect to which credit or refund to the reciprocal resulted under section 826(e), the taxes of such reciprocal for such taxable year shall be properly adjusted. The reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by increasing its income tax liability for its taxable year in which the credit or refund is allowed to the attorney-in-fact by the amount of such credit or refund which is attributable to taxes paid by the attorney-in-fact on income received from the reciprocal, as determined under ยง 1.826-6, but only to the extent that the payment of such amount by the attorney-in-fact resulted in a credit or refund to the reciprocal. However, if the refund or credit to the attorney-in-fact is the result of an error in determining its items of income or deduction for the taxable year with respect to which the refund or credit is allowed, and such error affects the amount of deductions allocable to its reciprocal for such taxable year, then, if the reciprocal's period for filing an amended return has not otherwise expired, the preceding sentence shall not apply and the reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by filing an amended return for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years for which an adjustment is required. The reciprocal's amended return or returns shall give effect to the change in the deductions of the attorney-in-fact allocable to income received from the reciprocal and the tax paid by the attorney-in-fact attributable to such income. The amount of any adjustment required by section 826(g) and this section and the computation thereof shall be set forth in a statement attached to and filed with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which the adjustment is made. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, and a copy of the notification received by the attorney-in-fact indicating that it has been allowed the credit or refund requiring adjustment of the reciprocal's taxes.
