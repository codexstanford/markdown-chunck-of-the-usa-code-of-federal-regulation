####### § 301.6226-3 Adjustments taken into account by partners.
######## Computation of the imputed underpayment.

(iii)The imputed underpayment under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section is computed in the same manner as an imputed underpayment under section 6225 and § 301.6225-1, except that adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner under § 301.6226-2 are treated as partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) for the first affected year. Any modification approved by the IRS under § 301.6225-2 with respect to the pass-through partner (including any modifications with respect to a relevant partner (as defined in § 301.6225-2(a)) that holds its interest in the audited partnership through its interest in the pass-through partner) reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner under § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is taken into account in calculating the imputed underpayment under this paragraph (e)(4)(iii). Any modification that was not approved by the IRS under § 301.6225-2 may not be taken into account in calculating the imputed underpayment under this paragraph (e)(4)(iii).
