()-()On January 1, 2019, QOF A purchases the assets of a hotel business located in a qualified opportunity zone for $5 million. The purchased assets include land, a building, linens, furniture and other fixtures attached to the building. $1 million of the purchase price is allocated to land and the remaining $4 million is allocated to the building, furniture and fixtures. During the course of renovations over the 30-month substantial improvement period, the QOF spent $1 million replacing linens, mattresses and furniture, $500,000 on the purchase of new exercise equipment for a gym located in the hotel building, $1 million on renovations for a restaurant (including restaurant equipment) attached to the hotel, and $1.5 million on structural renovations to the hotel. The QOF chooses to apply paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section to determine whether the substantial improvement requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii) is met.
