(iv)-(A)When reporting a sale of a covered security, a broker must take into account all information, other than the classification of the security (such as stock), furnished on a transfer statement (as described in ยง 1.6045A-1) and all information furnished or deemed furnished on an issuer statement (as described in ยง 1.6045B-1), unless the statement is incomplete or the broker has actual knowledge that it is incorrect.

A failure to report correct information that arises solely from reliance on information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement is deemed to be due to reasonable cause for purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722.ยง 301.6724-1(a)(1) of this chapter.
