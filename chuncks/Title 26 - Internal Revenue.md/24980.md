####### When payment is earned.

(ii)Under the non-AFS deferral method, a payment is earned when the all events test described in ยง 1.451-1(a) is met, without regard to when the amount is received, as defined under paragraph (a)(14) of this section, by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer is unable to determine the extent to which a payment is earned in the taxable year of receipt, or a short taxable year described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, if applicable, the taxpayer may calculate the amount:

(A) On a statistical basis if adequate data are available to the taxpayer;

(B) On a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement if the taxpayer receives the advance payment under a fixed term agreement and if it is reasonable to anticipate at the end of the taxable year of receipt that the advance payment will be earned ratably over the term of the agreement; or

(C) Using any other method that may be provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see ยง 601.601(d) of this chapter).
