####### Effective/applicability dates,In general.

(f)-(1)Under section 414(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the provisions of section 249 and this section shall apply to any repurchase of a convertible obligation occurring after April 22, 1969, other than a convertible obligation repurchased pursuant to a binding obligation incurred on or before April 22, 1969, to repurchase such convertible obligation at a specified call premium. A binding obligation on or before such date may arise if, for example, the issuer irrevocably obligates itself, on or before such date, to repurchase the convertible obligation at a specified price after such date, or if, for example, the issuer, without regard to the terms of the convertible obligation, negotiates a contract which, on or before such date, irrevocably obligates the issuer to repurchase the convertible obligation at a specified price after such date. A binding obligation on or before such date does not include a privilege in the convertible obligation permitting the issuer to call such convertible obligation after such date, which privilege was not exercised on or before such date.
