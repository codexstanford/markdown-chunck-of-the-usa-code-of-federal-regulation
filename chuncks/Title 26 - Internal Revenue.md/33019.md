####### Tiered partnerships,Assumption by a lower-tier partnership.,Example 3

(ii)-(A)If, in a § 1.752-7 liability transfer, a partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes a § 1.752-7 liability from another partnership (upper-tier partnership), then both the upper-tier partnership and the partners of the upper-tier partnership are § 1.752-7 liability partners. Therefore, paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply on a sale or liquidation of any partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership and on a sale or liquidation of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership. See paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If, in a § 1.752-7 liability transfer, the upper-tier partnership assumes a § 1.752-7 liability from a partner, and, subsequently, in another § 1.752-7 liability transfer, a lower-tier partnership assumes that § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the partner from whom the upper-tier partnership assumed the § 1.752-7 liability continues to be the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the lower-tier partnership with respect to the remaining built-in loss associated with that § 1.752-7 liability. Any new built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability that is created on the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership by the lower-tier partnership is shared by all the partners of the upper-tier partnership in accordance with their interests in the upper-tier partnership, and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as a § 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that new built-in loss. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii),of this section.
