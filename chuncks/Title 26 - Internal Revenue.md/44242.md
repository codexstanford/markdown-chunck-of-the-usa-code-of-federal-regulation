####### Election,Time and manner of making election,In general.

(2)-(i)-(A)Unless otherwise provided in the return or in the instructions for a return for a taxable year, any election made under section 1033(g)(3) shall be made by attaching a statement to the return (or amended return if filed on or before July 21, 1981) for the first taxable year to which the election is to apply. Any election made under this paragraph must be made not later than the time, including extensions thereof, prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for such taxable year or July 21, 1981, whichever occurs last. If a taxpayer makes an election (or revokes an election under subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph (b) (2)) for a taxable year for which he or she has previously filed a return, the return for that taxable year and all other taxable years affected by the election (or revocation) must be amended to reflect any tax consequences of the election (or revocation). However, no return for a taxable year for which the period for filing a claim for credit or refund under section 6511 has expired may be amended to make any changes other than those resulting from the election (or revocation). In order for the election (or revocation) to be effective, the taxpayer must remit with the amended return any additional tax due resulting from the election (or revocation), notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any other law which would prevent assessment or collection of such tax.
