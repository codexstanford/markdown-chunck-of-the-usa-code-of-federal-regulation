###### ยง 1.6694-2 Penalty for understatement due to an unreasonable position.
####### Nature of the error causing the understatement.

(1)The error resulted from a provision that was complex, uncommon, or highly technical, and a competent tax return preparer of tax returns or claims for refund of the type at issue reasonably could have made the error. The reasonable cause and good faith exception, however, does not apply to an error that would have been apparent from a general review of the return or claim for refund by the tax return preparer.
