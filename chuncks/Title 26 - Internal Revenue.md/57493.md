(8)-(i)Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the termgenerally means, on any date, with respect to any interest in a life insurance contract, any person that bears any part of the risk with respect to the contract on that date and any person responsible on that date for administering the contract, including collecting premiums and paying death benefits. For instance, if a reinsurer reinsures on an indemnity basis all or a portion of the risks that the original issuer (and continuing contract administrator) of the contract might otherwise have incurred with respect to the contract, both the reinsurer and the original issuer of the contract are issuers of the contract for purposes of this paragraph (a)(8)(i). Any designee of an issuer of a contract is also considered an issuer of the contract for purposes of this paragraph (a)(8)(i).
