####### Depreciation sustained on property retired before the changeover date.

(2)Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was claimed as the basis and which was retired before the changeover date by the taxpayer or a predecessor, except that:

(i) The adjustment shall be made only if a deduction was allowed in computing net income by reason of the retirement and the deduction so allowed was computed on the basis of the cost of the property unadjusted for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, and

(ii) In the case of any such property retired during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1929, the adjustment shall not exceed that portion of the amount attributable to depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which resulted, by reason of the deduction so allowed, in a reduction of taxes under the Code or under prior income, war-profits or excess-profits tax laws.
