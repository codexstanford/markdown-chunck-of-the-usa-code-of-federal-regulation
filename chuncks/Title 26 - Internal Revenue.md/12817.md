(4)-(i)The termmeans, with respect to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder, an account of the section 245A shareholder (the initial balance of which is zero), adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section on the last day of each taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. The basis benefit account must be maintained in the same functional currency as the extraordinary disposition account.

(A) The balance of the basis benefit account is increased to the extent that a basis benefit amount with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is assigned to the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. However, if the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is less than 100 percent, then, the basis benefit account is instead increased by the amount equal to the basis benefit amount multiplied by the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage.

(B) The balance of the basis benefit account is decreased to the extent that, for a taxable year that includes the date on which the section 245A shareholder's taxable year ends, disqualified basis of an item of specified property would have been reduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section but for an amount in the basis benefit account.
