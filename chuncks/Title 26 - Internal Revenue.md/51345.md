####### Jointly held accounts.

(iii)With respect to a jointly held account, each joint holder is treated as an account holder for purposes of determining whether the account is a U.S. account. Thus, an account is a U.S. account if any of the account holders is a specified U.S. person or a U.S. owned foreign entity and the account is not otherwise excepted from U.S. account status under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. When more than one U.S. person is a joint holder, each U.S. person will be treated as an account holder and will be attributed the entire balance of the jointly held account, including for purposes of applying the aggregation rules set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
