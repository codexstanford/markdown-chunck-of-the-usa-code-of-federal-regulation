####### Determination of deposit status,Rules for calendar years 1994 and 1995.

(c)-(1)On January 1, 1994, a taxpayer's depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the same as the taxpayer's status on January 1, 1994, for taxes reported on Form 941 under ยง 31.6302-1. A taxpayer generally retains that depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes for all of calendar years 1994 and 1995. However, a taxpayer that under this paragraph (c) is a monthly depositor for 1994 and 1995 will immediately lose that status and become a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes if the One-Day rule of ยง 31.6302-1(c)(3) is triggered with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of ยง 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.
