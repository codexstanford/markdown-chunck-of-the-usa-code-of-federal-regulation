A constitutional home rule city is also treated as a "State" for purposes of the set-aside requirement for housing credit allocations to projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization.paragraph (c)(5) of this section for rules governing set-aside requirements. In this connection, a constitutional home rule city may agree with the State housing credit agency to exchange an apportionment set aside for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization for an apportionment that is not so restricted. In such a case, the authorizing gubernatorial act, State statute, or State housing credit agency regulation (if authorized by gubernatorial act or State statute) must ensure that the set-aside apportionment transferred to the State housing credit agency be used for the purposes described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
