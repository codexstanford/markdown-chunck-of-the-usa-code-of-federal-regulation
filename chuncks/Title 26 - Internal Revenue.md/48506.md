####### Example 2. Transfer of built-in gain property with basis in excess of eligible gain to be deferred.,1,Example 1,1

(B)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(A)() of this section (), except that B realizes $50 of eligible gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, B's qualifying investment cannot exceed the amount of eligible gain to be deferred (that is, the $50 of eligible gain) under the section 1400Z-2(a) election. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B)() of this section, B's qualifying investment is $50 (the lesser of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest received, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), of $60 and the $100 fair market value of the eligible interest, limited by the amount of eligible gain to be deferred under the section 1400Z-2(a) election). B's qualifying investment has an adjusted basis of $0, as provided in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i). Additionally, B's non-qualifying investment is $50 (the excess of the fair market value of the eligible interest received ($100) over the amount ($50) of B's section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) investment). B's basis in the non-qualifying investment is $10 (B's $60 basis in its investment determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)), reduced by the $50 of adjusted basis allocated to B's qualifying investment, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B).
