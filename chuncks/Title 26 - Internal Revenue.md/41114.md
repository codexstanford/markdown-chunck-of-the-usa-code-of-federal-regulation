####### Analysis.,Example 1

(B)As in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section (the analysis in), USP's aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC is $100x, the lesser of USP's pro rata share of the average amounts of United States property held by FC ($120x) and its pro rata share of FC's applicable earnings ($100x). However, paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not reduce USP's section 956 amount because USP would not be allowed any deduction under section 245A with respect to the $100x hypothetical distribution by reason of section 959(a) and (d). Accordingly, USP's section 956 amount is $100x. However, under sections 959(a)(2) and 959(f)(1), USP's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(B) with respect to FC is $0, because USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC does not exceed the earnings and profits of FC described in section 959(c)(2) with respect to USP. The $100x of earnings and profits of FC described in section 959(c)(2) are reclassified as earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1).
