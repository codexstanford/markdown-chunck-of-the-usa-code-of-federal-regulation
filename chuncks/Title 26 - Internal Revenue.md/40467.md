####### Property defined.

(1)The term "property" means any interest of an insured in tangible (including real and personal) or intangible property. Such interests include, but are not limited to, those of an owner, landlord, tenant, mortgagor, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or partner. Thus, for example, if insurance is issued against loss from fire and theft with respect to an insured's home and its contents, such risks are risks in connection with property, whether the insured is the owner or lessee and whether the contents include furniture or cash and securities. Furthermore, if insurance is issued against all risks of damage or loss with respect to the automobile of an insured, such risks are risks in connection with property, whether the risks insured against may be caused by the insured, another person, or natural forces.
