(B)() The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section (), except that, rather than accelerating the plan loan, Plan Y permits Employee A to continue making loan installment payments after severance from employment. Employee A continues making loan installment payments until January 1, 2021, at which time Employee A does not make the loan installment payment due on January 1, 2021. In accordance with ยง 1.72(p)-1, Q&A-10, Plan Y allows a cure period that continues until the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the required installment payment was due. Employee A does not make a plan loan installment payment during the cure period. Plan Y offsets the unpaid $3,000 loan balance against Employee A's account balance on July 1, 2021 (which is after the 12-month period beginning on the date that Employee A severed from employment).
