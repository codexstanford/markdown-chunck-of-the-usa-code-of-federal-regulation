####### Taxable year 2024.

(E)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), D is required to include $100x in gross income through the end of 2024 as $100x is due under the terms of the contract and received by D as of the end of 2024. Under the AFS income inclusion rule, because D has an enforceable right to recover all $100x reported as AFS revenue through the end of 2024 if the customer were to terminate the contract on the last day of such year, all $100x is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" through the last day of 2024. Under the cumulative rule in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, D compares the cumulative all events test amount of $100x with the cumulative AFS revenue amount of $100x and selects the larger of the two amounts (or, if the two amounts are equal, the equal amount). From this equal amount of $100x, D subtracts the prior income inclusion amount of $75x ($50x from 2021 plus $0x from 2022 plus $25x from 2023). Accordingly, under the cumulative rule D is required to include $25 in gross income in 2024. The example in this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(E) is summarized in the following table:
