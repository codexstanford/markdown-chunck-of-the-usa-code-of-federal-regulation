(3)A trust which is not a trust described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), is treated as a resident of the State in which the principal contributor to the trust, during the 3-year period ending on the date of the creation of the trust, had his principal place of residence for an aggregate number of days longer than the aggregate number of days he had his principal place of residence in any other State. However, if the principal contributor to such a trust was not a resident of any State at any time during such 3-year period, then the trust is not treated as a resident of any State.
