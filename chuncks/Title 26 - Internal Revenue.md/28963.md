(b)-(1)Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, an organization identifies each of its separate unrelated trades or businesses using the first two digits of the North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS 2-digit code) that most accurately describes the unrelated trade or business based on the more specific NAICS code, such as at the 6-digit level, that describes the activity it conducts and subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The descriptions in the current NAICS manual (available at) of trades or businesses using more than two digits of the NAICS codes are relevant in this determination. In the case of the sale of goods, both online and in stores, the separate unrelated trade or business is identified by the goods sold in stores if the same goods generally are sold both online and in stores.
