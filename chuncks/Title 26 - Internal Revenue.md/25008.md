####### Analysis.

(B)For 2022, A's advance payment inventory inclusion amount is $40x, which is the amount of the advance payment that, but for the cost of goods in progress offset, would be includable in gross income in 2022 under the deferral method. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section A reduces such amount by the $35x cost of goods in progress offset, determined as the costs of goods through the end of 2022 ($0 costs incurred in 2021 plus $35x costs incurred in 2022 = $35x). A is required to include this net amount of $5x in gross income in 2022. The remaining portion of the payment ($35x) is deferred and included in gross income in 2024, the taxable year in which ownership of the good is transferred to the customer.
