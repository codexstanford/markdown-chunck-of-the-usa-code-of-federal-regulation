(ii) That, as a result of such underreporting, the payor is required under section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code to withhold 20 percent of reportable interest and dividend payments made to the payee no later than the close of the day 30 days after the date that the payor received the notice;

(iii) The date that the payor received the notice to begin backup withholding under 3406(a)(1)(C);

(iv) That the payee must obtain a determination from the Internal Revenue Service in order to stop the backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C); and

(v) That while he is subject to backup withholding due to payee underreporting, the payee may not certify to a payor making reportable interest or dividend payments (or to a broker acquiring a readily tradable instrument for the payee) that he is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). See section 3406(a)(1)(D) for the backup withholding rules with respect to a payee's failure to make the certification under section 3406(a)(1)(D).
