###### § 1.267A-5 Definitions and special rules.
####### Coordination with capitalization and recovery provisions.

(iii)To the extent a specified payment is described in § 1.267A-1(b), a deduction for the payment is considered permanently disallowed for all purposes of the Code and regulations in this part and, therefore, the payment is not taken into account for purposes of computing costs that are required to be capitalized and recovered through depreciation, amortization, cost of goods sold, adjustment to basis, or similar forms of recovery under any applicable provision of the Code or in regulations in this part. Thus, for example, to the extent an interest or royalty payment is a specified payment described in § 1.267A-1(b), the payment is not capitalized and included in inventory cost or added to basis under section 263A. As an additional example, to the extent that a debt issuance cost is a specified payment described in § 1.267A-1(b), it is neither capitalized under section 263 or the regulations in this part under section 263 nor recoverable under § 1.446-5.
