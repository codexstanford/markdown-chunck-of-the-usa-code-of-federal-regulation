######## In general.

(a)The treatment of items as partnership items with respect to a partner against whom an assessment of income tax under section 6851 (termination assessment) or section 6861 (jeopardy assessment) is made will interfere with the effective and efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending with or within the partner's taxable year for which an assessment of income tax under section 6851 or 6861 is made shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the moment before such assessment is made.
