####### Treatment of non-look-through pools in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004.,See

(iii)Undistributed earnings (or a deficit) and taxes in the non-look-through pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as of the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, as if they were accumulated and paid during a period in which a distribution out of earnings in the non-look-through pool would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Such earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be added to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. In accordance with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must reconstruct the non-look-through pools or, if the taxpayer chooses to use the safe harbor method, allocate the earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. Under the safe harbor method, this allocation is made in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the foreign corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002.ยง 1.861-12T(c)(3) and ยง 1.861-12(c)(4). If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings (or deficit) and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be allocated to the foreign corporation's passive category.
