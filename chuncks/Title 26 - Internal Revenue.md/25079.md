(d)An election to change to the installment method for a type of sale applies only with respect to sales made on or after the first day of the taxable year of change. Thus, payments received in the taxable year of the change, or in subsequent years, in respect of an installment obligation which arose in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of change are not taken into account on the installment method, but rather must be accounted for under the taxpayer's method of accounting in use in the prior year.
