####### Introduction.

(a)Section 1382(b) provides that the amount of certain patronage dividends (and amounts paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation) shall not be taken into account by a cooperative organization in determining its taxable income. Such section also provides that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, an amount not taken into account is to be treated in the same manner as an item of gross income and as a deduction therefrom. Therefore, such an amount is treated as a deduction for purposes of applying the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder and, for simplicity, is referred to as a deduction in the regulations under such Code. However, this should not be regarded as a determination of the character of the amount for other purposes.
