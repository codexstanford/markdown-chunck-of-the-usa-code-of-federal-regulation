(vi)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section (), except that, in addition, during 2021 F sold an additional 400 R common shares, and, as with the other sale, F did not adequately identify which investment in QOF R F sold. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, F must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in R were disposed of. As determined by this identification, F sold the 400 common shares which were associated with the deferral of $500 of short-term capital gain. Thus, the deferred gain that must be included upon sale of the 400 R common shares is short-term capital gain.
