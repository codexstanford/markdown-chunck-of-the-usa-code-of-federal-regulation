####### Deemed distribution and recontribution,1,In general.,2

(B)-()If any partner of a QOF partnership, or shareholder of a QOF S corporation, makes an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer is treated as receiving a distribution of cash as calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)() of this section, from the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation at the end of the QOF partnership's or QOF S corporation's taxable year and immediately recontributing the cash to the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation in exchange for a non-qualifying investment in the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation. In determining the post-contribution qualifying investment and non-qualifying investment, the QOF will value each interest based on the underlying values of the QOF's assets determined at the end of its taxable year in accordance with the principles of ยง 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (in the case of a QOF partnership) or fair market value (in the case of a QOF S corporation). If the QOF partner or QOF S corporation shareholder is a mixed-funds partner or shareholder prior to the sale or exchange, the deemed distribution will be treated as made proportionately with respect to the partner's or shareholder's qualifying investment and non-qualifying investment in the QOF partnership in accordance with ยง 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iv)(B), or the QOF S corporation. The distribution and recontribution rule of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is solely for purposes of determining the taxpayer's interests in the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation that constitute a qualifying investment and a non-qualifying investment, and has no other Federal income tax consequence (for example, the rule does not affect the accumulated adjustments account of an S corporation and cannot be treated as a disproportionate distribution by an S corporation).
