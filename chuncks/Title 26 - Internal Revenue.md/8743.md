##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.165-4 Decline in value of stock.
####### Deduction disallowed.

(a)No deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) solely on account of a decline in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer when the decline is due to a fluctuation in the market price of the stock or to other similar cause. A mere shrinkage in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer, even though extensive, does not give rise to a deduction under section 165(a) if the stock has any recognizable value on the date claimed as the date of loss. No loss for a decline in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) except insofar as the loss is recognized under ยง 1.1002-1 upon the sale or exchange of the stock and except as otherwise provided in ยง 1.165-5 with respect to stock which becomes worthless during the taxable year.
