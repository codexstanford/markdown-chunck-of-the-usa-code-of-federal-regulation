(2)For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, each head of a Federal agency or of a wholly owned instrumentality of the United States who makes a return pursuant to section 3122 (and each agent designated by a head of a Federal agency or instrumentality who makes a return pursuant to such section) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term "wages" includes the amount which each such head (or agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) () through () of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents of one or more Federal agencies and the amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from an agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
