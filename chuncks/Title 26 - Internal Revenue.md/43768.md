###### § 1.1001-6 Transition from certain interbank offered rates.
####### § 1.1275-6 interim hedge

(i) A covered modification of one or more contracts that are part of an integrated transaction under § 1.1275-6 is treated as not legging out of the integrated transaction, provided that, no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of any such contract, the financial instrument that results from any such covered modifications satisfies the requirements to be a § 1.1275-6 hedge (as defined in § 1.1275-6(b)(2)) with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that results from any such covered modification. If a taxpayer enters into a financial instrument intended to mitigate the economic effect of a temporary mismatch of the legs of the integrated transaction during that 90-day period (a), the integration of the § 1.1275-6 interim hedge with the other components of the integrated transaction during the 90-day period is treated as not legging into a new integrated transaction and the termination of the § 1.1275-6 interim hedge before the end of the 90-day period is treated as not legging out of the existing integrated transaction.
