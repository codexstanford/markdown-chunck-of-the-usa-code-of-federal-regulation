###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### No series of related transactions.

(iv)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, except that Parent's acquisition of the G stock and B's purchase of Equipment #3 are not part of the same series of related transactions. Because B's purchase of Equipment #3 and Parent's acquisition of the G stock did not occur pursuant to the same series of related transactions, the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule does not apply. In addition, B is not treated under the Group Prior Use Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 at the time of the purchase because neither G nor any other member of the Parent group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 while a member of the Parent group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B's acquisition of Equipment #3 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. Assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2019.
