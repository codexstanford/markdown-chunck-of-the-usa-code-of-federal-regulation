###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Example 1.

(A)For Year 1, USP, a domestic corporation, has a net foreign currency gain that would not constitute foreign personal holding company income if USP were a controlled foreign corporation because the gain is directly related to the business needs of USP. See section 954(c)(1)(D). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the foreign currency gain is, therefore, not passive category income to USP because it is not income of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income.
