######## Comparison of services rendered before and after retirement.

(C)In addition, consideration is given to the nature and extent of the services rendered by the individual before he "retired," as compared with the services performed thereafter. A large reduction in the importance or amount of services performed by the individual in the exercise of duties required by his religious order tends to show that the individual is retired; absence of such reduction tends to show that the individual is not retired. Normally, an individual who reduces by at least 75 percent the amount of services performed shall be considered retired.
