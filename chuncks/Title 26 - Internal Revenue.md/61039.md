###### Devalued securities.

(d)In the event the Administration determines that the market value at any date of any securities in the fund has decreased to a figure which is less than 90 percent of the market value at the time of deposit into the fund, then within 60 days after the taxpayer receives notice of such determination the taxpayer shall (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) deposit into the fund cash or securities in an amount equal to the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit. However if any securities in the fund are valued at the time of their deposit at less than the market value of such securities at the time of their deposit the taxpayer shall be required to deposit only an amount equal to that portion of the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit which bears the same ratio to such total difference as the amount at which the securities were valued at the time of their deposit bears to the market value at the time of such deposit.
