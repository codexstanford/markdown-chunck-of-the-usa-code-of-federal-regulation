####### Voluntary termination of employment.

(b)A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of paragraph (a) of ยง 1.50A-3 if the employee voluntarily leaves the employment of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer makes the working conditions of the employee so untenable that the employee is, in effect, compelled by the taxpayer to quit, or if the employee is coerced into quitting, the employee will not be deemed to have voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a substantial reduction in the benefits of employment of an employee (such as a substantial decrease in the hours of the employee's working week) shall constitute untenable working conditions. An employee has voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer if he leaves for any reason external to his employment, such as sickness or death in the employee's family which the employee feels necessitates his quitting work with the taxpayer to remain at home. Any employee who participates in an authorized strike (as finally determined by a court, labor relations administrative body, or arbiter) will not be deemed to have voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer.
