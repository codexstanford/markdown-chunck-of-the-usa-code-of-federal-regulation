####### Church loan.

(8)The term "church loan" means a loan secured by an interest in real property which is used primarily for church purposes, or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term "church purposes" means the ministration of sacerdotal functions, the conduct of religious worship and closely associated activities designed primarily to provide fellowship among members of the congregation, or the instruction of religion. Thus, a parish hall would normally qualify as property used primarily for church purposes, whereas a building used primarily to furnish education, other than the instruction of religion, would not.
