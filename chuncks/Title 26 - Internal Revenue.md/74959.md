######## Example 1.

(i)Corporation R fails to file timely 11,000 Forms 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous income) for the 1990 calendar year. Five thousand of these returns are filed with correct information within 30 days, and 6,000 after 30 days but on or before August 1, 1991. For the same year R fails to file timely 400 Forms 1099-INT (relating to payments of interest) which R eventually files on September 28, 1991, after the period for reduction of the penalty has elapsed. R is subject to a penalty of $20,000 for the 400 forms which were not filed by August 1 ($50 x 400 = $20,000), $150,000 for the 6,000 forms filed after 30 days ($30 x 6,000 = $180,000, limited to $150,000 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and $75,000 for the 5,000 forms filed within 30 days ($15 x 5,000 = $75,000), for a total penalty of $245,000.
