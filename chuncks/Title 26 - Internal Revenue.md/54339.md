For U.S. tax purposes, DE1's tax basis in A at the beginning of year 1 is $100x and DE1's sole item of income, gain, deduction, and loss for year 1 is a $20x depreciation deduction attributable to A. As a result, the $20x depreciation deduction constitutes a dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1. P makes a domestic use election with respect to the year 1 dual consolidated loss.
