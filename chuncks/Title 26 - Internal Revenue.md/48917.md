####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the acquisition of the land is a transaction carried out to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Consequently, the land is not qualified opportunity zone business property and gain from the sale of the land will not be eligible to be excluded from gross income under section 1400Z-2(c). This recharacterization of the qualification of the land for Federal tax purposes is appropriate to ensure that the tax results of the transaction, including the status of Partnership D as a qualified opportunity zone business, are consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Partnership D fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business unless other assets that it owns or leases are qualified opportunity zone business property that satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i), and the other requirements of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
