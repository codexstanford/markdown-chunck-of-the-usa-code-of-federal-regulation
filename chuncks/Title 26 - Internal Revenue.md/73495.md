######## Example 3.,Example 2

(3)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that on June 1, 2023, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, PR signs an agreement extending the period for making partnership adjustments under section 6235(a) for Partnership's 2020 taxable year to December 31, 2025. In addition, on June 2, 2025, the IRS mails to Partnership and PR a timely NOPPA under section 6231(a)(2). Pursuant to ยง 301.6225-2(c)(3)(i), the period for requesting modification expires on February 27, 2026 (270 days after June 2, 2025, the date the NOPPA is mailed), but PR does not submit a request for modification on or before this date. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the date for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section is April 28, 2026, the date that is 330 days from the mailing of the NOPPA. Because April 28, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section), and because no modification was requested, paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not applicable, April 28, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
