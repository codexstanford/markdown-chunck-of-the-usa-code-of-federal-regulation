####### Filing by electing member.

(ii)An electing member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is made. If the electing member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing member (or the United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.
