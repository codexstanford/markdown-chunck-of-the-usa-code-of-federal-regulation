####### Rules for determining amount of employer-provided social security retirement benefit.

(3)For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the following rules apply.

(ii) The employer-provided primary insurance amount attributable to service by the employee for the employer is determined by multiplying the employer-provided portion of the employee's projected primary insurance amount by a fraction (not exceeding 1), the numerator of which is the employee's number of complete years of covered service for the employer under the Social Security Act, and the denominator of which is 35.
