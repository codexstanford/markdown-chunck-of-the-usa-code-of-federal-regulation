###### ยง 1.467-7 Section 467 recapture and other rules relating to dispositions and modifications.
####### Dispositions by transferee.

(4)If the recapture amount with respect to a disposition of property (the first disposition) is limited under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, or under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022, and the transferee subsequently disposes of the property in a transaction to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, the prior understated inclusion determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is computed by taking into account the amounts attributable to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition. Thus, for example, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest that would have been taken into account by the transferee if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement subject to constant rental accrual include the amounts that would have been taken into account by the transferor, and the aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest accrued by the transferee includes the aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest that was taken into account by the transferor. The prior understated inclusion determined under this paragraph (c)(4) must be reduced by any recapture amount taken into account under paragraph (a) of this section by the transferor.
