####### Procedure for filing a combined return.

(iii)A combined return is made by filing a single corporation income tax return in lieu of separate deemed sale returns for all targets required to be included in the combined return. The combined return reflects the deemed asset sales of all targets required to be included in the combined return. If the targets included in the combined return constitute a single affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504(a), the income tax return is signed by an officer of the common parent of that group. Otherwise, the return must be signed by an officer of each target included in the combined return. Rules similar to the rules in ยง 1.1502-75(j) apply for purposes of preparing the combined return. The combined return must include a statement entitled, "ELECTION TO FILE A COMBINED RETURN UNDER SECTION 338(h)(15)." The statement must include-

(A) The name, address, and employer identification number of each target required to be included in the combined return; and

(B) The following declaration: EACH TARGET IDENTIFIED IN THIS ELECTION TO FILE A COMBINED RETURN CONSENTS TO THE FILING OF A COMBINED RETURN.
