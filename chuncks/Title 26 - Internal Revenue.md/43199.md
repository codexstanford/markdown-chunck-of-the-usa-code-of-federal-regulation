(ii)In the case of a corporation which holds continuously an asset which is not a qualified export asset at the close of more than 1 taxable year, it must distribute an amount equal to its fair market value (or, if greater, the amount determined under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) only once if, at the close of the first such taxable year, such corporation reasonably believed that such asset was a qualified export asset.
