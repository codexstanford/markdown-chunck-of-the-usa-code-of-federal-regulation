####### Yield on a separate class of investments,In general.

(2)-(i)For purposes of the yield restriction rules of section 148(a) and ยง 1.148-2, yield is computed separately for each class of investments. For this purpose, in determining the yield on a separate class of investments, the yield on each individual investment within the class is blended with the yield on other individual investments within the class, whether or not held concurrently, by treating those investments as a single investment. The yields on investments that are not within the same class are not blended.
