####### Self-construction.

(d)The term "self-construction" means the construction of a residence (other than a factory-made home) to the taxpayer's specifications on land already owned or leased by the taxpayer at the time of commencement of construction. Thus, where a taxpayer purchases land and either builds a residence himself or hires an architect and a contractor to build a residence on that land, the taxpayer has "self-constructed" the residence.
