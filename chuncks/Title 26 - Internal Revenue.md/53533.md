###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### B purchases Equipment #3 in 2024.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, except that B acquires and places in service Equipment #3 in 2024 instead of 2019. B is not treated under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 because G (which sold Equipment #3 to U in 2018) did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. In addition, B is not treated under the Group Prior Use Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 at the time of the purchase because neither G nor any other member of the Parent group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 while a member of the Parent group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B's acquisition of Equipment #3 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. Assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2024.
