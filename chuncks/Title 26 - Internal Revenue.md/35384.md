(ii)For purposes of this section, additional production activities are substantial production activities performed directly by the taxpayer in addition to activities from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural deposit, or uncut timber. Whether a taxpayer's activities constitute additional production activities will be determined under the principles of ยง 1.954-3(a)(4) (except for ยง 1.954-3(a)(4)(iv)). However, in no case will activities that prepare the natural resource itself for export, including those that are designed to facilitate the transportation of the natural resource, be considered additional production activities for purposes of this section.
