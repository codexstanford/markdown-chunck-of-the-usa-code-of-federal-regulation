()Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A), Company N is treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business with respect to the leased mixed-use building. While Company N leases the third floor of the building to tenant X merely under a triple-net-lease, and therefore the employees of Company N do not meaningfully participate in the management or operations of that floor, the employees of Company N meaningfully participate in the management and operations of the first and second floors of the leased building. Therefore, in carrying out the overall leasing business of Company N with respect to the mixed-use building, employees of Company N conduct meaningful managerial and operational activities. As a result, Company N conducts an active trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone.
