(3)(i) If a Federal executive agency enters into an initial contract on December 1, 1988, and the amount of money obligated under the contract is increased by $55,000 on April 15, 1990, then there is no reporting requirement with respect to the contract when entered into on December 1, 1988. However, the April 15, 1990, increase, which is treated as a new contract under paragraph (e) of this section, is subject to the reporting requirements of this section because it is considered to be a new contract entered into on April 15, 1990.

(ii) If the $55,000 increase had occurred before April 1, 1990, there would not have been a reporting requirement with respect to that increase.
