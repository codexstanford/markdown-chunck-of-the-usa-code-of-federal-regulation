####### Example 6.

(vi)(A) M owns Industrial Facility Z. No other taxpayer has ever owned Z, and M has never allowed another taxpayer to claim any section 45Q credits with respect to qualified carbon oxide captured from Z. M captured 1,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually in each of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. All captured carbon dioxide was sold to N for use a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil recovery project. N provided contractual assurance that the carbon dioxide would be sequestered in secure geological storage. M claimed section 45Q credit amounts of $12,830,000 in 2017, $15,209,000 in 2018, $17,760,000 in 2019, $20,220,000 in 2020, $22,680,000 in 2021, $25,150,000 in 2022, $27,610,000 in 2023, $30,070,000 in 2024, and $32,540,000 in 2025 using the statutory rates in ยง 1.45Q-1(d)(3). No injection of carbon oxides takes place in 2026. In 2026, N determined that 6,200,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide previously injected had leaked from the containment area of the reservoir and were released into the atmosphere.

(B) Because the leakage determined in 2025 (6,200,000 metric tons) exceed the amount stored in 2026 (0 metric tons) a recapture event occurred in 2026. A's credit for 2026 is $0 because the net amount of carbon dioxide captured and used as a tertiary injectant in 2026 was 0 metric tons. The 2026 recapture amount is calculated by multiplying the 6,200,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide by the appropriate statutory credit rate using the LIFO method. The first 1,000,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide is deemed attributable to 2025, and is recaptured at the 2025 statutory rate of $32.54 per metric ton. The next 1,000,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide is deemed attributable to 2024, and is recaptured at the 2024 statutory rate of $30.07 per metric ton. The next 1,000,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide is deemed attributable to 2023, and is recaptured at the 2023 statutory rate of $27.16 per metric ton. The remaining 3,200,000 metric tons are not subject to recapture because of the three-year lookback limit in ยง 1.45Q-1(g)(2). Thus, the total recapture amount is $89,770,000, and is added to A's tax due for 2026.
