###### ยง 20.2010-3 Portability provisions applicable to the surviving spouse's estate.
####### Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent marriage or divorce.

(3)A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined in ยง 20.2010-1(e)(5)) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of the death of the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse is married to another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the last deceased spouse as that term is defined in ยง 20.2010-1(e)(5).
