(ii) A producer may elect one of two allocation ratios, the labor-based allocation ratio or the production cost allocation ratio. A reseller that satisfies the requirements for using the simplified resale method of ยง 1.263A-3(d) (whether or not that method is elected) may elect the simplified service cost method, but must use a labor-based allocation ratio.

The allocation ratio used by a trade or business of a taxpayer is a method of accounting which must be applied consistently within the trade or business.
