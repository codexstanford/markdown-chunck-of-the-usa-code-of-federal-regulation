###### ยง 1.385-4 Treatment of consolidated groups.
####### Consolidated group debt instrument that is transferred outside of the consolidated group.,Examples 2,3

(ii)For purposes of this section and ยง 1.385-3, when a member of a consolidated group that holds a consolidated group debt instrument transfers the debt instrument to an expanded group member that is not a member of the same consolidated group (transferee expanded group member), the debt instrument is treated as issued by the consolidated group to the transferee expanded group member immediately after the debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. Thus, for example, for purposes of this section and ยง 1.385-3, the sale of a consolidated group debt instrument to a transferee expanded group member is treated as an issuance of the debt instrument by the consolidated group to the transferee expanded group member in exchange for property. To the extent the newly-issued debt instrument is a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock upon being transferred, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the member of the consolidated group treated as the issuer of the debt instrument (determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) immediately after the covered debt instrument is transferred outside of the consolidated group. For rules regarding the treatment of the deemed exchange, see ยง 1.385-1(d). For examples illustrating the rule in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), see paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section (and).
