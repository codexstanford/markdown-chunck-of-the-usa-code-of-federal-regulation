()DC's patent covering a process for refining crude oil is a manufacturing method or process as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section, FP is treated as the end user of the patent, and is treated as located outside the United States because FP is a foreign unrelated party and DC does not know or have reason to know that the patented process will be used in the United States. As a result, all of the sale to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore is a FDDEI sale. The entire $100x lump sum payment is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.
