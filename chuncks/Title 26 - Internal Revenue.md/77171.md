###### Taxation of Nonresident Aliens Who Are Residents of Denmark and of Danish Corporations
####### ยง 521.105 Scope of convention with respect to determination of "industrial or commercial profits".
######## No United States permanent establishment.

(b)A nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary and partnership) who is a resident of Denmark or a Danish corporation, carrying on an enterprise in Denmark and having no permanent establishment in the United States, is not for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1948, subject to United States income tax upon industrial or commercial profits from sources within the United States. For example, if the Danish enterprise carried on by such alien or corporation sells, in 1948, merchandise, such as silverware, dairy products, or liquors, through a bona fide commission agent or broker in the United States acting in the ordinary course of his business as such agent or broker, the resulting profits are, under the terms of Article III of the convention, exempt from United States income tax. Likewise no permanent establishment exists and no United States income tax attaches to such profits if such enterprise, through its sales agents in the United States, secures orders for its products, the sales being made in Denmark.
