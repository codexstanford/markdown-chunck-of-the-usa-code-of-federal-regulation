###### ยง 1.905-5 Foreign tax redeterminations of foreign corporations that relate to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018.
####### Timing and effect of pooling adjustments.

(d)The redetermination of U.S. tax liability required by paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section is made in accordance with section 905(c) as in effect for those taxable years, without regard (except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) to rules that required adjustments to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year of the foreign tax redetermination rather than in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. No underpayment or overpayment of U.S. tax liability results from a foreign tax redetermination unless the required adjustments change the U.S. tax liability. Consequently, no interest is paid by or to a taxpayer as a result of adjustments, required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination, to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates (or a subsequent year) that did not result in a change to U.S. tax liability, for example, because no foreign taxes were deemed paid in that year.
