####### ยง 301.6724-1 Reasonable cause.
######## Reasonable cause defined.

(2)The penalty is waived for reasonable cause only if the filer establishes that either-

(i) There are significant mitigating factors with respect to the failure, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; or

(ii) The failure arose from events beyond the filer's control ("impediment"), as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

Moreover, the filer must establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, both before and after the failure occurred. Thus, if the filer establishes that there are significant mitigating factors for a failure but is unable to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, the mitigating factors will not be sufficient to obtain a waiver of the penalty. Similarly, if the filer establishes that a failure arose from an impediment but is unable to establish that the filer acted in a responsible manner, the impediment will not be sufficient to obtain a waiver of the penalty. See paragraph (g) of this section for the reasonable cause safe harbor for persons who exercise due diligence.
