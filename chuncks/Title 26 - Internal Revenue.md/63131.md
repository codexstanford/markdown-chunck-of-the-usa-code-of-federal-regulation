###### § 25.2701-2 Special valuation rules for applicable retained interests.
####### Special rule for valuing a qualified payment right held in conjunction with an extraordinary payment right.

(3)If an applicable retained interest confers a qualified payment right and one or more extraordinary payment rights, the value of all these rights is determined by assuming that each extraordinary payment right is exercised in a manner that results in the lowest total value being determined for all the rights, using a consistent set of assumptions and giving due regard to the entity's net worth, prospective earning power, and other relevant factors (the "lower of" valuation rule). See §§ 20.2031-2(f) and 20.2031-3 for rules relating to the valuation of business interests generally.
