()Employer M provides free coffee, soda, bottled water, chips, donuts, and other snacks in a break room available to all employees. A break room is not a recreational, social, or similar activity primarily for the benefit of the employees, even if some socializing related to the food and beverages provided occurs. Thus, the exception in section 274(e)(4) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply and unless another exception in section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, M may deduct only 50 percent of the expenses for food and beverages provided in the break room under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
