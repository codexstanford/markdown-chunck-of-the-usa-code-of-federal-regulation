###### ยง 1.460-6 Look-back method.
####### De minimis exception.

(3)Notwithstanding that the percentage of completion method is otherwise required to be used, the look-back method does not apply to any long-term contract that:

(i) Is completed within 2 years of the contract commencement date, and

(ii) Has a gross contract price (as of the completion of the contract) that does not exceed the lesser of $1,000,000 or 1 percent of the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the 3 tax years preceding the tax year in which the contract is completed.

(iii) This de minimis exception is mandatory and, therefore, precludes application of the look-back method to any contract that meets the requirements of the exception. The de minimis exception applies for purposes of computing both regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income. Solely for this purpose, the determination of whether a long-term contract meets the gross receipts test for both alternative minimum tax and regular tax purposes is made based only on the taxpayer's regular taxable income. For contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, a taxpayer's gross receipts are determined in the manner required by regulations under section 448(c).
