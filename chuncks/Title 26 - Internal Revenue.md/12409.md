(4)Expenses of traveling include the cost of transportation and of meals and lodging en route (including the date of arrival) of both the taxpayer and members of his household, who have both the taxpayer's former residence and the taxpayer's new residence as their principal place of abode, from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence. Expenses of traveling do not include, for example: living or other expenses of the taxpayer and members of his household following their date of arrival at the new place of residence and while they are waiting to enter the new residence or waiting for their household goods to arrive; expenses in connection with house or apartment hunting; living expenses preceding the date of departure for the new place of residence; expenses of trips for purposes of selling property; expenses of trips to the former residence by the taxpayer pending the move by his family to the new place of residence; or any allowance for depreciation. The deduction for traveling expenses is allowable for only one trip made by the taxpayer and members of his household; however, it is not necessary that the taxpayer and all members of his household travel together or at the same time.
