####### Material failures defined.

(iv)A material failure is a failure of the participating FFI to fulfill the requirements of the FFI agreement if the failure was the result of a deliberate action on the part of one or more employees of the participating FFI (its agent, sponsor, or compliance FI) to avoid the requirements of the FFI agreement or was an error attributable to a failure of the participating FFI to implement internal controls sufficient for the participating FFI to meet the requirements of this section. A material failure will not constitute an event of default unless such material failure occurs in more than limited circumstances when a participating FFI has not substantially complied with the requirements of an FFI agreement. Material failures include the following-

(A) The deliberate or systemic failure of the participating FFI to report accounts that it was required to treat as U.S. accounts, withhold on passthru payments to the extent required, deposit taxes withheld, or accurately report recalcitrant account holders or payees that are nonparticipating FFIs as required;

(B) A criminal or civil penalty or sanction imposed on the participating FFI (or any branch or office thereof) by a regulator or other governmental authority or agency with oversight over the participating FFI's compliance with the AML due diligence procedures to which it (or any branch or office thereof) is subject and that is imposed based on a failure to properly identify account holders under the requirements of those procedures; and

(C) A potential future tax liability related to the participating FFI's compliance (or lack thereof) with the FFI agreement for which the FFI establishes, for financial statement purposes, a tax reserve or provision.
