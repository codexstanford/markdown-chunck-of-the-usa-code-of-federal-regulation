(7)The provisions of section 482 apply in determining a thrift institution's tentative taxable income, and in determining the gross income and deductions attributable to functionally related activities. For example, an expense such as the salary of an individual who performs services for both a thrift and a nonthrift must be allocated in a manner that fairly reflects the value of the services rendered to each.
