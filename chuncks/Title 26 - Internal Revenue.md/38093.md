()USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation organized and operating in Country X that uses the "u" as its functional currency. In Year 1, when the highest rate of U.S. tax in section 11 is 21%, CFC earns 100u of passive category foreign personal holding company income subject to no foreign tax. When included in USP's income under section 951(a), the applicable exchange rate is 1u=$1x. Therefore, USP's section 951(a) inclusion is $100x and no foreign taxes are deemed paid by USP with respect to the inclusion. At the end of Year 1, CFC has previously taxed earnings and profits of 100u and USP's basis in those earnings is $100x. In Year 2, CFC has no earnings and profits and distributes 100u to USP. The value of the earnings when distributed is $150x. Assume that under section 986(c), USP must recognize $50x of passive category income attributable to the appreciation of the previously taxed earnings and profits. Country X does not recognize any gain or loss on the distribution, but imposes a 10u withholding tax on USP with respect to the distribution.
