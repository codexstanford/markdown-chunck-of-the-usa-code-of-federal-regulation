###### ยง 301.6343-3 Return of property in certain cases.
####### Best interest of the taxpayer.

(ii)The National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) generally will determine whether the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer. If, however, a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to return property and has not specifically requested the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) to determine the taxpayer's best interest, a finding by the Commissioner that the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer will be sufficient to support the return of property. Only the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) may determine that a return of property is not in the best interest of the taxpayer.
