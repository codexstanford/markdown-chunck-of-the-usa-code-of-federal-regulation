###### ยง 48.4042-3 Certain types of commercial waterway transportation excluded.
####### Twelve foot draft,Definition.

(4)-(i)For purposes of section 4042(c)(1), "draft" shall mean the maximum vertical distance between the mean water line and the bottom of the keel. In cases where a vessel has a skeg or other appendage extending locally below the line of the keel, the draft shall be measured from the deepest appendage. A separage determination of draft must be made for each voyage when the vessel has its greatest load of cargo and fuel. For purposes of this determination, the term "voyage" means a round trip voyage. Therefore, if a vessel travels into the specified waterway system to pick up cargo and has a draft sufficient to qualify for the exclusion when loaded, then for purposes of section 4042(c)(1) the vessel satisfies the 12 foot draft requirement for the entire voyage. Similarly, if a vessel loaded with cargo travels into the specified waterway system with a draft sufficient to qualify for the exclusion provided by section 4042(c)(1), then the fuel consumed on the entire voyage may be excluded, regardless of the vessel's draft after the cargo is unloaded.
