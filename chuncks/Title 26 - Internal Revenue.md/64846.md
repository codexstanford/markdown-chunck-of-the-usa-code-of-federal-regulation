###### ยง 31.3406(b)(2)-4 Reportable dividend payment.
####### Reasonable estimate of amount of dividend subject to backup withholding.

(2)Pursuant to section 6042(b)(3) and ยง 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter, if the payor is unable to determine the portion of a distribution that is a dividend, the entire amount of the distribution must be treated as a dividend for information reporting under section 6042. Hence, withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution. If a payor is able reasonably to estimate under section 6042 and ยง 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend, however, the payor must not withhold on that portion (which is not considered a dividend). A payor making a payment, all or a portion of which may not be a dividend, may use previous experience to estimate the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend. The payor's estimate is considered reasonable if-

(i) The estimate does not exceed the proportion of the distributions made by the payor during the most recent calendar year for which a Form 1099 was required to be filed that was not reported by the payor as a dividend; and

(ii) The payor has no reasonable basis to expect that the proportion of the distribution that is not a dividend will be substantially different for the current year.
