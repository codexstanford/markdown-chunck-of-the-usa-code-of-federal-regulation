For purposes of determining this fraction, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is determined pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (by replacing the term "paragraph (b)(1)" in that paragraph with the term "paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)"). In addition, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is excluded from the denominator of the fraction to the extent the duplicate DQB is attributable to duplicate DQB of another item of exchanged basis property that is included in the denominator of the fraction.
