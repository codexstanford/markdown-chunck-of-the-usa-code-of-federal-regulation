####### Proceeds of certain loans not taken into account for Capital Interest Allocation purposes,General rule.

(v)-(A)For purposes of the Section 1061 Regulations, an allocation is not a Capital Interest Allocation to the extent the allocation is attributable to the contribution of an amount of capital to a partnership that, directly or indirectly, results from, or is attributable to, any loan or other advance made or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the partnership, a partner in the partnership, or any Related Person with respect to such persons, except to the extent a loan or advance is described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this section. However, the repayments on a loan described in the preceding sentence are taken into account as capital contributed (and may therefore generate Capital Interest Allocations) as those amounts are paid by the partner, provided that the loan is not repaid with the proceeds of another loan described in the preceding sentence.
