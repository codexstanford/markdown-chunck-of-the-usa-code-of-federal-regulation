####### Twenty-day average rule.

(ii)A special 20-day average valuation rule applies to certain publicly traded securities transferred by a corporation to a TRASOP. It does not apply to securities acquired with cash transferreed by a corporation to a TRASOP. Under the special rule, the term "value" refers to an average of daily closing prices for a security, as reported on any national securities exchange or as quoted on any system sponsored by a national securities association, over the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable last day described in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. The average is based on the closing prices for each day when the security is in fact traded during the 20-day period. However, the special rule does not apply unless the security is in fact traded for at least 10 of the 20 days.
