()-()If regarded, the $500x payment from FDE to P would result in FDE holding Asset A with a basis of $500x under section 1012. Accordingly, the tentative disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x. To determine FDE's adjusted disregarded basis with respect to Asset A under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, FDE's tentative disregarded basis is reduced by $30x (the disregarded cost recovery deduction with respect to Asset A), resulting in an adjusted disregarded basis of $470x.
