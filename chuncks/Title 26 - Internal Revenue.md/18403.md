###### ยง 1.381(c)(12)-1 Recovery of bad debts, prior taxes, or delinquency amounts.
####### Amount of recovery exclusion allowable for year of recovery.

(b)For the year of any recovery by the acquiring corporation, the amount of the recovery exclusion for the original taxable year shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of ยง 1.111-1. For the purpose of this paragraph and section 381(c)(12), the recovery exclusion for any year with respect to section 111 items of the acquiring corporation shall be kept separate from the recovery exclusion for any year with respect to section 111 items of each distributor or transferor corporation. The recovery by the acquiring corporation of any section 111 item of such corporation after the date of the distribution or transfer shall be considered separately from recoveries by the acquiring corporation of any such item which was deducted or credited by a distributor or transferor corporation. Any recovery by the acquiring corporation of a section 111 item shall be excluded from the gross income of the acquiring corporation to the extent of the recovery exclusion (1) determined for the original year for which that item was deducted or credited by the specific corporation which claimed the deduction or credit and (2) reduced by the excludable recoveries (whether made by the acquiring corporation, or by the distributor or transferor corporation) in intervening years with respect to the recovery exclusion of such corporation for such original year. There shall be taken into account the effect of net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks or capital loss carryovers.
