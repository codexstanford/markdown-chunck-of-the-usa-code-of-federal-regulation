####### Secretary's automatic approval.

(vi)The Secretary grants automatic approval to correct an administrative error or omission described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if-

(B) The administrative error or omission resulted in an allocation document (the Form 8609, "Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation Certification," or the allocation document under the requirements of section 42(h)(1)(E) or (F), and ยง 1.42-6(d)(2)) that either did not accurately reflect the number of buildings in a project (for example, an allocation document for a 10-building project only references 8 buildings instead of 10 buildings), or the correct information (other than the amount of credit allocated on the allocation document);

(C) The administrative error or omission does not affect the Agency's ranking of the building(s) or project and the total amount of credit the Agency allocated to the building(s) or project; and
