####### 3,Election to take aggregate section 481(a) adjustment for all joint operating agreements into account in the year of change,i,In general.,3,3,3

()-()A co-producer may elect to take into account its section 481(a) adjustment, computed on an aggregate basis for all of its JOAs, whether negative or positive, in the year of change, provided the co-producer uses the cumulative method for all of its JOAs entered into prior to its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year. The aggregate section 481(a) adjustment of a co-producer is equal to the difference between the amount of income reported under the co-producer's former method of accounting for all taxable years prior to the year of change and the amount of income that would have been reported if the co-producer's new method had been used in all of those taxable years for all JOAs for which the co-producer changes its method of accounting. An election made under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)() is irrevocable. If any person who, together with another person, would be treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1) (A) or (B) makes an election under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(), all persons within that single taxpayer group will be treated as if they had made an election under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)() and, as such, will be irrevocably bound by that election. If a co-producer does not make an election under this paragraph, each JOA entered into prior to the start of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year must be accounted for separately in computing the section 481(a) adjustment and taxable income of the co-producer for any year to which this paragraph (d) applies.
