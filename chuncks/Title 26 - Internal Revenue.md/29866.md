###### ยง 1.585-4 Reorganizations and asset acquisitions.
####### In general.

(a)In computing a reasonable addition to the reserve for losses on loans for the first taxable year ending after a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and for subsequent taxable years, the separate reserves for losses on loans, the amount of loans outstanding, the total bad debts sustained (adjusted for recoveries), and the amount of eligible loans outstanding of the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation (or, in the case of a consolidation, the transferor corporations) shall be combined for all applicable years. Thus, for example, in applying ยง 1.585-2(c)(1)(i) for the first taxable year ending after the distribution or transfer, the total bad debts sustained during the 5 preceding taxable years are the sum of the bad debts sustained by the acquiring corporation for the 5 preceding taxable years and bad debts sustained by the distributor or transferor corporation for the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and the 4 preceding taxable years.
