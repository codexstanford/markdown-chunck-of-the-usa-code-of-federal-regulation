() T's Year 2 and Year 3 are SRLYs with respect to the P group. See ยง 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's $50 net operating loss arising in Year 2 and $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 x 80 percent). Therefore, the P group can absorb up to $56 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4. Under the principles of section 172, T's $50 SRLY net operating loss from Year 2 is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 4. After absorption of this loss, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, $6 of SRLY limit remains in Year 4 ($56-$50). Further, the total amount of Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss carryovers under section 172(a) is $38 ($88-$50).
