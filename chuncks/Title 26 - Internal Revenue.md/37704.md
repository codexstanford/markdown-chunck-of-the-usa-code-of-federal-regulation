(c)-(1)The reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) is to be made whether the per-country limitation under section 904(a)(1) or the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) is used for the taxable year, but the reduction in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) must be made on a country-by-country basis before applying the limitation under section 904(a) to the reduced amount of taxes. If for the taxable year the separate limitation under section 904(f) applies to any foreign mineral income, that limitation must also be applied after making the reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
