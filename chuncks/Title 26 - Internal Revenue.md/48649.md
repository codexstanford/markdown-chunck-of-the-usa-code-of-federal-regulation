(2)-(i)If a QOF partner's basis in a qualifying QOF partnership interest is adjusted under section 1400Z-2(c) upon the disposition of a qualifying investment, then the basis of the QOF partnership interest is adjusted to an amount equal to the net fair market value of the interest, plus the QOF partner's share of QOF partnership indebtedness under section 752 with respect to that interest, and immediately prior to the sale or exchange, the bases of the assets of the QOF partnership and of any partnership owned directly or indirectly by the QOF partnership solely through one or more partnerships are also adjusted with respect to the disposed-of qualifying investment. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), section 7701(g) will apply in determining the value of a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership. The adjustments in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) are calculated in a manner similar to the section 743(b) adjustments that would have been made if the transferor QOF partner had purchased its interest in the QOF partnership for cash equal to the fair market value of the interest immediately prior to the sale or exchange, assuming that valid section 754 elections had been in place with respect to the QOF partnership and any partnerships directly or indirectly owned by the QOF partnership, whether or not an actual section 754 election is in place for any of the partnerships. This paragraph (b)(2)(i) applies without regard to the amount of deferred gain that was included under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) or the timing of that inclusion.
