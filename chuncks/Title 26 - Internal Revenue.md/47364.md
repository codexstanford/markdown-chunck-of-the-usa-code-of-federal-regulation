(b)If, pursuant to an election made by the taxpayer under section 1335 and paragraph (a) of ยง 1.1335-1, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year in which the taxpayer recovered property in respect of a war loss under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the unadjusted basis of such property shall be the fair market value of such property determined as of the date of the recovery, reduced by the amount of nonrecognized gain attributable to such recovery under the provisions of paragraph (b) of ยง 1.1333-1. However, if the property recovered is the same war loss property, and if the taxpayer under section 1333(1) includes such property in the amount of the recovery at its adjusted basis (for determining loss) in his hands on the date such property was considered under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as destroyed or seized, the unadjusted basis of such property shall be such adjusted basis, reduced by the amount of nonrecognized gain attributable to such recovery under the provisions of paragraph (b) of ยง 1.1333-1. The fair market value of any property recovered, or the adjusted basis for determining loss) of such property if the same property treated as war loss property is recovered, shall not be reduced in determining the unadjusted basis of such property by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to such property in respect of which the recovery was received, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under section 127(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property but such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied prior to the date of the recovery.
