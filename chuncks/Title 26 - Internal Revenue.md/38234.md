(B)The remittance of Asset A by FDE to P is a transfer of intangible property described in section 367(d)(4) from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner. The facts in paragraph (f)(4)(xii)(A) of this section do not implicate an exception in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)() or () of this section. Therefore, this is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)() of this section applies. The foreign branch is treated as having sold the transferred property to the foreign branch owner in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property, the amount of which for Year 2 is determined under the principles of section 367(d) to be $300x. Thus, in Year 2, P is treated as making a $300x disregarded payment to FDE. The payment would be allocable to general category U.S. source income under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section. Therefore, $300x of P's non-passive category U.S. source gross income is attributable to FDE under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section. P has $700x of general category U.S. source gross income and $300x of foreign branch category U.S. source gross income in Year 2.
