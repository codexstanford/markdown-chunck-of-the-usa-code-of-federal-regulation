####### Outstanding indebtedness.,indebtedness,substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness.

(6)For purposes of determining qualified indebtedness, the termhas the same meaning that it has under section 545(b)(7) and paragraph (g)(2) of ยง 1.545-2. Indebtedness ceases to be outstanding when the taxpayer no longer has an obligation absolute and not contingent with respect to the payment of such debt. An indebtedness evidenced by bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by a corporation is ordinarily incurred as of the date such obligations are issued, and the amount of such indebtedness is the amount represented by the face value of the obligations. However, a refunding, renewal, or mere change in the form of an indebtedness which does not involve a substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness will not have the effect of changing the date the indebtedness was incurred. (See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the meaning of) For purposes of this section, the outstanding indebtedness of a taxpayer includes a mortgage or other security interest on real estate of which such taxpayer is the legal or equitable owner (even though the taxpayer is not directly liable on the underlying evidence of indebtedness secured by such mortgage or security interest) provided such taxpayer shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that under all of the facts and circumstances it bears the burden of discharging such indebtedness. Thus, for example, if X acquires from Y property which is subject to a mortgage (X not assuming the indebtedness underlying such mortgage) and if X actually bears the burden of discharging the indebtedness, then, after the date of acquisition, such underlying indebtedness is outstanding indebtedness with respect to X, and, since Y's obligation to pay is in fact contingent upon X failing to discharge the indebtedness, such indebtedness is not outstanding indebtedness with respect to Y.
