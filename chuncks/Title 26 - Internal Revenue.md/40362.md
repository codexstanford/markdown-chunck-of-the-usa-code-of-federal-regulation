####### 2,Tested interest expense and tested interest income of FS2.

()FS2 has $300x of interest expense that is allocated and apportioned to its gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) and $400x of interest income that is included in gross tested income. However, a portion of FS2's interest income is excluded from foreign personal holding company income by reason of section 954(h), and a portion of FS2's assets are qualified assets. As a result, in determining the tested interest income and tested interest expense of FS2, the qualified interest income and qualified interest expense of FS2 are excluded. FS2 has qualified interest income of $300x, the amount of FS2's interest income that is excluded from foreign personal holding company income by reason of section 954(h). In addition, FS2 has qualified interest expense of $200x, the amount of FS2's interest expense that is allocated and apportioned to its gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) ($300x), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is FS2's average adjusted bases in qualified assets ($8,000x), and the denominator of which is FS2's average adjusted bases in all its assets ($12,000x). Accordingly, FS2 has tested interest income of $100x ($400x-$300x) and tested interest expense of $100x ($300x-$200x) for Year 1.
