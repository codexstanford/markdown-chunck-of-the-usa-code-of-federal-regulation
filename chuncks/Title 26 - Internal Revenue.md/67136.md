(b)-(1)Subject to the limitations of section 6416(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, tax paid under chapter 31 or 32 on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(A) if the article is exported by any person. Except in the case of articles subject to the tax imposed by section 4061(a), prior to April 1, 1983, it is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph (b), whether the person who made the taxable sale had knowledge at the time of the sale that the article or fuel was being purchased for export to a foreign country or shipment to a possession of the United States. See ยง 48.6416(e)-1 for the circumstances under which a claim for refund by reason of the exportation of an article may be claimed by the exporter or shipper, rather than by the person who paid the tax. For definition of the term "possession of the United States", see ยง 48.0-2(a)(11).
