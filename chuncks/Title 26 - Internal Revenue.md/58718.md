###### ยง 1.7704-2 Transition provisions.
####### Specific exceptions.

(2)In determining whether a partnership is an existing partnership for purposes of section 7704, the following events do not in themselves terminate the status of existing partnerships-

(i) Termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) due to the sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interests in partnership capital and profits;

(ii) Issuance of additional partnership units; and

(iii) Dropping a line of business. This event, however, could affect an existing partnership's status indirectly. For example, dropping one line of business could change the composition of the partnership's gross income. The change in composition could make a new line of business "substantial," under paragraph (c) of this section, and terminate the partnership's status. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
