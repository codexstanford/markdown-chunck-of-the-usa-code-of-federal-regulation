####### Reason to know regarding an entity's chapter 4 status.

(i)A withholding agent has reason to know that a withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence provided by or on behalf of an entity is unreliable or incorrect if there is information on the face of the documentation or in the withholding agent's account files that conflicts with the entity's claim regarding its chapter 4 status. For example, a withholding agent has reason to know that an entity's claim that it is an excepted NFFE is unreliable or incorrect if the withholding agent has obtained a financial statement or credit report for AML purposes that indicates that the entity is engaged in business as a financial institution. See also paragraph (e)(4) of this section for the 30-day period before a withholding agent has reason to know a claim is unreliable or incorrect based on AML information. Further, a withholding agent that has classified an entity as engaged in a particular type of business based on its records, such as through the use of a standardized industry coding system, AML or other regulatory purpose that requires the withholding agent to periodically monitor and periodically update the business classification based on the withholding agent's records, the withholding agent has reason to know that the chapter 4 status claimed by the entity is unreliable or incorrect only if the entity's claim conflicts with the withholding agent's classification of the entity's business type.
