###### ยง 1.401(a)-4 Optional forms of benefit (before 1994).
####### Limitation on transitional alternatives.

(d)The transitional alternatives permitting the elimination or reduction of optional forms of benefit will not violate section 411(d)(6) during the period prior to the applicable effective date for the plan (see Q&A-6 of this section). After the applicable effective date, any amendment (other than one described in paragraph (c)(2) of this Q&A-5) that eliminates or reduces an optional form of benefit or imposes new objective criteria restricting the availability of such optional form of benefit will fail to qualify for the exception to section 411(d)(6) provided in this Q&A-5. This is the case without regard to whether the availability of the optional form of benefit is discriminatory or may reasonably be expected to be discriminatory.

Q-6: For what period are the rules of this section effective?
