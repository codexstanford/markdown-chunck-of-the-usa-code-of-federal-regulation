() Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each loss carryover and built-in loss. In the P group, P's $50 loss carryover is not treated as arising in a SRLY. See ยง 1.1502-1(f). Consequently, the carryover is not subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section in the P group.
