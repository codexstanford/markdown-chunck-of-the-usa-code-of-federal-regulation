####### Result.,1

(B)() Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2), the Transaction is a CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), the Pre-Transaction Assets are RFAs with respect to both Country F tax and Country G tax, because they are relevant in determining the foreign income of DE1 for Country F tax and Country G tax purposes and were owned by DE1 when the Transaction occurred. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), USP is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to the RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), DE1 is a foreign payor for Country F tax and Country G tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), USP is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which DE1 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(4)(ii)). Because the Country G foreign income tax amount is claimed as a credit for purposes of determining the Country F foreign income tax amount, the Country G foreign income tax amount is an FCCT under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(22).
