####### Example 7,modified portfolio contract

(4) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and that change is intended to compensate one or more parties for a change in rights or obligations that are not derived from the contract being modified. See paragraph (j)(6)(vii) of this section (). If each contract in a given portfolio of contracts has the same parties, those parties modify more than one contract in the portfolio (each such contract is a), and those modifications provide for a single, aggregate qualified one-time payment with respect to all modified portfolio contracts, then the portion of the qualified one-time payment allocable to any one modified portfolio contract is treated for purposes of this paragraph (j)(4) as not intended to compensate for a change in rights or obligations derived from any other modified portfolio contract.

(5) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and the modification is identified for purposes of this paragraph (j)(5) in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see ยง 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(a) of this chapter) as having a principal purpose of achieving a result that is unreasonable in light of the purpose of this section.
