() The sponsoring entity has not had its status as a sponsor revoked.

(E) The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status as a sponsoring entity with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs based on the provisions of paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section (describing notice of event of default, remediation, and termination procedures) if there is an event of default as defined in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. A sponsoring entity is not liable for any failure to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D) of this section unless the sponsoring entity is a withholding agent that is separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. A sponsored FFI will remain liable for any failure of its sponsoring entity to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D) of this section that the sponsoring entity has agreed to undertake on behalf of the FFI, even if the sponsoring entity is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.
