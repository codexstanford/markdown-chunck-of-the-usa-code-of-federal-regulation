####### Determination of status.

(c)The conditions described in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of paragraph (b) of this section must be met during the entire taxable year and the condition described in subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of this section must exist during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. The days during which the latter condition must exist need not be consecutive. In determining the minimum number of days during which the condition described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section is required to exist in a taxable year of less than 12 months, fractional days shall be disregarded. For example, in a taxable year of 310 days, the actual number of days prescribed would be 284days (of 335). The fractional day is disregarded so that the required condition in such taxable year need exist for only 284 days.
