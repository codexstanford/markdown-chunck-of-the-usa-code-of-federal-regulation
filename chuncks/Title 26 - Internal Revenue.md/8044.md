####### Example 5: ATI calculation with passive activity loss,Facts.

(5)-(i)D is an individual who engages in a trade or business, V, as a sole proprietorship. D relies on employees to perform most of the work and, as a result, D does not materially participate in V. Therefore, V is a passive activity of D. V is not an excepted trade or business. In Year 1, V generates $500x of passive income, $400x of business interest expense, and $600x of ordinary and necessary expenses deductible under section 162 (not including any interest described in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(22)). No disallowed business interest expense carryforward has been carried to Year 1 from a prior year, and no amounts have been carried over to Year 1 from a prior year under either section 465(a)(2) or section 469(b).
