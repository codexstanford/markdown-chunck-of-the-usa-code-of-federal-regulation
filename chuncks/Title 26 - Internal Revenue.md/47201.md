() Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $600x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's income ($1,200x) multiplied by 50% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $600x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,200x); and $1,000x, which is F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2 that are treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2, $1,000x is treated as non-passive, and $200x is treated as passive.
