####### Percentage of financial support.

(A)The percentage of support received by an organization from public or governmental sources will be taken into consideration in determining whether an organization is "publicly supported." The higher the percentage of support above the 10 percent requirement of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from public or governmental sources, the lesser will be the burden of establishing the publicly supported nature of the organization through other factors, including those described in this paragraph (f)(3), while the lower the percentage, the greater will be the burden. If the percentage of the organization's support from public or governmental sources is low because it receives a high percentage of its total support from investment income on its endowment funds, such fact will be treated as evidence of an organization being "publicly supported" if such endowment funds were originally contributed by a governmental unit or by the general public. However, if such endowment funds were originally contributed by a few individuals or members of their families, such fact will increase the burden on the organization of establishing that it is "publicly supported" taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances, including the other factors described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
