######## Taxable period.

(4)For purposes of section 6621(c) and this section, the "taxable period" is the taxable year in the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of any other tax, the "taxable period" is the period to which the underpayment relates. For example, the taxable period for an underpayment of FICA taxes is the calendar quarter. If the underpayment does not relate to a particular period (for example, in the case of certain transactional excise taxes), the "taxable period" is the period covered by a return on which the tax is required to be shown.
