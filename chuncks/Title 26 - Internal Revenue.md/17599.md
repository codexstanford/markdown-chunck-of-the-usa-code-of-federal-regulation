(B)Because DC failed to file a GRA with its timely filed tax return for the year of the FS2 Transfer, there is a failure to timely file the GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. DC's course of conduct is taken into account in determining whether its failure to timely file a GRA for the FS2 Transfer was willful. Based on the facts of in paragraph (p)(3)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts of this), including DC's history of failing to file required tax and information returns in general and GRAs in particular, and its failure to implement safeguards to ensure that it would timely file GRAs, the failure to timely file a GRA with respect to the FS2 Transfer rises to the level of a willful failure to timely file. Accordingly, DC is ineligible for relief under paragraph (p) of this section, the GRA is not considered timely filed for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC must recognize the full amount of the gain realized on the FS2 Transfer.
