####### Property distributed by a partnership.

(2)Section 735(a), relating to the character of gain or loss on disposition of property distributed by a partnership to a partner, shall apply only to property distributed after March 9, 1954. Although a partnership whose taxable year begins before January 1, 1955, generally will be subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, any unrealized receivables or inventory items distributed by any such partnership after March 9, 1954, will be subject to the provisions of section 735(a), and the gain or loss on the subsequent disposition of such property will be ordinary gain or loss rather than capital gain or loss. In the case of property distributed before March 10, 1954, section 735(a) will not apply, even though the property is disposed of by the distributee partner after that date, unless the partnership elects under paragraph (c) of this section to apply section 735.
