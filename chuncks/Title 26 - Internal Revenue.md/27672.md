###### ยง 1.482-7 Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a cost sharing arrangement.
####### Discount rates appropriate to cost sharing and licensing alternatives.,1

(F)The present value of the cost sharing and licensing alternatives, respectively, should be determined using the appropriate discount rates in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(v) and (g)(4)(vi)(F) of this section. See, for example, ยง 1.482-7(g)(2)(v)(B)() (Discount rate variation between realistic alternatives). In circumstances where the market-correlated risks as between the cost sharing and licensing alternatives are not materially different, a reliable analysis may be possible by using the same discount rate with respect to both alternatives.
