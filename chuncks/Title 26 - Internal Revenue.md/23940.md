(4)-(i)If, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, or a plan amendment takes effect, during the plan year because the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) or (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, then the presumed adjusted funding target must be adjusted to reflect any increase in the funding target attributable to the unpredictable contingent event benefits or the plan amendment and the interim value of plan assets must be increased by the present value of the contribution. Similarly, if benefit accruals are permitted to resume in a plan year because the plan sponsor makes the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, then the presumed adjusted funding target must be adjusted to reflect any increase in the funding target attributable to the benefit accruals for the prior plan year and the interim value of adjusted plan assets must be increased by the present value of the contribution. The adjustment to the presumed adjusted funding target is made as of the date of the contribution, and that date is a section 436 measurement date.
