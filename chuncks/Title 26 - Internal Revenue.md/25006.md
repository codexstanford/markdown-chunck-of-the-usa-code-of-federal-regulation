####### Analysis.

(B)A includes $0 in gross income in 2023. A's cost of goods in progress offset for 2023 is $20x under paragraph (e)(4) of this section ($30x costs of goods through the last day of 2023 ($10x for 2022 plus $20x for 2023 = $30x) less $10x cumulative cost of goods in progress offset amounts taken in prior taxable years). However, because A's advance payment inventory inclusion amount for 2023 is $0, which is the amount of the advance payment that, but for the cost of goods in progress offset, would be includable in gross income in 2023 under the deferral method, paragraph (e)(5) of this section limits the cost offset to $0.
