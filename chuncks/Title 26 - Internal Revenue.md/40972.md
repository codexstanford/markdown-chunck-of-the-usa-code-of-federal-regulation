However, the fact that property acquired by a controlled foreign corporation has not been held on an applicable determination date for more than 6 months after the date of its acquisition shall not prevent such property from being included in the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries on such date. Proper adjustments shall be made subsequently, however, to exclude any item of property so included, if the property is in fact disposed of within 6 months after the date of its acquisition. See section 955(b)(4).
