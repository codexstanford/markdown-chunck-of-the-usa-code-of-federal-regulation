####### 3,Apportionment based on gross receipts.

()Although X has gross intangible income of $200,000x from domestic sales and $50,000x as a PCT Payment from Y, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, because of the cost sharing arrangement, Y's gross receipts from sales are not taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures that are intangible development costs with respect to the cost sharing arrangement. Because all of the gross receipts from sales that are taken into account under paragraph (d)(1) of this section relate to gross intangible income that is included in the residual grouping, $35,000x is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.
