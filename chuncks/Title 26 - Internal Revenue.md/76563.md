######## More than $2000 of fees.

(4)The owner of oil who is liable for more than $2000 of fees for any month of a calendar quarter must deposit fees for the following quarter (regardless of amount) on a semimonthly basis. The deposit must be made on or before the ninth day following the semimonthly period for which it is reportable. The first deposit for a month may be reasonably estimated when an accounting of oil production is normally done by the month. Under these circumstances, the second for that month deposit should be adjusted to reflect the total barrels produced in that month.
