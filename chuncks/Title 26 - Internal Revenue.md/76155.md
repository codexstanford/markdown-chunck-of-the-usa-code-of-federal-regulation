(4)The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (c), are applicable to taxable years ending after October 31, 1964. However, at the option of the taxpayer, for a taxable year beginning before November 1, 1964, and ending after October 31, 1964, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (except the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (iv)() of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c)) shall apply only to the part year falling after October 31, 1964, as if such part year constituted a taxable year. In such case, the following rules shall apply:

(i) The amount of the "loans acquired for investment" for such part year shall be equal to the loans acquired for investment during the entire taxable year within which falls such part year, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such part year and the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire taxable year.

(ii) The increase in sales of whole loans and participations permitted by subdivision (vi) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), (relating to carryover of sales and use of preceding year's base) shall be the amount of such increase computed under such subdivision, multiplied by the fraction specified in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
