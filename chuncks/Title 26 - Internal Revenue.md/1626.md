####### Retrofitted qualified facility or carbon capture equipment (80/20 Rule).

(5)A qualified facility or carbon capture equipment may qualify as originally placed in service even if it contains some used components of property, provided the fair market value of the used components of property is not more than 20 percent of the qualified facility or carbon capture equipment's total value (that is, the cost of the new components of property plus the value of the used components of property) (80/20 Rule). In determining the value of the used components of property as compared to the new components, the general principles of Revenue Ruling 94-31 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(i)(a) and (ii) of this chapter), will apply. The relevant unit of retrofitted carbon capture equipment for purposes of the 80/20 Rule is an independently functioning process train. For purposes of the 80/20 Rule, the cost of a new qualified facility or carbon capture equipment includes all properly capitalized costs of the new qualified facility or carbon capture equipment. Solely for purposes of the 80/20 Rule, properly capitalized costs of a new qualified facility or carbon capture equipment may, at the option of the taxpayer, include the cost of new equipment for a pipeline (the cost of equipment for a new pipeline, not equipment used to repair an existing pipeline) owned and used exclusively by that taxpayer to transport carbon oxides captured by that taxpayer's qualified facility or carbon capture equipment that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere.
