###### In General
####### ยง 301.6231(c)-1 Special rules for certain applications for tentative carryback and refund adjustments based on partnership losses, deductions, or credits.
######## Application subject to this section.

(a)This section applies in the case of an application under section 6411 (relating to tentative carryback and refund adjustments) based on losses, deductions, or credits of a partnership if the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, determines, after review of the available relevant information, that it is highly likely that a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect to the partnership-

(1) A gross valuation overstatement; or

(2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership that would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only with respect to an application based upon the original reporting on the partner's income tax return of partnership losses, deductions, or credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request for administrative adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative adjustment).
