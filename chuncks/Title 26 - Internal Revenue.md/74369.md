(a)If the Secretary or his delegate determines pursuant to paragraph (c) of ยง 301.6363-1 that a State did not file a valid notice of election or does not have a tax which would meet the requirements for qualification specified in section 6362 and the regulations thereunder if a State agreement were in effect with respect thereto, or if he determines pursuant to paragraph (b) of ยง 301.6363-2 that a participating State has enacted a law as a result of which the State no longer has a qualified tax, such State may, within 60 days after its Governor has received notification of such determination, file a petition for the review of such determination with either the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the State is located or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If a State files such a petition, the clerk of the court shall forthwith transmit a copy of the petition to the Secretary or his delegate, who in turn shall thereupon file in the court the record of proceedings on which the determination adverse to the State was based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code.
