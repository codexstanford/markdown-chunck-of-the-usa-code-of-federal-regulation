###### ยง 1.6050H-1 Information reporting of mortgage interest received in a trade or business from an individual.
####### Interest received or collected on behalf of another person,General rule.

(2)-(i)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section, a person that, in the course of its trade or business, receives or collects interest on a mortgage on behalf of another person (e.g., the lender of record) is the interest recipient (the initial recipient) for the mortgage. In this case, the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the transfer of interest from the initial recipient to the person for which the initial recipient receives or collects the interest. For example, if financial institution A collects interest on behalf of financial institution B, A is the initial recipient for the mortgage and is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6050H, and B is not required to report the interest received on the mortgage from A.
