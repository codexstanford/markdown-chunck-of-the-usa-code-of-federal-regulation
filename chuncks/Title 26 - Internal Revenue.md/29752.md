####### b) Special rule.

(Section 562(b)(1)(B) provides that in the case of a complete liquidation occurring within 24 months after the adoption of a plan of liquidation the amount of the deduction is equal to the earnings and profits for each taxable year in which distributions are made. Thus, if there is a distribution in liquidation pursuant to section 333, or a distribution in complete liquidation pursuant to section 331(a)(1) or 332 which occurs within a 24-month period after the adoption of a plan of liquidation, a dividends paid deduction will be allowable to the extent of the current earnings and profits for the taxable year or years even though there was a deficit in earnings and profits on the first day of such taxable year or years. In computing the earnings and profits for the taxable year in which the distributions are made, computation shall be made with the inclusion of capital gains and without any deduction for capital losses.
