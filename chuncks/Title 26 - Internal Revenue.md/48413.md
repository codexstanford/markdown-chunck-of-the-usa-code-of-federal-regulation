()Taxpayer owns 100 shares of publicly traded Company X common stock and acquires put options on 100 shares of Company X common stock during the taxable year. Taxpayer does not make any straddle identifications under section 1092. During the taxable year, Taxpayer sells all 100 shares of its Company X common stock and has a $40 capital gain. During the taxable year, Taxpayer also closes out all of its put options on Company X common stock and has a $30 capital loss. That $40 of capital gain is from a position that was part of a straddle during the taxable year because the position in Company X common stock and the position in put options on Company X stock are offsetting positions as defined in section 1092(c). Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section, none of Taxpayer's $40 of capital gain is eligible gain.
