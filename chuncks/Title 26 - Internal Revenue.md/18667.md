####### Rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.

(vi)The rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section do not apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992. The rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section applies to the lapse or forfeiture of any option treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. If an option is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, and the option is actually exercised on a day that is within 120 days after the date on which the option is treated as exercised, the rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) of this section applies (even if the actual exercise of the option occurs on a date on which the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section would not otherwise apply). Thus, in such a case, the loss corporation may elect to treat paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (vi)(A) of this section as not applying to the option and take into account only the acquisition of loss corporation stock resulting from the actual exercise of the option.
