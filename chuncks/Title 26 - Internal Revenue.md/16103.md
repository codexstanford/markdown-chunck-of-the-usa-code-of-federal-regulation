####### Time and amount of liabilities.

(2)The time for taking into account liabilities of old Target in determining ADADP and the amount of the liabilities taken into account is determined as if old Target had sold its assets to an unrelated person for consideration that included the discharge of the liabilities by the unrelated person. For example, if no amount of a Target liability is properly taken into account in amount realized as of the beginning of the day after the disposition date, the liability is not initially taken into account in determining ADADP, but it may be taken into account at some later date.
