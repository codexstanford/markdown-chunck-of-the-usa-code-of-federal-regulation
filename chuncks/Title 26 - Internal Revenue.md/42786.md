####### 2,Definition of notional principal contract.,e.g.,,e.g.,

()The term "notional principal contract" means a contract (a swap, cap, floor or collar) that provides for the payment of amounts by one party to another at specified intervals calculated by reference to a specified index upon a notional principal amount in exchange for specified consideration or a promise to pay similar amounts. For this purpose, a "notional principal contract" shall only include an instrument where the underlying property to which the instrument ultimately relates is money (functional currency), nonfunctional currency, or property the value of which is determined by reference to an interest rate. Thus, the term "notional principal contract" includes a currency swap as defined in ยง 1.988-2(e)(2)(ii), but does not include a swap referenced to a commodity or equity index.
