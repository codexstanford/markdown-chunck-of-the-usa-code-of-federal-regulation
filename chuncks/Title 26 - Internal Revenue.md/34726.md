####### Facts.

(A)X is a domestic corporation that operates B, a branch doing business in a foreign country. B is a section 987 QBU (as defined in ยง 1.987-1(b)(2)) as well as a foreign branch (as defined in ยง 1.904-4(f)(3)(iii)). In 2020, without regard to B, X has gross domestic source income of $1,000x and gross foreign source general category income of $500x and incurs $200 of interest expense. Using the tax book value method of apportionment, X, without regard to B, determines the value of its assets that generate domestic source income to be $6,000x and the value of its assets that generate foreign source general category income to be $1,000x. Applying the translation rules of section 987, X (through B) earned $500 of gross foreign source foreign branch category income and incurred $100x of interest expense. B incurred no other expenses. For 2020, the average functional currency book value of B's assets that generate foreign source foreign branch category income translated at the year-end rate for 2020 is $3,000x.
