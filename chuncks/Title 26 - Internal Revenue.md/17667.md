###### ยง 1.367(a)-8 Gain recognition agreement requirements.
####### Example 20. Intercompany transaction followed by disposition to nonmember,Facts.

(xx)-(A)At the time of the initial transfer, the TFD stock has a $50x basis and $100x fair market value. The amount of the gain recognition agreement is $50x. In year 3, UST distributes all of the TFC stock to USP in a transaction to which section 301 applies. At the time of the distribution, the TFC stock has a $50x basis and $90x fair market value. Under section 311(b), UST must recognize $40x gain (the intercompany item) on the distribution, but because the distribution is an intercompany transaction, under the provisions of ยง 1.1502-13, the $40x gain is not taken into account in year 3. In year 4, USP sells all of the TFC stock to X, an unrelated corporation. Under the provisions of ยง 1.1502-13, in year 4 UST takes into account the $40x intercompany item as a result of the sale of the TFC stock to X.
