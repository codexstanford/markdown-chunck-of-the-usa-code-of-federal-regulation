##### Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses
###### ยง 1.1251-1 General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of property used in farming where farm losses offset nonfarm income.
####### Relation of section 1251 to other provisions,General.

(e)-(1)The provisions of section 1251 apply (after applying paragraph (b)(5) of this section, relating to section 1245 property) notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or special rule under section 1251(d) and ยง 1.1251-4 applies, gain under section 1251(c)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, section 1251 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in a trade or business). Accordingly, gain recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the balance in the taxpayer's excess deductions account, and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (3) of paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
