Various exceptions and safe harbors are provided. Paragraph (f) of this section provides certain safe harbors for employers who inadvertently fail to deposit the full amount of taxes. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides an overriding exception to the Monthly and Semi-Weekly rules where an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the definition of employment taxes.
