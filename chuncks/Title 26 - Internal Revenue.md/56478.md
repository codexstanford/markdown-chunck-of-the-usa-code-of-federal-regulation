###### ยง 1.6045-4 Information reporting on real estate transactions with dates of closing on or after January 1, 1991.
####### Exception for certain exempt transactions,Certain transfers.

(c)-(1)No return of information is required with respect to-

(i) A transaction that is not a sale or exchange (such as a gift (including a transaction treated as a gift under section 1041) or bequest, or a financing or refinancing that is not related to the acquisition of reportable real estate), even if the transaction involves reportable real estate, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(ii) A transfer in full or partial satisfaction of any indebtedness secured by the property so transferred including a foreclosure, a transfer in lieu of foreclosure or an abandonment; or

(iii) A transaction (a "de minimis transfer") in which it can be determined with certainty that the total consideration (in money, services and property), received or to be received in connection with the transaction is less than $600 in value (determined without regard to any allocation of gross proceeds among multiple transferors under paragraph (i)(5) of this section) as of the date of the closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section), even if the transaction involves reportable real estate. Thus, for example, if a contract for sale of reportable real estate recites total consideration of "$1.00 plus other valuable consideration," the transfer is not a de minimis transfer unless the reporting person can determine that the "other valuable consideration" received or to be received is less than $599 in value as measured on the date of closing.
