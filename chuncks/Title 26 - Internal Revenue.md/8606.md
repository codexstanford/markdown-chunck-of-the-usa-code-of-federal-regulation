(B)If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of the last sentence of this paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B), the taxpayer may allocate asset basis for a taxable year based on the average of adjusted asset basis at the beginning of the year and the end of the year (annual determination method). For these purposes, the termmeans the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, and the termhas the same meaning as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section. A taxpayer may use the annual determination method for a taxable year only if the taxpayer demonstrates that its total adjusted basis (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section) at the end of the year in its assets used in its excepted trades or businesses, as a percentage of the taxpayer's total adjusted basis at the end of such year in all of its assets used in a trade or business, does not differ by more than 20 percent from such percentage at the beginning of the year.
