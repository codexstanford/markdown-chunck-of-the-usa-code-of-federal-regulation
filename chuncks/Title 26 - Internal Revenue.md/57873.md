###### ยง 1.6411-3 Allowance of adjustments.
####### Disallowance in whole or in part.

(c)If the Commissioner finds that an application for a tentative carryback adjustment contains material omissions or errors of computation, the Commissioner may disallow the application in whole or in part without further action. If the Commissioner deems that any error of computation can be corrected within the 90-day period, the Commissioner may do so and allow the application in whole or in part. The Commissioner's determination as to whether the Commissioner can correct any error of computation within the 90-day period shall be conclusive. The Commissioner's action in disallowing, in whole or in part, any application for a tentative carryback adjustment shall be final and may not be challenged in any proceeding. The taxpayer may, however, file a claim for credit or refund under section 6402, and may maintain a suit based on the claim if the claim is disallowed or if the Commissioner does not act upon the claim within 6 months from the date it is filed.
