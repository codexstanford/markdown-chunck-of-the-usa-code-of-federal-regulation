(2)The Internal Revenue Service will accept a power of attorney other than form 2848 provided such document satisfies the requirements of ยง 601.503(a). However, for purposes of processing such documents onto the Centralized Authorization File (see ยง 601.506(d)), a completed form 2848 must be attached. (In such situations, form 2848 is not the operative power of attorney and need not be signed by the taxpayer. However, the Declaration of Representative must be signed by the representative.)
