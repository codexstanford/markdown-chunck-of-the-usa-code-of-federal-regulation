(B)As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (), the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of L's debt instrument. However, B's obligation to pay the consent fee is also a modification of L's debt instrument but is not a covered modification because it is not described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. In particular, B's obligation to pay the consent fee is not an associated modification because it is not a modification of the technical, administrative, or operational terms of L's debt instrument and is not intended to compensate for valuation differences resulting from a modification of the administrative terms of L's contract. Nor is the consent fee a qualified one-time payment because it is not intended to compensate L for any part of the basis difference between the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (six-month USD LIBOR) and the interest rate benchmark to which the qualified rate refers (six-month CME Term SOFR). See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
