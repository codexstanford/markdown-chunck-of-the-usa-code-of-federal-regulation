####### Result.

(ii)Pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-1(b)(4)(ii), the interest in DE1, the interest in DE2, FB, P's share of the Country X business operations carried on by PRS (which is owned by P indirectly through its interest in PRS), and DRC's Country X business operations are combined and treated as a single separate unit of the consolidated group of which P is the parent. This is the case regardless of whether the losses of each individual separate unit are made available to offset the income of the other individual separate units under Country X tax laws. Because DRCis a dual resident corporation, it is not combined and treated as part of this combined separate unit and, as a result, DRC's income or dual consolidated loss is not taken into account in determining the income or dual consolidated loss of the combined separate unit. In addition, P's interest in DE3is not combined and is another separate unit because it is subject to tax in Country Y, rather than Country X.
