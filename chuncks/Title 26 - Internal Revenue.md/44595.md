####### Capital Interest Allocations made by a Passthrough Entity that is an API Holder.

(5)An allocation made to a Passthrough Entity that holds an API in a lower-tier Passthrough Entity will be considered a Capital Interest Allocation if it meets the principles set forth in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section (other than paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section). For purposes of applying the Capital Interest Allocation rules in this paragraph (c)(5) to a tiered partnership structure, to the extent that a Capital Interest Allocation that is made by a lower-tier partnership to an upper-tier partnership is properly allocated to the upper-tier partnership's partners with respect to their capital interests in the upper-tier partnership in a manner that is respected under 704(b) (taking into account the principles of section 704(c)), such allocation is a Capital Interest Allocation.
