###### ยง 1.1061-5 Section 1061(d) transfers to related persons.
####### Example 1: Transfer to child by gift.

(1)A, an individual, performs services in an ATB and has held an API in connection with those services for 10 years. The API has a fair market value of $1,000 and a tax basis of $0, and no debt is associated with the API. A transfers all of the API to A's daughter as a gift. A's daughter is a section 1061(d) Related Person but A's gift is not a transfer as described in paragraph (b) of this section thus section 1061(d) does not apply to A's gift. However, the API remains an API in the hands of A's daughter under ยง 1.1061-2(a)(1)(i).
