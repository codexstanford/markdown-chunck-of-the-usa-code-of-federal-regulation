(6)-(i)The Commissioner may grant waivers of the requirements of this section in cases of undue hardship. One principal factor in determining hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing the return electronically in accordance with this section exceeds the cost of filing the return on paper. A request for a waiver must be made in accordance with applicable IRS revenue procedures, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, including postings to thewebsite. The waiver request will specify the type of filing (that is, a return required under paragraph (b) of this section) and the period to which it applies. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a waiver granted for a return under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) will be deemed to have waived the electronic-filing requirement for any returns required to be filed under section 6050I.
