####### Taxable and nontaxable articles sold as a unit.

(e)Where a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. For example, where a fishing reel (an article subject to tax under section 4161(a)) is equipped with a fishing line (a nontaxable article) and the reel and line are sold as a unit, the tax imposed by section 4161(a) applies only to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the fishing reel. Normally, the taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer. Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.
