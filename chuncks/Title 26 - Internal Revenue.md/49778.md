####### Withholding foreign trusts.

(v)The IRS may enter into a withholding agreement with a foreign trust to treat the trust or estate as a withholding foreign trust. Such a withholding agreement shall generally follow the same principles as a withholding agreement with a withholding foreign partnership under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. A withholding agent may treat a payment to a withholding foreign trust in the same manner the withholding agent would treat a payment (including a withholdable payment) to a withholding foreign partnership. See ยง 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D). For a withholding foreign trust that is an FFI, the withholding agreement will require the withholding foreign trust to assume the requirements of either a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA that is subject to due diligence and reporting requirements with respect to its U.S. accounts similar to those applicable to a registered deemed-compliant FFI under ยง 1.1471-5(f)(1).
