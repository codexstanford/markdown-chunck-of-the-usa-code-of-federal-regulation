####### Special rule for applying "4 percent" gross receipts method to sales.,b,c,d,c,d,i.e.,

(ii)A transfer price or commission, determined under the "4 percent" gross receipts method (determined without regard to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph), for a sale of export property referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will not be considered to cause a loss for the related supplier if for the DISC's taxable year, the ratio that (a) the taxable income of the DISC derived from such sale by using such price or commission bears to () the DISC's gross receipts from such sale is not greater than the ratio that () all of the taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC from all sales of the same product or product line (domestic and foreign) to third parties whether or not related parties bears to () the total gross receipts of the related supplier and the DISC from such sales. For purposes of the preceding sentence, sales between the DISC and its related suppliers shall not be taken into account under () or () of this subdivision. For example, assume that for a taxable year of a DISC the total costs of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to all sales ($150 for domestic and $44 for foreign) of a product line are $194 and the total gross receipts of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to such sales are $200 so that the total taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to such sales is $6. The parties would thus be entitled to compute a transfer price determined under the gross receipts method on any given sale of product A of such product line by the related supplier to the DISC which would allocate to the DISC taxable income equal to not more than 3 percent ($6/$200) of its gross receipts derived from its resale of such product. If the DISC were to resell an item of product A for $10, the transfer price paid by the DISC to the related supplier determined under the gross receipts method could be as low as $9.70.
