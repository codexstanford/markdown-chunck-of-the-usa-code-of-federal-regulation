####### Subsidiary corporations.

(i)The provisions of section 514(f), (g), and (h) are applicable whether or not a subsidiary corporation of the type described in section 501(c)(2) is availed of in making the business lease. For example, assume a parent organization borrows funds to purchase realty and sets up a separate section 501(c)(2) corporation as a subsidiary to hold the property. Such subsidiary corporation leases the property for a period of more than 5 years, collects the rents and pays over all of the income, less expenses, to the parent organization, the parent organization being liable for the indebtedness. Under these assumed facts, the lease by section 501(c)(2) subsidiary corporation would be a business lease with respect to such subsidiary corporation, and the rental income would be subject to the tax, whether or not the subsidiary itself assumes the indebtedness and whether or not the property is subject to the indebtedness.
