(xvi)-(A)UST wholly owns F1 and TFD. The F1 stock has a $100x basis and $90x fair market value, and the TFD stock has a $0x basis and $100x fair market value. UST also owns real property with a $10x basis and $10x fair market value. In year 1, pursuant to a section 351 exchange, UST transfers the real property, the TFD stock, and the F1 stock to TFC in exchange solely for 20 shares of TFC stock. UST enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer of the TFD stock. The amount of the gain recognition agreement is $100x. UST takes the position that the basis of each share of TFC stock received in the exchange is $5.5x (a proportionate amount of the $110x aggregate basis of the transferred property). In year 3, UST disposes of all its TFC stock in a transaction in which all gain realized is recognized and included in taxable income.
