####### Effect of characterization.

(4)If a noncompensatory option is treated as a partnership interest under this section or under general principles of law, the option holder will be treated as a partner with respect to the partnership interest and will receive a distributive share of the partnership's income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or items thereof), as determined in accordance with that partner's interest in the partnership (taking into account all facts and circumstances) in accordance with ยง 1.704-1(b)(3). Once a noncompensatory option is treated as a partnership interest, in no event may it be characterized as an option thereafter.
