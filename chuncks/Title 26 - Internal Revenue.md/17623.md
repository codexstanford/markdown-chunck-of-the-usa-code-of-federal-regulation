() Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the transfer of the TFC stock by UST to FA is a triggering event with respect to the gain recognition agreement for the initial transfer. The exception provided by paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section does not apply to such transfer because FA, the acquiring corporation in the asset reorganization, is foreign. However, the transfer shall not constitute a triggering event if the conditions of the exception provided by paragraph (k)(14) of this section are satisfied.
