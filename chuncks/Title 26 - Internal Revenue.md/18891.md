###### ยง 1.382-9 Special rules under section 382 for corporations under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case.
####### Operating rules.

(ii)For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section: (A) If a loss corporation has actual knowledge of a coordinated acquisition of its indebtedness by a group of persons, through a formal or informal understanding among themselves, for a principal purpose of exchanging the indebtedness for stock, the indebtedness (and any stock received in exchange therefor) is treated as owned by an entity. A principal element in determining if an understanding exists among members of a group is whether the investment decision of each member is based upon the investment decision of one or more other members.

(B) If the loss corporation has actual knowledge regarding stock ownership described in ยง 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must take that ownership into account in determining which beneficial owners of indebtedness are, immediately after the ownership change, 5-percent shareholders or 5-percent entities. The loss corporation is not required to take into account an ownership interest described in ยง 1.382-2T(k)(4) unless the loss corporation has actual knowledge of the ownership interest.
