###### ยง 1.861-9 Allocation and apportionment of interest expense and rules for asset-based apportionment.
####### Computation of intangible asset value.

(D)Pursuant to ยง 1.861-9T(h)(1)(iii), the value of the intangible assets of USP, CFC1, and CFC2 is $0 (total aggregate group asset value ($1100) determined in paragraph (B) less total tangible asset value ($1100) determined in paragraph (C)). Because the intangible asset value is zero, the provisions of ยง 1.861-9T(h)(2) and (3) relating to the apportionment and characterization of intangible assets do not apply.
