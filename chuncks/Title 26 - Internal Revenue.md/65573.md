() Any excess of a deposit over the actual taxes required to be deposited to date (overdeposit) during the return period shall be applied in order of time to each of the employer's succeeding deposit obligations within the same return period. In the determination of the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in succeeding deposit periods, the overdeposit does not reduce the aggregate amount accumulated although the overdeposit is credited to the depositor's account.
