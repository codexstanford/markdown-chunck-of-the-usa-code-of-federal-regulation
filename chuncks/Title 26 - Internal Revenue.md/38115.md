###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Example 12.

(xii)In Year 1, USP, a domestic corporation, earns a $100x dividend that is foreign source passive income subject to a 30% withholding tax. The dividend is not paid by a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation (as defined in section 245A(b)(1)). A foreign tax credit for the withholding tax on the dividend is disallowed under section 901(k). A deduction for the tax is allowed, however, under sections 164 and 901(k)(7). In determining whether USP's passive income is high-taxed, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section the $100x dividend and the $30x deduction are allocated to the group of income described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (passive income subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax).
