####### Required adjustments.

(2)If a U.S. person transfers stock of a transferee foreign corporation to a U.S. related person in a transaction that is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following adjustments shall be made:

(i) For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the earnings and profits of the transferee foreign corporation shall be reduced by the amount of any payment deemed to be received by a related U.S. person under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section;

(ii) For purposes of subpart F of part III of subchapter N of the Code, the transferee foreign corporation may allocate and apportion such deemed payments (whether or not such payments are actually made to gross income subject to subpart F to the extent appropriate under the provisions of §§ 1.954-1(c) and 1.861-8;

(iii) For purposes of reapplying the rules of paragraph (d) and (e) of this section, if the related U.S. person is deemed to have received a right to contingent annual payments for the use of intangible property, then the U.S. related person shall be deemed to have held a proportionate share of the property with a basis equal to a proportionate share of the U.S. transferor's adjusted basis plus the gain, if any, recognized by the U.S. transferor on the earlier transfer of the stock to the U.S. related person, and then to have transferred that proportionate share of the property to the foreign corporation in a transfer subject to section 367(d); and

(iv) If the U.S. transferor is itself required to recognize gain upon the transfer by reason of the operation of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section (because stock of the transferee foreign corporation is also transferred to unrelated persons), then those unrelated persons shall be deemed to have purchased a proportionate share of the transferred intangible property at fair market value and immediately contributed that property to the transferee foreign corporation, consistent with the general rule of paragraph (d)(2) of this section concerning transfers of stock to unrelated persons. Therefore, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code-

(A) Each unrelated person's basis in the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be increased to the extent of the gain recognized by the U.S. transferor upon the deemed purchase of intangible property by that person; and

(B) The transferee foreign corporation will receive an increase in its basis in the transferred intangible property equal to the fair market value of that portion of the intangible property deemed to be contributed to the transferee foreign corporation by unrelated persons (as calculated for purposes of determining the gain required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor).
