##### ยง 57.8 Tax treatment of fee.
###### Treatment as an excise tax.

(a)The fee is treated as an excise tax for purposes of subtitle F (sections 6001-7874). Thus, references in subtitle F to "taxes imposed by this title," "internal revenue tax," and similar references, are also references to the fee. For example, the fee is assessed (section 6201), collected (sections 6301, 6321, and 6331), enforced (section 7602), and subject to examination and summons (section 7602) in the same manner as taxes imposed by the Code.
