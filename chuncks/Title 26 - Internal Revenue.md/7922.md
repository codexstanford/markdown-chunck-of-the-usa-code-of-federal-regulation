()In a series of related transactions, A has obtained the use of $1,000x for six months and created a loss of $13x substantially incurred in consideration of the time value of money. A would not have entered into the gold transactions in the ordinary course of A's trade or business. A entered into the transactions with a principal purpose of structuring the transactions to reduce its interest expense (in effect, A sought to convert what otherwise would be interest expense into a loss through the transactions). As a result, under paragraph (b)(22)(iv)(A)() of this section, for purposes of section 163(j), the loss of $13x is treated by A as interest expense.
