####### Depreciation.

(c)In addition to expenditures for the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, there also shall be treated as an expenditure to which section 182 applies a reasonable allowance for depreciation not otherwise deductible on property of the taxpayer which is used in the clearing of land for the purpose of making such land suitable for use in farming, provided the property is property which, if used in a trade or business, would be subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. Depreciation allowable as a deduction under section 182 is limited to the portion of depreciation which is attributable to the use of the property in the clearing of land. The depreciation shall be computed in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. To the extent an amount representing a reasonable allowance for depreciation with respect to property used in clearing land is treated as an expenditure to which section 182 applies, such depreciation shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, be treated as an amount allowed under section 167 for depreciation. Thus, if a deduction is allowed for depreciation under section 182 in respect of property used in clearing land, proper adjustment to the basis of the property so used shall be made under section 1016(a).
