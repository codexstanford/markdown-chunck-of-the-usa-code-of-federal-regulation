###### ยง 53.4960-3 Determination of whether there is a parachute payment.
####### Excludable fringe benefits.

(3)Because the base amount includes only compensation that is includible in gross income, the base amount does not include certain items that may constitute parachute payments. For example, payments in the form of excludable fringe benefits or excludable health care benefits are not included in the base amount but may be treated as parachute payments.
