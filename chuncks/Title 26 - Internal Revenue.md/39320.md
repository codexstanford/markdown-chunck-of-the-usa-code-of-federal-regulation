####### Sales of property for ultimate use in the United States.

(ii)For purposes of subdivision (4)(i) of this paragraph, a purchaser of property (including components, as defined in subdivision (4)(vii) of this paragraph) is deemed to use the property ultimately in the United States if any of the following conditions exist:

(A) The purchaser is a related party with respect to the seller and the purchaser ultimately uses the property, or a second product into which the property is incorporated as a component, in the United States.

(B) At the time of the sale, there is an agreement or understanding that the property, or a second product into which the property is incorporated as a component, will be ultimately used by the purchaser in the United States.

(C) At the time of the sale, a reasonable person would have believed that the property or the second product would be ultimately used by the purchaser in the United States unless, in the case of a sale of components, the fair market value of the components at the time of delivery to the purchaser constitutes less than 20 percent of the fair market value of the second product into which the components are incorporated (determined at the time of completion of the production, manufacture, or assembly of the second product).
