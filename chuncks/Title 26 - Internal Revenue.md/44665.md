###### ยง 1.1061-5 Section 1061(d) transfers to related persons.
####### Application of section 1061(d

(ii)). Because the contribution by A and B of their interest in GP to PRS2 is an exchange in which no gain is recognized by either A or B, the contribution is not a transfer as described in paragraph (b) of this section thus section 1061(d) does not apply to A and B's contribution. However, the API remains an API in the hands of PRS2 under ยง 1.1061-2(a)(1)(i).
