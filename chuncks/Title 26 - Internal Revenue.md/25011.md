####### Analysis for 2024.

(C)In 2024, the ownership of the good is transferred to Customer. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, A is required to include $95x, the remaining portion of all advance payments that were not required to be included in gross income in a prior taxable year ($100x of total advance payments received less $5x that was required to be included in gross income in 2022). Although A does not reduce such amount by a cost offset, it reduces gross income in 2024 by recovering the $45x of costs capitalized to inventory as cost of goods sold ($35x costs incurred in 2022 plus $10x costs incurred in 2024) in accordance with sections 471 and 263A. Accordingly, A's gross income for 2024 is $50x.
