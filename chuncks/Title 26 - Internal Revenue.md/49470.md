####### Hold mail instruction.,hold mail instruction

(ii)The termmeans a current instruction by a person to keep the person's mail until such instruction is amended. An instruction to send all correspondence electronically is not a hold mail instruction. An address that is subject to a hold mail instruction may be used as a permanent residence address if the person has also provided the withholding agent with documentary evidence described in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) (without regard to the requirement in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) that the documentary evidence contain a permanent residence address). The documentary evidence described in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) must support the person's claim of foreign status or, in the case of a person that is claiming treaty benefits, must support residence in the country where the person is claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. If, after a withholding certificate is provided, a person's permanent residence address is subsequently subject to a hold mail instruction, the addition of the hold mail instruction is a change in circumstances requiring the person to provide the documentary evidence described in this paragraph (c)(38)(ii) in order for a withholding agent to use the address as a permanent residence address.
