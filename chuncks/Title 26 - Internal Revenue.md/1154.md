##### credits allowable under sections 30 through 45D
###### ยง 1.42-19 Average income test.
####### Qualified basis.

(B)To determine qualified basis in Year 2, the 8 units in the identified qualified group of units are used in the applicable fraction determination when calculating qualified basis for purposes of determining the annual credit amount under section 42(a). Unit #6 could not have been identified in the qualified group of units for use in the applicable fraction determination because its lack of habitability prevents it from being a low-income unit. Further, Taxpayer could not have identified all 9 of the habitable units to be used in the qualified group of units for the applicable fraction determination because the average of imputed income limitations of those 9 exceeds 60 percent of AMGI. Taxpayer had a choice of which of Units ##1-5 it was going to not identify for use in the applicable fraction determination. Omitting any one of them reduces the average limitation of the remaining group of 8 units to an amount that does not exceed 60 percent of AMGI. Given taxpayer's decision to leave out Unit #5, Units ##1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are taken into account in the applicable fraction.
