####### Distributions from estate or trust.

(2)If farm recapture property is distributed from an estate or trust in a transaction to which section 1251(d) (1) or (2) (relating to exceptions for gifts and transfers at death) applies, then the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust shall be succeeded to by the distributee in the amount, if any, and manner prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence only, the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be applied by treating each distribution as a gift at the time made. Thus; for example, if all of the farm recapture property of an estate or trust is distributed to a distributee on the date the estate or trust terminates, the distributee will succeed on that date to the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust.
