###### ยง 1.904-5 Look-through rules as applied to controlled foreign corporations and other entities.
####### Priority and ordering of look-through rules.

(2)Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(2), to the extent the look-through rules assign income to a separate category, the income is assigned to that separate category rather than the separate category to which the income would have been assigned under ยง 1.904-4 (not taking into account ยง 1.904-4(l)). See paragraph (k) of this section for ordering rules for applying the look-through rules. However, passive income that is financial services income is assigned to a separate category under the rules in ยง 1.904-4(e)(1), (f)(1), and (l), regardless of whether the look-through rules otherwise would have assigned such income to the passive category.
