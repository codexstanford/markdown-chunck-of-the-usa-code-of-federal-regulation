####### Example 3: Investing or Developing Actions taken after Raising or Returning Capital Actions that do not meet the ATB Activity Test.

(iii)In year 1, PRS engaged in Raising or Returning Capital Actions to fund PRS's investment in Specified Assets. However, PRS' Specified Actions during year 1 did not satisfy the ATB Activity Test because they did not satisfy the level of activity required to establish a trade or business under section 162. Therefore, PRS was not engaged in an ATB in year 1. In year 2, PRS engaged in significant Investing or Developing Actions but did not engage in any Raising or Returning Capital Actions. In year 2, PRS's Investing or Developing Actions rise to the level required to establish a trade or business under section 162. Because PRS has cumulatively engaged in both Investing or Developing Actions and Raising or Returning Capital Actions and because the Specified Actions rise to the level of activity required to establish a trade or business under section 162, PRS is engaged in an ATB in year 2.
