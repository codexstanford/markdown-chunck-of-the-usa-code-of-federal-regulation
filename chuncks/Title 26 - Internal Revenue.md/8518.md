####### Application of section.

(ii)The amount of a taxpayer's tax items properly allocable to a trade or business, other than interest expense and interest income, that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j) is determined as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The amount of a taxpayer's interest expense and interest income that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j) generally is determined as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer's activities are not treated as a separate trade or business to the extent those activities involve the provision of real property, goods, or services to a trade or business of the taxpayer (or, if the taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group, the consolidated group). For example, if a taxpayer engaged in a manufacturing trade or business has in-house legal personnel that provide legal services solely with respect to the taxpayer's manufacturing business, the taxpayer is not treated as also engaged in the trade or business of providing legal services. Similarly, if the taxpayer described in the previous sentence constructs or acquires real property solely for use by the taxpayer's manufacturing business, the taxpayer is not treated as also engaged in a real property trade or business.
