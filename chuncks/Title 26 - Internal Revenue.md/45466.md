##### Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses
###### ยง 1.1245-6 Relation of section 1245 to other sections.
####### General.

(a)The provisions of section 1245 apply notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under section 1245(b) applies, gain under section 1245(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1245 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (2) of paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.1245-1. For effect of section 1245 on basis provisions of the Code, see ยง 1.1245-5.
