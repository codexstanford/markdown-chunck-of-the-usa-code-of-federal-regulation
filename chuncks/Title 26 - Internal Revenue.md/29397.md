####### Qualifying expenditures.

(b)Qualifying expenditures are expenditures by an organization for the acquisition, construction, management, maintenance, and care of the organization's association property. They include both current operating and capital expenditures on association property. Qualifying expenditures include expenditures on association property despite the fact that such property may produce income which is not exempt function income. Thus expenditures on a swimming pool are qualifying expenditures despite the fact that fees from guests of members using the pool are not exempt function income. Where expenditures by an organization are used both for association property as well as other property, an allocation shall be made between the two uses on a reasonable basis. Only that portion of the expenditures which is properly allocable to the acquisition, construction, management, maintenance or care of association property, shall constitute qualifying expenditures.
