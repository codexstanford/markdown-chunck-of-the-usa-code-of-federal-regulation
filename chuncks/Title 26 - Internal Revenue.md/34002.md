####### Qualified real estate investment trusts.

(f)The term "qualified real estate investment trust" means a real estate investment trust within the meaning of part II of subchapter M which is taxable under such part as a real estate investment trust. For purposes of the 75-percent requirement in section 856(c)(5)(A), the trust whose stock has been included by another trust as "real estate assets" must be a "qualified real estate investment trust" for its full taxable year in which falls the close of each quarter of the trust's taxable year for which the computation is made. For example, Real Estate Investment Trust Z for its taxable year ending December 31, 1963, holds as "real estate assets" stock in Real Estate Investment Trust Y, which is also on a calendar year. If Trust Y is not a qualified real estate investment trust for its full taxable year ending December 31, 1963, Trust Z may not include the stock of Trust Y as "real estate assets" in computing the 75-percent requirement as of the close of any quarter of its taxable year ending December 31, 1963.
