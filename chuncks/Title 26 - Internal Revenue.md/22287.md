####### Application.

(4)The determination provided for in paragraph (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this A-9 may be made separately with respect to each employee, or on the basis of groups of employees who fall within particular job categories as established by the employer on a reasonable basis. For example, under the rule of this paragraph (e)(4) an employer may exclude all office cleaning personnel if, for the year in question, the employees performing this function normally work less than 17hours a week. This is true even though one or more employees within this group normally work in excess of 17hours. The election to make this determination on the basis of individuals or groups is operational and does not require a plan provision.
