###### ยง 31.3406(d)-4 Special rules for readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker.
####### Transactions entered into through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.

(3)If a broker acquires readily tradable instruments for a payee through an account (with the broker) that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as defined in ยง 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), and the broker is not the payor of the instruments, the broker must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor. In addition, if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406 either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number or due to notified payee underreporting as described in section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), respectively, the broker must notify the payor of the instrument to impose withholding with respect to that payee and transmit the information in the manner described in this paragraph (a). After a payor receives a notice from a broker pursuant to section 3406(d)(2)(B) and this paragraph (a), the payor must impose withholding on any accounts of the payee paying reportable interest or dividends as defined in section 3406(b)(2) in accordance with ยง 31.3406(a)-1.
