(iii) If a particular taxable year of the acquiring corporation is its first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of one or more transactions to which section 381(a) applies, and if the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation is also its second taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of one or more other transactions to which section 381(a) applies, then, for the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to such taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the rules contained in both subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall be applied. Insofar as such taxable year constitutes the first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of any transaction, the amount of the dividend carryover from any distributor or transferor corporation involved in such transaction shall be determined separately as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Insofar as such taxable year constitutes the second taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of any transaction, the amount of the dividend carryover from any distributor or transferor corporation involved in the transaction and the acquiring corporation shall be determined as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The aggregate of the dividend carryovers thus determined shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year. Seein paragraph (c) of this section.
