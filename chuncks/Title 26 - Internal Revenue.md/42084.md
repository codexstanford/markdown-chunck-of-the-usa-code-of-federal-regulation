() Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)() of this section, deductions are allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 to the relevant statutory and residual groupings, taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Under § 1.861-8(b), USP's section 965(c) deduction is definitely related to the section 965(a) inclusion, and, therefore, is allocated solely to foreign source general category income. Under § 1.861-9T, based on USP's asset values, the interest expense of $60x is ratably apportioned $30x to foreign source general category income and $30x to U.S. source income. Under § 1.861-8(c)(3), based on $150x of gross U.S. source income and $150x of gross foreign source general category income, the other expenses of $150x are ratably apportioned $75x to foreign source general category income and $75x to U.S. source income. Therefore, USP's deductions allocated and apportioned to foreign source general category income are $175x ($70x + $30x + $75x) and its deductions allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income are $105x ($30x + $75x).
