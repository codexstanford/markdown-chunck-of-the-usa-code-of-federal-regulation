###### ยง 1.904(f)-2 Recapture of overall foreign losses.
####### Section 904(f)(1) recapture,In general.

(c)-(1)In a taxable year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or section 30A, the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount is the amount of foreign source taxable income subject to recharacterization in a taxable year in which recapture of an overall foreign loss is required under paragraph (a) of this section. The section 904(f)(1) recapture amount equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts or fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income. If the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts exceeds fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income, foreign source taxable income in each separate category with an overall foreign loss account is recharacterized in an amount equal to the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount, multiplied by the maximum potential recapture in the overall foreign loss account, divided by the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts. The maximum potential recapture in an overall foreign loss account in a separate category is the lesser of the balance in that overall foreign loss account or the foreign source taxable income for the year in the same separate category as the loss account. If, in any taxable year, in accordance with sections 164(a) and 275(a)(4)(A), a taxpayer deducts rather than credits its foreign taxes, recapture is applied to the extent of the lesser of-

(i) The balance in the overall foreign loss account in each separate category; or

(ii) Foreign source taxable income (net of foreign taxes) in each separate category.
