###### ยง 1.163(j)-3 Relationship of the section 163(j) limitation to other provisions affecting interest.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, section 267(a)(2) is applied before section 163(j). Accordingly, $30x of Y's interest expense cannot be taken into consideration for purposes of section 163(j) in 2021 because it is not currently deductible under section 267(a)(2). Accordingly, in 2021, if the interest expense is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business, Y will have $4x of disallowed business interest expense because the $40x of business interest expense in 2021 ($70x-$30x) exceeds 30 percent of its ATI for the taxable year ($36x). The $30x of interest expense not allowed as a deduction in the 2021 taxable year under section 267(a)(2) will be taken into account in determining the business interest expense deduction under section 163(j) in 2022, the taxable year in which it is allowed as a deduction under section 267(a)(2), if it is allocable to a trade or business. Additionally, the $4x of disallowed business interest expense in 2021 will be carried forward to 2022 as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward. See ยง 1.163(j)-2(c).
