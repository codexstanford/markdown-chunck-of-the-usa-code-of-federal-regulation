(ii) In cases where a taxpayer has more than one employment (i.e., more than one employer at any particular time) his principal place of work is usually determined with reference to his principal employment. The location of a taxpayer's principal place of work is necessarily a question of fact which must be determined on the basis of the particular circumstances in each case. The more important factors to be considered in making a factual determination regarding the location of a taxpayer's principal place of work are () the total time ordinarily spent by the taxpayer at each place, () the degree of the taxpayer's business activity at each place, and () the relative significance of the financial return to the taxpayer from each place.

(iii) In general, a place of work is not considered to be the taxpayer's principal place of work for purposes of this section if the taxpayer maintains an inconsistent position, for example, by claiming an allowable deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) for traveling expenses "while away from home" with respect to expenses incurred while he is not away from such place of work and after he has incurred moving expenses for which a deduction is claimed under this section.
