####### Example 10,Facts.

(10)-(i)X and Y are equal partners in partnership PRS, and are not members of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, X and Y each have an outside basis in PRS of $10. Neither X nor Y's share of partnership liabilities exceeds the adjusted basis of its entire interest. In Year 1, X is allocated $8 of excess business interest expense and $12 of loss from PRS. As a result, X has $4 of excess business interest expense, $4 of negative section 163(j) expense, $6 of allowable loss, $6 of loss suspended under section 704(d), and $0 of outside basis in PRS at the end of Year 1. In Year 2, X sells 50 percent of its interest in PRS to Z for $20. Immediately prior to the sale, X's entire partnership interest had a fair market value of $40 and the transferred portion of the interest had a fair market value of $20.
