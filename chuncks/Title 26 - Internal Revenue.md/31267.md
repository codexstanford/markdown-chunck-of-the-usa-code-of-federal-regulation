##### treatment of excess distributions of trusts applicable to taxable years beginning before january 1, 1969
###### ยง 1.669(a)-3 Tax computed by the exact throwback method.
####### Tax attributable to amounts treated as received in preceding taxable years.

(a)If a taxpayer elects to compute the tax, on amounts deemed distributed under section 666, by the exact throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(A), the tax liability of the beneficiary for the taxable year in which the accumulation distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed is computed as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The beneficiary may not elect to use the exact throwback method of computing his tax on an accumulation distribution as provided in section 669(a)(1)(A) if he were not alive on the last day of each preceding taxable year of the foreign trust created by a U.S. person with respect to which a distribution is deemed made under section 666(a). Thus, if a portion of an amount received as an accumulation distribution was accumulated by the trust during years before the beneficiary was born, the beneficiary is not permitted to elect the exact throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(A). See ยง 1.669(a)-4 for the computation of the tax on an accumulation distribution by the short-cut throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(B) under these circumstances.
