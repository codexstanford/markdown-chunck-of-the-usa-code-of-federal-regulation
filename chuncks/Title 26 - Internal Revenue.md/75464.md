######## Recovery of costs under section 7430

(j)-Reasonable litigation costs, including attorney's fees, not recoverable under this section may be recoverable under section 7430. If following the Internal Revenue Service's denial of an administrative claim on the grounds that the Internal Revenue Service did not violate section 7432(a), a taxpayer brings a civil action for damages in a district court of the United States, and establishes entitlement to damages under this section, substantially prevails with respect to the amount of damages in controversy, and meets the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(iii) (relating to notice and net worth requirements), the taxpayer will be considered a "prevailing party" for purposes of section 7430. Such taxpayer, therefore, will generally be entitled to attorney's fees and other reasonable litigation costs not recoverable under this section. For purposes of the paragraph, if the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to an administrative claim for damages within 30 days after the claim is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond shall be considered a denial of the administrative claim on the grounds that the Internal Revenue Service did not violate section 7432(a). Administrative costs, including attorney's fees incurred pursuing an administrative claim under paragraph (f) of this section, are not recoverable under section 7430.
