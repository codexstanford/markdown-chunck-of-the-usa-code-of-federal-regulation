####### Analysis for 2021 taxable year.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), E is required to include $30,000 in gross income in 2021 as E has a fixed right to receive $30,000 as of the end of 2021. Although E reports $40,000 of AFS revenue for 2021, E has an enforceable right to recover only $30,000 if the Fire Department were to terminate the contract on the last day of 2021. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, of the $40,000 of AFS revenue reported for 2021, only $30,000 is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" under the AFS income inclusion rule. As a result, E is required to include only $30,000 in gross income in 2021.
