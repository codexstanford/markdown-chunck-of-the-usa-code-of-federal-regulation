####### Coordination with section 904(f),In general.

(h)-(1)Section 904(b) and this section shall apply before the provisions of section 904(f) as follows:

(i) The amount of a taxpayer's separate limitation income or loss in each separate category, the amount of overall foreign loss, and the amount of any additions to or recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss accounts pursuant to section 904(f) shall be determined after applying paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (d) and (e) of this section to adjust capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States in each separate category.

(ii) To the extent a capital loss from sources within the United States reduces a taxpayer's foreign source taxable income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, such capital loss shall be disregarded in determining the amount of a taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States for purposes of computing the amount of any additions to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss accounts.

(iii) In determining the amount of a taxpayer's loss from sources in the United States under section 904(f)(5)(D) (section 904(f)(5)(D) amount), the taxpayer shall make appropriate adjustments to capital gains and losses from sources within the United States to reflect adjustments pursuant to section 904(b)(2) and this section. Therefore, for purposes of section 904, a taxpayer's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount shall be equal to the excess of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income in all separate categories in the aggregate for the taxable year (taking into account any adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1), (d) and (e) of this section) over the taxpayer's entire taxable income for the taxable year (taking into account any adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) and (e) of this section).
