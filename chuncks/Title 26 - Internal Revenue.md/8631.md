####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 20 percent of the P group's Year 1 interest expense ($30x/$150x) and interest income ($3x/$15x) is allocable to an excepted trade or business. Thus, $7x ($35x x 20 percent) of P's interest expense and $2x ($10x x 20 percent) of P's interest income is allocable to an excepted trade or business. The remaining $28x of P's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and the remaining $8x of P's interest income is business interest income that increases the group's section 163(j) limitation. In turn, $23x ($115x x 20 percent) of S's interest expense and $1x ($5x x 20 percent) of S's interest income is allocable to an excepted trade or business. The remaining $92x of S's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and the remaining $4x of S's interest income is business interest income that increases the group's section 163(j) limitation.
