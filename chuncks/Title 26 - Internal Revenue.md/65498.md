####### Exception-One-Day rule.

(3)Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, if on any day within a deposit period (monthly or semi-weekly) an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes, those taxes must be deposited by electronic funds transfer in time to satisfy the tax obligation by the close of the next day. If the next day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, the taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of determining whether the $100,000 threshold is met-

(i) A monthly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the calendar month in which the day occurs; and

(ii) A semi-weekly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the Wednesday-Friday or Saturday-Tuesday semi-weekly period in which the day occurs.
