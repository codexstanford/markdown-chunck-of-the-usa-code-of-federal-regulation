(ii) In determining the individual estimated useful lives of assets similar in kind contained in a multiple asset account (or in single asset accounts for which an average life rate is used), the taxpayer may () assign to each of such assets the average useful life of such assets used for purposes of computing depreciation, or () assign separate lives to such assets based on the estimated range of years taken into consideration in establishing the average useful life. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer places nine similar trucks with an average estimated useful life of 7 years, based on an estimated range of 6 to 8 years (two trucks with a useful life of 6 years, five trucks with a useful life of 7 years, and two trucks with a useful life of 8 years), in a multiple asset account for which a group rate is used in computing depreciation, he may either assign a useful life of 6 years to two of the trucks, 7 years to five of the trucks, and 8 years to two of the trucks, or he may assign the average useful life of the trucks (7 years) to each of the nine trucks. Likewise, if a taxpayer places 100 similar telephone poles with an average useful life of 28 years, based on an estimated range of 3 to 40 years (two with a useful life of less than 4 years, three with a useful life of 4 to 6 years, four with a useful life of 6 to 8 years, and 91 with a useful life of more than 8 years), in a multiple asset account for which a group rate is used in computing depreciation, he may either assign useful lives corresponding to the estimated range of years of the poles (, a useful life of less than 4 years to two of the poles, etc.), or he may assign the average useful life of the poles (28 years) to each of the poles.

(iii) [Reserved]

(iv) For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, assets (other than "mass assets") shall not be considered as "similar in kind" in respect of other assets unless all such assets are substantially of the same value, nor shall used section 38 property be considered as "similar in kind" to new section 38 property.
