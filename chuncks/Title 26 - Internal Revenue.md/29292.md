###### ยง 1.514(g)-1 Business lease indebtedness.
####### Property acquired subject to lien.

(c)Where real property is acquired subject to a mortgage or similar lien, whether the acquisition be by gift, bequest, devise, or purchase, the amount of the indebtedness secured by such mortgage or lien is a business lease indebtedness (unless paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies) even though the lessor does not assume or agree to pay the indebtedness. For example, a university pays $100,000 for real estate valued at $300,000 and subject to a $200,000 mortgage. For the purpose of the tax on unrelated business taxable income, the result is the same as if $200,000 of borrowed funds had been used to buy the property.
