####### Method of accounting.

(f)The treatment of inducement fees is a method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the regulations thereunder apply. A taxpayer is generally permitted to adopt a method of accounting for inducement fees that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Once a taxpayer adopts a method of accounting for inducement fees, that method must be applied consistently to all inducement fees received in connection with noneconomic REMIC residual interests and may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner, as provided by section 446(e) and the regulations and procedures thereunder.
