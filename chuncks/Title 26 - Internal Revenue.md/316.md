####### Recovery from sales.

(iii)In determining whether the taxpayer's cost described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section will be recovered from sales in the United States of the designated drug for the disease or condition for which the drug is designated, the taxpayer shall include anticipated sales by the taxpayer or any person whose right to make such sales is directly or indirectly derived from the taxpayer (such as a licensee or transferee). The anticipated sales shall be based upon the size of the anticipated patient population for which the designated drug would be useful, including the following factors: the degree of effectiveness and safety of the designated drug, if known: the projected fraction of the anticipated patient population expected to be given the designated drug and to continue to take it; other available agents and other types of therapy; the likelihood that superior agents will become available within a few years; and the number of years during which the designated drug would be exclusively available, e.g., under a patent.
