Therefore, the food and beverages are not primarily consumed by the general public, and only the costs attributable to the food and beverages provided to the general public are excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to the expenses associated with the food and beverages that are not excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv).
