####### Modification effective within a rental period.

(v)If the effective date of a modification does not coincide with the beginning or end of a rental period under the agreement in effect before the modification, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the effective date of the modification are a pro rata portion of the section 467 rent and the section 467 interest, respectively, for the rental period. Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the effective date of the modification. Similar rules apply with respect to the section 467 rent and section 467 interest determined under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified) for purposes of computing the amount of the section 467 loan under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for a partial rental period beginning on the effective date of the modification.
