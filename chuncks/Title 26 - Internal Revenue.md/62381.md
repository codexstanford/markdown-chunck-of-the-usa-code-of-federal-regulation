###### ยง 20.2056(b)-8 Special rule for charitable remainder trusts.
####### Charitable remainder trusts where the surviving spouse is not the only noncharitable beneficiary.

(b)In the case of a charitable remainder trust where the decedent's spouse is not the only noncharitable beneficiary (for example, where the noncharitable interest is payable to the decedent's spouse for life and then to another individual for life), the qualification of the interest as qualified terminable interest property is determined solely under section 2056(b)(7) and not under section 2056(b)(8). Accordingly, if the decedent died on or before October 24, 1992, or the trust otherwise comes within the purview of the transitional rules contained in ยง 20.2056(b)-7(e)(5), the spousal annuity or unitrust interest may qualify under ยง 20.2056(b)-(7)(e) as a qualifying income interest for life.
