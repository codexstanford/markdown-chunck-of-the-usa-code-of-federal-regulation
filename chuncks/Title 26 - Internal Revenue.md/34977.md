()Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)()() of this section, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is determined as if USP did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i). While USP made the election, no adjustment was made to the stock of CFC1 as a result of the election. However, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is then reduced by $90x, the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(), without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis described in § 1.965-2(h)(2). No adjustment is made to USP's basis in the stock of CFC1 for the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(A)(). Accordingly, for purposes of determining the value of stock of CFC1 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $510x ($600x-$90x).
