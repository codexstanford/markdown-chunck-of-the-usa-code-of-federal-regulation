####### ยง 301.6724-1 Reasonable cause.
######## Unavailability of the relevant business records.

(2)In order to establish reasonable cause under paragraph (c)(1) of this section due to the unavailability of the relevant business records, the filer's business records must have been unavailable under such conditions, in such manner, and for such period as to prevent timely compliance (ordinarily at least a 2-week period prior to the due date (with regard to extensions) of the required return or the required date (with regard to extensions) for furnishing the payee statement), and the unavailability must have been caused by a supervening event. A "supervening event" includes, but is not limited to-

(i) A fire or other casualty that damages or impairs the filer's relevant business records or the filer's system for processing and filing such records;

(ii) A statutory or regulatory change that has a direct impact upon data processing and that is made so close to the time that the return or payee statement is required that, for all practical purposes, the change cannot be complied with; or

(iii) The unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for filing a return or furnishing a payee statement.
