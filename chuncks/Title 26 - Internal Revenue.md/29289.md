###### ยง 1.514(f)-1 Definition of business lease.
####### Exceptions.

(c)(1) A lease shall not be considered a business lease if such lease is entered into primarily for a purpose which is substantially related (aside from the need of such organization for income or funds, or the use it makes of the rents derived) to the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption. For example, where a tax-exempt hospital leases real property owned by it to an association of doctors for use as a clinic, the rents derived under such lease would not be included in computing unrelated business taxable income if the clinic is substantially related to the carrying on of hospital functions. See ยง 1.513-1 for principles applicable in determining whether there is a substantial relationship to the exempt purpose of an organization.

(2) A lease is not a business lease if the lease is of premises in a building primarily designed for occupancy and occupied by the tax-exempt organization.

(3) If a lease for more than 5 years to a tenant is for only a portion of the real property, and space in the real property is rented during the taxable year under a lease for not more than 5 years to any other tenant of the tax-exempt organization, all leases of the real property for more than 5 years shall be considered as business leases during the taxable year only if:

(i) The rents derived from the real property during the taxable year under leases for more than 5 years represent 50 percent or more of the total rents derived during the taxable year from the real property; or the area of the premises occupied under leases for more than 5 years represents, at any time during the taxable year, 50 percent or more of the total area of the real property rented at such time; or

(ii) The rent derived from the real property during the taxable year from any tenant under a lease for more than 5 years, or from a group of tenants (under such leases) who are either members of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504) or are partners, represents more than 10 percent of the total rents derived during the taxable year from such property; or the area of the premises occupied by any one such tenant, or by any such group of tenants, represents at any time during the taxable year more than 10 percent of the total area of the real property rented at such time

(iii) An occupancy which is considered to be a lease of more than 5 years solely by reason of the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this subparagraph shall not be treated as such a lease for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and

(iv) An occupancy which is considered to be a lease of more than 5 years solely by reason of the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be treated as such a lease for purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, and

(v) If during the last half of the term of a lease a new lease is made to take effect after the expiration of such lease, the unexpired portion of the first lease will not be added to the second lease to determine whether such second lease is a lease for more than 5 years for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.

(4) The application of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
