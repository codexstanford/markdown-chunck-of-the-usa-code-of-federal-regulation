###### ยง 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### 2,Five-year basis increase in 2023.

()Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, S and B are treated as divisions of a single entity for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2. In 2023, the single entity has held the QOF investment for five years and its basis in the Q stock would be increased to $10x ($100x x 10%) under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii). To achieve this single entity result, $10x of S's $100x of remaining deferred gain is redetermined to be tax-exempt income. See ยง 1.1502-13(c)(1); see also paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section making ยง 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's intercompany gain. Therefore, in 2023, S is treated as having $10x of tax-exempt income, S's remaining deferred gain is $90x ($100x-$10x), and B's basis in the Q stock remains $250x.
