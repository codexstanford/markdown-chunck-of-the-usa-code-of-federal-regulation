() Section 1336 provides that in determining the unadjusted basis of recovered property, the total gain and the recognized gain with respect to such property must be determined. For such purpose, the recognized gain deemed to be derived from properties described in section 1231(a) may be allocated among such properties in the proportion of the recoveries with respect to such properties, reduced for each property by the portion of the recovery attributable to the nonrecognized gain for such day, and the recoveries with respect to properties not described in section 1231(a) may be similarly allocated. The total gain derived from any recovered property is the sum of the nonrecognized gain attributable to the recovery of such property and of the recognized gain allocable to such property.

(3) The foregoing provisions may be illustrated by the following examples:

(4) An allowable deduction with respect to a war loss is any deduction to which the taxpayer is entitled on account of any war loss property, regardless of whether or not such deduction was claimed by the taxpayer or otherwise allowed in computing his tax. If a deduction was claimed by a taxpayer in computing his tax for any taxable year and if such deduction was disallowed, such deduction will not be considered an allowable deduction for such taxable year since the previous determination will not be reconsidered.
