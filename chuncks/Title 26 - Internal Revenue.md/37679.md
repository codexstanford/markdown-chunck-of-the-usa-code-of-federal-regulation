####### Determination of applicable provisions of general tax,In general.,e.g.,,e.g.,,e.g.,,e.g.,,i.e.,

(4)-(i)If the general tax is a series of income taxes (on different types of income), or if the application of the general tax differs by its terms for different classes of persons subject to the general tax (for persons in different industries), then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the qualifying amount small be computed by reference to the income tax contained in such series of income taxes, or in the case of such different applications the application of the general tax, that by its terms and in practice imposes the highest tax burden on persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the general tax amount shall be computed by reference to the application of the general tax to entities of the same type (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer and to persons of the same resident or nonresident status (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer; and, if the general tax treats business income differently from non-business (investment) income (as determined under the general tax), the dual capacity taxpayer's business and non-business income shall be treated as the general tax treats such income. If, for example, the dual capacity taxpayer would, under the general tax, be treated as a resident (because the general tax treats an entity that is organized in the foreign country or managed or controlled there as a resident) and as a corporation (because the rules of the general tax treat an entity like the dual capacity taxpayer as a corporation), and if some of the dual capacity taxpayer's income would, under the general tax, be treated as business income and some as non-business income, the dual capacity taxpayer and its income shall be so treated in computing the qualifying amount.
