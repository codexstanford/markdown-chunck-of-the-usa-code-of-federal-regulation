####### Freight within the United States.

(v)A DISC may not claim as export promotion expense any amount that is attributable to carriage of export property between points within the United States. If, however, export property is carried from the United States to a foreign country on a through shipment pursuant to a single bill of lading or similar document aboard one or more U.S.-flag carriers, the freight expense of such carriage shall not be apportioned between the domestic and foreign portions of such carriage, even though a carrier may stop en route within the United States or the export property may be shifted from one carrier to another, and one-half of such freight expense may be claimed as an export promotion expense. Freight expense does not include the cost of transporting the export property to the depot of the U.S.-flag carrier or freight forwarder for shipment abroad. The expense of shipment of export property initiated by delivery to the U.S. Postal Service for ultimate delivery outside the United States shall be considered as attributable entirely to carriage of such property outside the United States.
