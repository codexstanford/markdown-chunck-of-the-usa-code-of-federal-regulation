###### ยง 1.163(j)-3 Relationship of the section 163(j) limitation to other provisions affecting interest.
####### Tentative taxable income.

(ii)Under ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(43), tentative taxable income is determined as though all business interest expense was not subject to the section 163(j) limitation. Sections 461(l), 465, and 469 apply in the determination of tentative taxable income. For year 1, D has $500x of allowable deductions and a $500x tentative passive activity loss under section 469, because D's $1000x of passive expenses exceeds D's $500x of passive income from V. The tentative disallowance of $500x is generally allocated pro rata between D's passive expenses under ยง 1.469-1T(f)(2)(ii)(A). In this case, fifty percent ($500x of passive activity loss divided by $1000x of total passive expenses) of each category of passive expense is tentatively disallowed: $200x of business interest expense and $300x of section 162 expense. D's tentative taxable income is $0 (zero), which is determined by reducing $500x of gross income by the remaining $200x of business interest expense and $300x of section 162 expense ($500x-$200x-$300x).
