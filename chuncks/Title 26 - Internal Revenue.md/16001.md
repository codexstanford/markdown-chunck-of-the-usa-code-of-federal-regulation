###### ยง 1.334-1 Basis of property received in liquidations.
####### Operating rules,In general.

(iii)-(A)For purposes of section 334(b)(1)(B) and this paragraph (b)(3), the provisions of ยง 1.362-3 (basis of importation property received in a loss importation transaction) apply, adjusted as appropriate to apply to section 332 liquidations. Thus, when used in this paragraph (b)(3), the terms "importation property," "loss importation transaction," and "value" have the same meaning as in ยง 1.362-3(c)(2), (3), and (4), respectively, except that "the section 332(b)(1) distributee corporation" is substituted for "Acquiring" and "section 332 liquidation" is substituted for "section 362 transaction." Similarly, when gain or loss on property would be owned or treated as owned by multiple persons, the provisions of ยง 1.362-3(d)(2) apply to tentatively divide the property in applying this section, substituting "section 332 liquidation" for "section 362 transaction" and making such other adjustments as necessary.
