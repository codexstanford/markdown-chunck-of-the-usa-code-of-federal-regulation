###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### Example 1.

(i)CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC is a single qualified business unit (QBU) operating in foreign Country X. In Year 1, CFC earns $130x of gross royalty income that is passive income from Country X sources, and incurs $30x of expenses that do not include any payments to USP. CFC's $100x of pre-tax passive income from the royalty is subject to $30x of foreign tax, and is included under section 951(a)(1) in USP's gross income for the taxable year. USP allocates $50x of expenses to the $100x (consisting of the $70x section 951(a)(1) inclusion and $30x section 78 amount), resulting in net passive income of $50x. USP does not elect to exclude from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) the $70x of CFC's net passive income. After application of the high-tax kick-out rules of paragraph (c) of this section, the $50x of USP's net passive income is treated as general category income, and the $30x of taxes deemed paid are treated as taxes imposed on general category income, because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $50x of net passive income ($30x > $10.5x (21% x $50x)).
