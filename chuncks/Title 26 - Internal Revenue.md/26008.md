####### The transferor and its Fund.

(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, neither the transferor nor the transferor's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to the transferee). For purposes of §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of assets by the transferor's Fund.

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the transferor has made a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 prior to the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets, any deduction with respect to that special transfer allowable under section 468A(f)(2) for a taxable year ending after the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets (the unamortized special transfer deduction) is allowed under section 468A(f)(2)(C) for the taxable year that includes the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets. If the taxpayer transfers only a portion of its interest in a nuclear power plant, only the corresponding portion of the unamortized special transfer deduction qualifies for the acceleration under section 468A(f)(2)(C).
