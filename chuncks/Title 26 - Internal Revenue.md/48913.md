####### Analysis.

(B)Based on these facts, the partnership is availed of by the individuals with a significant purpose to avoid the requirements of ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B). Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the partnership is disregarded for purposes of applying ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B) and (b)(11)(ix)(B) with respect to the $50 capital gain from the sale of the individuals' contributed stock and that gain fails to be eligible gain. Under ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b), no section 1400Z-2(a) election is available for that gain and the partnership will have a mixed-funds investment, $100 of which is a qualifying investment and $50 of which is a non-qualifying investment.
