####### 2,Determination of CFC1 gross income (net of interest expense).

()Before including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2, CFC1 has total gross income of $4,000x, including $1500x of CFC2's foreign source gross tested income within the general category and $500x of CFC2's specified foreign source general category gross income which are combined with CFC1's items of gross income under ยง 1.861-9(j)(2)(ii). CFC1's $1,000x of interest expense is apportioned among the statutory groupings of gross income of CFC1 to determine the gross income (net of interest expense) of CFC1 in each statutory grouping. As a result, $750x ($3,000x/$4,000x x $1,000x) of interest expense is apportioned to foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $125x ($500x/$4,000 x $1,000x) to foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category, and $125x ($500x/$4,000x x $1,000x) to specified foreign source general category gross income. Accordingly, CFC1 has the following amounts of gross income (net of interest expense) before including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2: $2,250x ($3,000x - $750x) of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $375x ($500x - $125x) of foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category, and $375x ($500 - $125x) of specified foreign source general category gross income. After including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2, CFC1 has the following amounts of gross income (net of interest expense): $2,250x of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $1,000x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the general category, $375x of specified foreign source general category gross income, and $375x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category.
