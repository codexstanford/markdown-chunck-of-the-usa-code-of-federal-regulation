###### § 1.367(a)-7 Outbound transfers of property described in section 361(a) or (b).
####### Other rules,Section 367(a) property with respect to which gain is recognized.

(e)-(1)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(1), gain recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be treated as recognized with respect to the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange in proportion to the amount of gain realized by the U.S. transferor on the transfer of each item of section 367(a) property. This paragraph (e)(1) will be applied after taking into account any gain or deemed dividends (including any deemed dividends under section 1248(a)) recognized by the U.S. transferor on the transfer of the section 367(a) property in the section 361 exchange pursuant to all other provisions of sections 367(a) and (b) and the regulations under that section. See, for example, §§ 1.367(a)-2, 1.367(a)-3(e), 1.367(a)-4, 1.367(a)-6, and 1.367(b)-4. If the U.S. transferor recognizes gain (including gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) with respect to stock or securities transferred in the section 361 exchange, the realized gain in such stock or securities shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(1) to gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2) of this section attributable to U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C). Accordingly, gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2) attributable to such U.S. transferor shareholders shall not be treated as recognized with respect to such stock or securities under this paragraph. Furthermore, to the extent gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c)(2) is treated as recognized with respect to stock in a foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange to which section 1248(a) applies, the portion of such gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) is the product of the amount of the gain multiplied by the ratio of the amount that would be treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) if all gain in the transferred stock were recognized under § 1.367(a)-7(b) and the amount of gain realized in the transferred stock. See § 1.367(a)-1(b)(4) for additional rules on the character, source, and adjustments relating to gain recognized under section 367(a)(1), and § 1.367(b)-2(e) for rules on the timing, treatment, and effect of amounts included in income as deemed dividends pursuant to regulations under section 367(b).
