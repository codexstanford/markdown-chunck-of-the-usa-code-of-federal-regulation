(c)-(1)Upon a transfer of farm land described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1252) over (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). For purposes of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of ยง 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, in the case of a transfer of farm land and property other than farm land in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the farm land (as determined in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraph (a)(5) of ยง 1.1245-1) shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the farm land bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1252) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1). The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code.
