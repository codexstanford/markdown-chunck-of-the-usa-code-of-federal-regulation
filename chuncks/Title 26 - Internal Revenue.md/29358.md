(b)-(1)(i) Except as provided in this section, the termwill generally have the same meaning it has in ยง 1.527-2(c). Thus, expenditures which are directly related to the selection process as defined in ยง 1.527-2(c)(1) are expenditures for an exempt function. Expenditures for indirect expenses as defined in ยง 1.527-2(c)(2), when made by a section 501(c) organization are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Expenditures of a section 501 (c) organization which are otherwise allowable under the Federal Election Campaign Act or similar State statute are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(ii) An expenditure may be made for an exempt function directly or through another organization. A section 501(c) organization will not be absolutely liable under section 527(f)(1) for amounts transferred to an individual or organization. A section 501(c) organization is, however, required to take reasonable steps to ensure that the transferee does not use such amounts for an exempt function.
