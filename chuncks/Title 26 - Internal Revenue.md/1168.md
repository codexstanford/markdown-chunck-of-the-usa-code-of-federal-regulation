####### Example 6,Facts.

(6)-(i)A single-building housing project received an allocation of housing credit dollar amount, and the taxpayer who owns the project elects the average income test. During Year 2 of the credit period, the disability status under the ADA of a tenant changes, and therefore under the provisions of the ADA, the tenant now needs to reside in a different unit with different accommodations. The tenant currently resides in a unit with a designated imputed income limitation of 40 percent of AMGI. A unit that would meet the tenant's needs is available on the first-floor of the building, but it was previously a low-income unit with a designated imputed income limitation of 70 percent of AMGI and thus a higher maximum gross rent than the tenant's current unit. The tenant moves to the first-floor unit.
