Investment income and carrying charges are not foreign trading gross receipts. Investment income and carrying charges are includable in the taxable income of an FSC, except in the case of a commission FSC where carrying charges are treated as income of the related supplier, and are treated as income effectively connected with a trade or business conducted through a permanent establishment within the United States. The source of investment income and carrying charges is determined under sections 861, 862, and 863 of the Code.
