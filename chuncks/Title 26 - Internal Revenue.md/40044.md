####### ii,Determination of pro rata share of qualified business asset investment.

()The special rule of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section applies because FS's tested income of $50x is less than FS's hypothetical tangible return of $150x, which is 10% of FS's qualified business asset investment of $1,500x. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, R Corp's pro rata share of FS's qualified business asset investment is the amount that bears the same ratio to FS's qualified business asset investment as R Corp's pro rata share of the hypothetical tangible return of FS bears to the total hypothetical tangible return of FS. R Corp's pro rata share of FS's hypothetical tangible return is its pro rata share under section 951(a)(2)(A) and ยง 1.951-1(b)(1)(i) ($150x), reduced under section 951(a)(2)(B) and ยง 1.951-1(b)(1)(ii) by $20x, which is the lesser of $20x, the dividend received by P Corp during Year 1 with respect to the FS stock acquired by R Corp ($20x) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the hypothetical tangible return ($150x) of FS for Year 1 and the denominator of which is the sum of the subpart F income ($0) and the hypothetical tangible return ($150x) of FS for Year 1 ($20x x $150x/$150x), and $60x, which is P Corp's pro rata share (100%) of the amount which bears the same ratio to FS's hypothetical tangible return for Year 1 ($150x) as the period during which R Corp did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the FS stock (146 days) bears to the entire taxable year (1 x $150x x 146/365). Accordingly, R Corp's pro rata share of the hypothetical tangible return of FS for Year 1 is $130x ($150x - $20x), and R Corp's pro rata share of FS's qualified business asset investment is $1,300x ($1,500x x $130x/$150x).
