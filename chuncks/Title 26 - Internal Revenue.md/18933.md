(o)-(1) Neither § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(i) nor § 1.382-4(d) (relating to the treatment of options as exercised) applies to the following options to acquire stock of a loss corporation reorganized pursuant to a plan of reorganization that is confirmed in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) but only until the time the plan becomes effective-

(i) Any option created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances to the plan;

(ii) The option created by the confirmation of the plan; and

(iii) Any option created under the plan.

(2) This paragraph (o) generally applies to any testing date occurring on or after September 5, 1990. However, this paragraph (o) does not apply on any testing date occurring on or after April 8, 1992, if, in connection with the plan of reorganization, the loss corporation issues stock (including stock described in section 1504(a)(4)) or otherwise receives a capital contribution before the effective date of the plan for a principal purpose of using before the effective date losses and credits that would be subject to limitation under section 382(a) or would be eliminated under section 382(l)(5)(B) or (C) if this paragraph (o) did not apply on the testing date. A loss corporation may elect to apply this paragraph (o) to any testing date occurring before September 5, 1990, by filing a statement substantially similar to the following with its income tax return: "THIS IS AN ELECTION TO APPLY § 1.382-3(o) (OR § 1.382-9(o) AFTER REDESIGNATION) FOR TESTING DATES PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 5, 1990, TO OPTIONS CREATED BY OR UNDER A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONFIRMED IN A TITLE 11 OR SIMILAR CASE." A loss corporation may elect to not apply this paragraph (o) to testing dates occurring on or after September 5, 1990, to April 8, 1992, by filing a statement substantially similar to the following with its income tax return: "THIS IS AN ELECTION TO NOT APPLY § 1.382-3(o) (OR § 1.382-9(o) AFTER REDESIGNATION) FOR TESTING DATES OCCURRING ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 5, 1990, TO APRIL 8, 1992, TO OPTIONS CREATED BY OR UNDER A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONFIRMED IN A TITLE 11 OR SIMILAR CASE."
