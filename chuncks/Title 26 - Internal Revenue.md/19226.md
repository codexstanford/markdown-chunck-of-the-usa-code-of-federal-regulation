() Because the issuance of DS2 Note by DS2 in exchange for the property of USS2 in an asset reorganization is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the distribution and acquisition of DS2 Note by USS2 is not treated as a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, USS2 Note is not treated as funding the distribution of DS2 Note for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
