####### Certain rules for tax-exempt bonds,Conduit loans.

(6)-(i)For purposes of this section, the obligor of a tax-exempt bond is the entity that actually issues the bond and not a conduit borrower of bond proceeds. In determining whether there is a significant modification of a tax-exempt bond, however, transactions between holders of the tax-exempt bond and a borrower of a conduit loan may be an indirect modification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For example, a payment by the holder of a tax-exempt bond to a conduit borrower to waive a call right may result in an indirect modification of the tax-exempt bond by changing the yield on that bond.
