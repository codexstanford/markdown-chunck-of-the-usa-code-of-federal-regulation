####### Termination of sponsoring entity.

(ii)If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that its status is terminated, the sponsoring entity must send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which each sponsored direct reporting NFFE receives payments and each financial institution with which each sponsored direct reporting NFFE holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in ยง 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) was provided. A sponsoring entity that has had its status terminated cannot reregister on the FATCA registration website to act as a sponsoring entity for any sponsored direct reporting NFFE unless it receives written approval from the IRS. Unless the status of the sponsored direct reporting NFFEs has been terminated, the sponsored direct reporting NFFEs may register on the FATCA registration website as direct reporting NFFEs or as sponsored direct reporting NFFEs of another sponsoring entity, other than a sponsoring entity that is related to the sponsoring entity that was terminated (absent written approval from the IRS allowing the registration). An entity is related to the terminated sponsoring entity if they have a relationship with each other that is described in section 267(b) or 707(b).
