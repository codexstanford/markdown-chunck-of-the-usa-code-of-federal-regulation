####### No change to exclusion provisions and the treatment of non-recognition transactions,In general.

(g)-(1)The AFS income inclusion rule accelerates the time at which the all events test under ยง 1.451-1(a) is treated as satisfied, and therefore does not change the applicability of any exclusion provision, or the treatment of non-recognition transactions, in the Code, the regulations in this part, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see ยง 601.601(d) of this chapter). The following are examples of exclusion provisions and non-recognition transactions that are not affected by the AFS income inclusion rule:

(i) Any non-recognition transaction, within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45), including, for example, a liquidation described in sections 332 and 337, an exchange described in section 351, a distribution described in section 355, a reorganization described in section 368, a contribution described in section 721, or transactions described in sections 1031 through 1045; and

(ii) Items specifically excluded from income under sections 101 through 140.
