###### § 1.965-2 Adjustments to earnings and profits and basis.
####### 1,CFC1 section 965(a) earnings amount.

()The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC1 is 10u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to the amount of CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits of 10u. CFC1's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is equal to its post-1986 earnings and profits because CFC1 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, and therefore no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7). But for § 1.965-4(f), CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, would be 110u, but because the distribution from CFC2 is a specified payment, it is disregarded in determining CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, under § 1.965-4(f). Under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B), the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC1 are not reduced by the 10u distribution to USP.
