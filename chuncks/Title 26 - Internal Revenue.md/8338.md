###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Partner-level allocations.

(iii)PRS allocates its $100 of excess taxable income to X and Y pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(f)(2). To determine each partner's share of the $100 of excess taxable income, PRS must determine each partner's allocable ATI (as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-6(f)(2)(ii)). Because PRS made the election described in ยง 1.163(j)-6(d)(5), PRS must determine the allocable ATI of each of its partners pursuant to paragraph (d)(5). Specifically, PRS determines each partner's share of allocable ATI based on PRS's 2019 section 704 income, gain, loss, and deduction. PRS had $100 of section 704(b) income in 2019 which was allocated $50 to X and $50 to Y. Therefore, in 2020, X and Y are both allocated $50 of excess taxable income (50% x $100).
