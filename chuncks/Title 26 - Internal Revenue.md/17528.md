###### ยง 1.367(a)-8 Gain recognition agreement requirements.
####### Multiple events within a taxable year.

(ii)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), if the initial transfer and one or more dispositions or other events (even if a triggering event exception applies) that affect the gain recognition agreement entered into by the U.S. transferor with respect to the initial transfer occur within the same taxable year of such U.S. transferor, or if multiple dispositions or other events occur in a taxable year of the U.S. transferor that does not include the initial transfer, only one gain recognition agreement is required to be entered into and included with the timely-filed return of the U.S. transferor for such taxable year. The gain recognition agreement must describe the initial transfer and/or each disposition or other event that affects the gain recognition agreement (even if a triggering event exception applies). This paragraph does not apply, however, if any such disposition or other event requires a new gain recognition agreement to be entered into by a United States person other than the U.S. transferor with respect to the initial transfer or that entered into the existing gain recognition agreement, as applicable.
