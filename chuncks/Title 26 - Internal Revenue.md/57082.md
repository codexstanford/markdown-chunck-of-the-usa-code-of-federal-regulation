####### Manner of requesting TIN.

(2)An interest recipient need not separately mail a request for a TIN. An interest recipient may include a request in its regular mailing of payment coupon booklets or annual statements. If an interest recipient makes no mailing to a payor of record during the year in which the payor of record incurs the obligation, it must request the TIN in a separate mailing. No particular form is required to request a TIN. Nevertheless, an interest recipient must make the request on a separate paper and must clearly notify a payor of record that the Internal Revenue Service requires the payor of record to furnish a TIN in order to verify any mortgage interest deduction. An interest recipient must notify a payor of record that failure to furnish a TIN subjects the payor of record to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9 satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (f)(2).
