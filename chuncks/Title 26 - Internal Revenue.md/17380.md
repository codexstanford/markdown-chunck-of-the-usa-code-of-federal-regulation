() The domestic acquired corporation is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer (but at least one) domestic corporations (controlling domestic corporations) immediately before the reorganization, appropriate basis adjustments under section 367(a)(5) are made to the stock received by the controlling domestic corporations in the reorganization, and any other conditions as provided in regulations under section 367(a)(5) are satisfied. For purposes of determining whether the domestic acquired corporation is controlled by five or fewer domestic corporations, all members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504 are treated as one corporation. Any adjustments to stock basis required under section 367(a)(5) must be made to the stock received by the controlling domestic corporation in the reorganization so the appropriate amount of built-in gain in the property transferred by the domestic acquired corporation to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange is reflected in the stock received. The basis adjustment requirement cannot be satisfied by adjusting the basis in stock of the foreign acquiring corporation held by the controlling domestic corporation before the reorganization. To the extent the appropriate amount of built-in gain in the property transferred by the domestic acquired corporation to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange cannot be preserved in the stock received by the controlling domestic corporation in the reorganization, the domestic acquired corporation's transfer of property to the foreign acquiring corporation is subject to section 367(a) and (d).
