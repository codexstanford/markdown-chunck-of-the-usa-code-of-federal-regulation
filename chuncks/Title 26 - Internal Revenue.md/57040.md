(ii)An interest recipient may treat interest received during the current calendar year which properly accrues by January 15 of the subsequent calendar year as interest received for the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly interest payment on December 31, 1988, which includes interest accruing for the period December 5, 1988, to January 5, 1989, the interest recipient may treat the entire interest payment as received for 1988. If a portion of an interest payment received in a current calendar year accrues after January 15 of the subsequent calendar year, an interest recipient must report as interest received for the current calendar year only the portion that properly accrues by the end of the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly payment that includes interest accruing for the period December 20, 1988, through January 20, 1989, the interest recipient may not report as interest received for 1988 any interest accruing after December 31, 1988. The interest recipient must report the interest accruing after December 31, 1988, as received for calendar year 1989.
