####### In general.,United States

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, nothing in section 165(a) and the regulations thereunder, or in any other provision of law, shall be construed to provide a deduction for any loss sustained on any registration-required obligation held after December 31, 1982, unless the obligation is in registered form or the issuance of the obligation was subject to tax under section 4701. The term "registration-required obligation" has the meaning given to that term in section 163(f)(2), except that clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) thereof shall not apply. Therefore, although an obligation that is not in registered form is described in ยง 1.163-5(c)(1), the holder of such an obligation shall not be allowed a deduction for any loss sustained on such obligation unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. The term "holder" means the person that would be denied a loss deduction under section 165(j)(1) or denied capital gain treatment under section 1287(a). For purposes of this section, the termmeans the United States and its possessions within the meaning of ยง 1.163-5(c)(2)(iv).
