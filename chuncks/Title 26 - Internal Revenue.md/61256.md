###### Treatment of tax exempt interest.

(6)Foreign personal holding company income includes all interest income, including interest that is exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103 ("tax-exempt interest"). However, that net foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall be treated as tax-exempt interest in the hands of the U.S. shareholders of the foreign corporation. Accordingly, any net foreign base company income that is included in the subpart F income of a U.S. shareholder and that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall remain exempt from the regular income tax, but potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax, in the hands of the U.S. shareholder.
