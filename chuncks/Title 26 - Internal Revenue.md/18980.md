####### Controlled partnership.

(1)The term controlled partnership means, with respect to an expanded group, a partnership with respect to which at least 80 percent of the interests in partnership capital or profits are owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more members of the expanded group. For purposes of identifying a controlled partnership, indirect ownership of a partnership interest is determined by applying the principles of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Such determination is separate from the determination of the status of a corporation as a member of an expanded group. An unincorporated organization described in ยง 1.761-2 that elects to be excluded from all of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is not a controlled partnership.
