###### ยง 1.585-6 Recapture method of changing from the reserve method of section 585.
####### Certain section 381 transactions.

(3)This paragraph (c)(3) applies if a bank to which this section applies transfers outstanding loans to another corporation on or after the first day of the bank's disqualification year (and before it has included in income the full amount of its net section 481(a) adjustment) in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and under paragraph (c)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section the transferor bank is not treated as ceasing to engage in the business of banking as a result of the transaction. If this paragraph (c)(3) applies, the acquiring corporation (the acquiror) steps into the shoes of the transferor with respect to using the recapture method prescribed by this section and assumes all of the transferor's rights and obligations under paragraph (b) of this section. The unrecaptured balance of the transferor's net section 481(a) adjustment carries over in the transaction to the acquiror, and the acquiror must complete the four-year recapture procedure begun by the transferor. In applying this procedure, the transferor's taxable year that ends on or includes the date of the acquisition and the acquiror's first taxable year ending after the date of the acquisition represent two consecutive taxable years within the four-year recapture period.
