(ii)-(A)The $70,000x of R&E expenditures incurred in Year 2 by X in connection with small gasoline engines are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in the United States and PCT Payments from Y. Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to this class of gross intangible income. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A are not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of X's R&E expenditures is allocated to X's U.S. source interest income or section 951A category income.
