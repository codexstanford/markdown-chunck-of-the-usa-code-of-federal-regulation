####### tax previously determined

(3) The determination of the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing the deductions allowable in any prior taxable year with respect to the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which the taxpayer has made a recovery by an amount equal to the part of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery shall be made as provided in this subparagraph. Such total increase shall include the increases described in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, and shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax under subtitle A for the taxable year of the recovery. Proper adjustment of such increases shall be made on account of the application of the provisions of this subparagraph to intervening taxable years. Proper adjustment shall also be made in the determination of such increases in the case of a taxpayer who has made a valid election under section 1020, relating to the adjustment of basis of property for depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion. The termas used in this subparagraph shall have the same meaning as used in section 1314(a) and shall include any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In computing the amount of the increase in the tax previously determined under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year, the principles of section 1314(a) shall be applicable. See section 1314(a) and the regulations thereunder. However, the computation of the excess profits credit under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year shall not be affected by the adjustment provided in this subparagraph. All credits allowable against the tax for any year shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax previously determined. The increases referred to above include the following:

(i) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for each prior taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable deduction (to the extent that it does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures or accruals in such prior taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or section 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or section 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.

(ii) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which a net operating loss deduction was allowable, if all or a part of such deduction was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of a net operating loss from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction. In the determination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss shall be recomputed by disregarding the deduction allowable on account of the war loss in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.

(iii) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the recomputation such carryover or carryback shall be redetermined by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of the recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase in the tax previously determined shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.

(iv) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which there was allowable a net operating loss deduction attributable to the carryover or carryback to such other taxable year of a net operating loss, and such net operating loss resulted in whole or in part from the deduction allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction and such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the redetermination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss carryover or carryback shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback shall then be recomputed to conform to the redetermination of the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year from which the unused credit is carried over or carried back. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed shall be the amount of the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of the recovery. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of the recovery shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.
