####### Computation of tax.

(b)The tax referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is computed as follows:

(1) First, compute the tax attributable to the section 666 amounts for each of the preceding taxable years. To determine the section 666 amounts attributable to each of the preceding taxable years, see ยง 1.666(a)-1. The tax attributable to such amounts in each such preceding taxable year is the difference between the tax for such preceding taxable year computed with the inclusion of the section 666 amounts in gross income, and the tax for such year computed without including them in gross income. Tax computations for each preceding year shall reflect the taxpayer's marital and dependency status for that year.

(2) Second, add

(i) The sum of the taxes for the preceding taxable years attributable to the section 666 amounts (computed in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), and

(ii) The tax for the taxable year of the beneficiary in which the accumulation distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him, computed without including the section 666 amounts in gross income.
