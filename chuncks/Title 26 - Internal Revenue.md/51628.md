####### Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.

(ii)The IRS may determine in its discretion that a sponsoring entity may not have substantially complied with the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to any sponsored FFI. This determination is based on the information reporting forms described in ยง 1.1471-4(d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) filed with the IRS by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsored FFI (or the absence of reporting), the certifications made by the responsible officer described in paragraphs (j)(3) and (5) of this section (or the absence of such certifications), or any other information related to the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to any sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer (or designee) information necessary to verify the sponsoring entity's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may request, for example, a description or copy of the sponsoring entity's policies and procedures for fulfilling the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA, a description or copy of the sponsoring entity's procedures for conducting its periodic review, or a copy of any written reports documenting the findings of such review. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the facts and circumstances surrounding the sponsoring entity's potential failure to comply with respect to each sponsored FFI with the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA.
