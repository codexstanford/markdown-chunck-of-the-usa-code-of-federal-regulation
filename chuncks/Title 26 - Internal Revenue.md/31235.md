(iv) Fourth, add the additional taxes resulting from the application of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph and then divide this amount by 3. For example, if these additional taxes are $4,000, $5,000, and $6,000 for the 3 preceding taxable years, this amount would be $5,000 ($4,000 + $5,000 + $6,000 divided by 3).

(v) Fifth, the resulting amount is then multiplied by the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed (previously determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph). For example, if an amount is deemed distributed for 5 preceding taxable years, the resulting amount would be five times the $5,000 amount.
