###### ยง 1.446-1 General rule for methods of accounting.
####### Special rules.

(2)(i) In any case in which it is necessary to use an inventory, the accrual method of accounting must be used with regard to purchases and sales unless:

(A) The taxpayer qualifies as a small business taxpayer for the taxable year under section 471(c), or

(B) Otherwise authorized under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) No method of accounting will be regarded as clearly reflecting income unless all items of gross profit and deductions are treated with consistency from year to year. The Commissioner may authorize a taxpayer to adopt or change to a method of accounting permitted by this chapter although the method is not specifically described in the regulations in this part if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, income is clearly reflected by the use of such method. Further, the Commissioner may authorize a taxpayer to continue the use of a method of accounting consistently used by the taxpayer, even though not specifically authorized by the regulations in this part, if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, income is clearly reflected by the use of such method. See section 446(a) and paragraph (a) of this section, which require that taxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books, and section 446(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, which require the prior approval of the Commissioner in the case of changes in accounting method.
