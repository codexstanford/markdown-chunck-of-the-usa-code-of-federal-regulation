######## Determining an election is invalid.

(d)The IRS may determine an election to be invalid without first notifying the partnership or providing the partnership an opportunity to correct any failure to satisfy all of the provisions of this section and ยง 301.6226-2. If an election under this section is determined by the IRS to be invalid, the IRS will notify the partnership and the partnership representative within 30 days of the determination that the election is invalid and the reason for the determination that the election is invalid. If the IRS makes a determination that an election under this section is invalid, section 6225 applies with respect to the imputed underpayment as if the election was never made, the IRS may assess the imputed underpayment against the partnership (without regard to the limitations under section 6232(b)), and the partnership must pay the imputed underpayment under section 6225 and any penalties and interest under section 6233. The IRS may not determine that an election is invalid based on errors timely corrected by the partnership in accordance with ยง 301.6226-2(d).
