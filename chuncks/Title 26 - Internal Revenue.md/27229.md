(ii)Whether a method provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result also depends upon the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, the reliability of the assumptions, and the sensitivity of the results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions.

These factors are discussed in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.
