###### ยง 1.382-8 Controlled groups.
####### Special transition rule for controlled groups that had ownership changes before January 29, 1991.

(ii)For purposes of this section, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, the controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss does not include a corporation that is not a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991. Thus, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, paragraph (c) of this section does not require that a loss corporation that is a component member of a controlled group to disregard the value of stock of another corporation directly owned immediately after the ownership change in determining the value of its own stock unless the other corporation is a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991.
