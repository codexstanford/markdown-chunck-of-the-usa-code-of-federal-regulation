()An eligible fund that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)() or () of this section based on the present value determination under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)() or () of this section based on the alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(). The alternative calculation in this paragraph is satisfied if the average of the present values of the future qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide, as determined during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present valuation determination, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)() or () of this section, respectively. The determination of such average must be based on the valuations described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section that were carried out during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present value determination, and must use the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide. The determination described in this paragraph must be calculated using a weighted average whereby values are adjusted if the relevant valuations are applicable for different periods (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section) because an eligible fund performs valulations more frequently than on an annual basis. If an eligible fund has been in existence for less than 48 months, this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() is applied to the period that the eligible fund has been in existence. The alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() may be satisfied based on any reasonable determination of the present valuation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)() of this section for any period that starts before the date that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section first apply to an organization or arrangement and ends on or before December 29, 2022.
