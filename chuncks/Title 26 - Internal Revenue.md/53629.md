####### The day a corporation becomes or ceases to be a member,End of the day rule.,1,In general.,2

(ii)-(A)()If a corporation (S), other than one described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)() of this section, becomes or ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, it becomes or ceases to be a member at the end of the day on which its status as a member changes, and its tax year ends for all Federal income tax purposes at the end of that day. Appropriate adjustments must be made if another provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder contemplates the event occurring before or after S's change in status. For example, S's items restored under ยง 1.1502-13 immediately before it becomes a nonmember are taken into account in determining the basis of S's stock under ยง 1.1502-32. On the other hand, if a section 338(g) election is made in connection with S becoming a member, the deemed asset sale under that section takes place before S becomes a member. See ยง 1.338-10(a)(5) (deemed sale excluded from purchasing corporation's consolidated return.)
