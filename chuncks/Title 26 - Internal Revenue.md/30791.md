####### Limitation on amount of deduction.

(b)The deduction in any taxable year may not exceed the product of $5 multiplied by the aggregate number of gravesites sold by the cemetery corporation before the beginning of the taxable year of the trust. In general, the aggregate number of gravesites sold shall be the aggregate number of interment rights sold by the cemetery corporation (including gravesites sold by the cemetery before a care fund trust law was enacted). In addition, the number of gravesites sold shall include gravesites used to make welfare burials. Welfare burials and pre-trust fund law gravesites shall be included only to the extent that the cemetery cares for and maintain such gravesites. For purposes of this section, a gravesite is sold as of the date on which the purchaser acquires interment rights enforceable under local law. The aggregate number of gravesites includes only those gravesites with respect to which the fund or taxable cemetery corporation has an obligation for care and maintenance.
