####### Product liability and other claims for damages.

(ii)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(5), awards for litigation or arbitral damages, prejudgment interest, and payments in settlement of or in anticipation of claims for damages, including punitive damages, arising from claims relating to sales, licenses, or leases of products or the provision of services, are definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income of the type produced by the specific sales or leases of the products or provision of services that gave rise to the claims for damage or injury. Such damages and payments may include, but are not limited to, product liability or patent infringement claims. The deductions are apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in the relevant class in each grouping in the year in which the deductions are allowed. If the claims arise from an event incident to the production or sale of products or provision of services (such as an industrial accident), the payments are definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income ordinarily produced by the assets that are involved in the event. The deductions are apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative values (as determined under the asset method in ยง 1.861-9 for purposes of allocating and apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense) of the assets that were involved in the event or (if the taxpayer no longer owns the assets involved in the event) the assets that are used to produce or sell products or services in the relevant class in each grouping; such values are determined in the year the deductions are allowed.
