####### Example of redetermination.

(B)Assume that an employee died at age 80 in 2019 and the employee's designated beneficiary (who was not the employee's spouse) was age 75 in the year of the employee's death. For 2020, the distribution period that would have applied for the beneficiary was 12.7 years (the period applicable for a 76-year-old under the Single Life Table in formerly applicable ยง 1.401(a)(9)-9), and for 2021, it would have been 11.7 years (the original distribution period, reduced by 1 year). For 2022, if the designated beneficiary is still alive, then the applicable distribution period would be 12.1 years (the 14.1-year life expectancy for a 76-year-old under the Single Life Table in paragraph (b) of this section, reduced by 2 years). However, see section 401(a)(9)(H)(iii) for rules regarding how to apply the required distribution rules to defined contribution plans if the eligible designated beneficiary dies prior to distribution of the employee's entire interest.
