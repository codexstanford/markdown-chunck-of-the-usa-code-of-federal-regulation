##### ยง 404.6334(d)-1 Minimum exemption from levy for wages, salary, or other income.
###### In general.,i.e.

(a)Under section 6331(a), if an individual liable for any tax neglects or refuses to pay such tax within 10 days after notice and demand, the tax may be collected by levy upon property or rights to property belonging to such individual, including amounts payable to or received by him as wages, salary, or other income. Under section 6331(d)(3), a levy upon wages or salary is continuous from the date the levy is first made until the liability giving rise to the levy is satisfied or becomes unforceable by reason of lapse of time. Under section 6334(a)(9), however, certain amounts payable to or received by an individual as wages or salary for personal services, or as income from other sources, are exempt from levy. Under section 6334(d), amounts so exempt are determined by taking into account (1) the individual's payroll period,, the basis (whether weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly or otherwise) on which the individual is paid or receives wages, salary, or other income, and (2) the number of certain other persons dependent upon the individual for their support during each such payroll period. Paragraph (b) of this section prescribes rules for determining an individual's payroll period. Paragraph (c) of this section contains rules relating to the minimum amount of wages, salary, or other income which is exempt from levy for each such payroll period, and the additional amount which is exempt for each person who is claimed as a dependent of the individual pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
