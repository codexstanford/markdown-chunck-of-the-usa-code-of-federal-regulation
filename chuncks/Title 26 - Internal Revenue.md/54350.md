(ii)P's sale of its interest in DE1is a triggering event under § 1.1503(d)-6(e)(1)(iv) and (v). However, if P and T comply with the requirements under § 1.1503(d)-6(f)(2)(iii), the sale would qualify for the multiple-party event exception under § 1.1503(d)-6(f)(2)(i). In addition, because the $100x loss of DE1carries forward to subsequent years for Country X purposes and is available to offset income of DE1, there would be a foreign use of the dual consolidated loss immediately after the sale pursuant to § 1.1503(d)-3(a)(1). This is the case because the dual consolidated loss would be available to offset or reduce income that is considered, under U.S. tax principles, to be an item of FS, a foreign corporation (it would also be a foreign use because FSis an indirect owner of an interest in a hybrid entity that is not a separate unit). However, there is no foreign use in this case as a result of FS's 5 percent interest in DE1pursuant to § 1.1503(d)-3(c)(8).
