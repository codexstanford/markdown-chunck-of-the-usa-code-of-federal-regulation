(2) The gross income from mining for each short ton of quartzite or clay mined by the taxpayer and used by him in the production of all refractory products sold during the taxable year shall be equal to 87percent of the lesser of:

(i) The average lowest published or advertised price, or

(ii) The average lowest actual selling price at which the mine owner or operator offered to sell or sold any such quartzite or clay during the taxable year.
