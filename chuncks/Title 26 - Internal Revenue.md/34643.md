####### ii,Example 26

() When using the rules of UDITPA to estimate the income that would have been taxable by state A in these facts, foreign source income is excluded by starting with federally defined taxable income (before deduction for state income taxes) and subtracting any income derived by USP's Country Y branch. The hypothetical state A taxable income is then determined by multiplying the resulting difference by the average of USP's state A property, payroll, and sales ratios, determined using the principles of UDITPA (after adjustment by eliminating the Country Y branch factors). The resulting product is presumed to be exclusively U.S. source income, and the allocation and apportionment method described in paragraph (g)(26) of this section () must then be applied.
