####### foreign income

(25) The termmeans, with respect to a foreign income tax, the taxable income (or loss) reflected on a foreign tax return (as properly amended or adjusted), even if the taxable income (or loss) is reported by an entity that is a fiscally transparent entity for purposes of the foreign income tax. If, however, foreign law imposes tax on the combined income (within the meaning of ยง 1.901-2(f)(3)(ii)) of two or more foreign payors, foreign income means the combined taxable income (or loss) of such foreign payors, regardless of whether such income (or loss) is reflected on a single foreign tax return.
