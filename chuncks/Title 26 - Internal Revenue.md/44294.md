###### ยง 1.1038-1 Reacquisitions of real property in satisfaction of indebtedness.
####### Holding period of reacquired property.

(3)Since the reacquisition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is in a sense considered a nullification of the original sale of the real property, for purposes of determining gain or loss on a disposition of such property after its reacquisition the period for which the seller has held the real property at the time of such disposition shall include the period for which such property is held by him prior to the original sale. However, the holding period shall not include the period of time commencing with the date following the date on which the property is originally sold to the purchaser and ending with the date on which the property is reacquired by the seller. The period for which the property was held by the seller prior to the original sale shall be determined as provided in ยง 1.1223-1. For example, if under paragraph (a) of ยง 1.1223-1 real property, which was acquired as the result of an involuntary conversion, has been held for five months on January 1, 1965, the date of its sale, and such property is reacquired on July 2, 1965, and resold on July 3, 1965, the seller will be considered to have held such property for five months and one day for purposes of this subparagraph.
