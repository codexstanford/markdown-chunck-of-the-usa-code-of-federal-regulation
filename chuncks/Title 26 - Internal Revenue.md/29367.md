###### ยง 1.527-6 Inclusion of certain amounts in the gross income of an exempt organization which is not a political organization.
####### Separate segregated fund.

(f)An organization or fund described in section 527(f)(3) is a separate segregated fund. To avoid the application of paragraph (a) of this section, an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) may, if it is consistent with its exempt status, establish and maintain such a separate segregated fund to receive contributions and make expenditures in a political campaign. If such a fund meets the requirements of ยง 1.527-2(a) (relating to the definition of a political organization), it shall be treated as a political organization subject to the provisions of section 527. A segregated fund established under the Federal Election Campaign Act will continue to be treated as a segregated fund when it engages in exempt function activities as defined in ยง 1.527-2(c), relating to State campaigns.
