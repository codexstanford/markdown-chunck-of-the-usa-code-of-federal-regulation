####### Application of mortality improvement rates.

(D)Under the generational mortality tables described in this paragraph (a)(2), the probability of an individual's death at a particular age in the future is determined as the individual's base mortality rate that applies at that age (that is, the applicable mortality rate from the table set forth in paragraph (d) of this section for that age, gender, and status as an annuitant or a nonannuitant) multiplied by the cumulative mortality improvement factor for the individual's gender and for that age for the period from 2006 through the calendar year in which the individual is projected to reach the particular age. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shows how the base mortality tables in paragraph (d) of this section and the mortality improvement rates for valuation dates occurring during 2018 are combined to determine projected mortality rates.
