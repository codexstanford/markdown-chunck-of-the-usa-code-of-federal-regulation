###### Determination of net unrealized appreciation.

(2)(i) The amount of net unrealized appreciation in securities of the employer corporation which are distributed by the trust is the excess of the market value of such securities at the time of distribution over the cost or other basis of such securities to the trust. Thus, if a distribution consists in part of securities which have appreciated in value and in part of securities which have depreciated in value, the net unrealized appreciation shall be considered to consist of the net increase in value of all of the securities included in the distribution. For this purpose, two or more distributions made by a trust to a distributee in a single taxable year of the distributee shall be treated as a single distribution.

(ii) For the purpose of determining the net unrealized appreciation on a distributed security of the employer corporation, the cost or other basis of such security to the trust shall be computed in accordance with whichever of the following rules is applicable:

(A) If a security was earmarked for the account of a particular employee at the time it was purchased by or contributed to the trust so that the cost or other basis of such security to the trust is reflected in the account of such employee, such cost or other basis shall be used.

(B) If as of the close of each taxable year of the trust (or other specified period of time not in excess of 12 consecutive calendar months) the trust allocates among the accounts of participating employees all securities acquired by the trust during the period (exclusive of securities unallocated under a plan providing for allocation in whole shares only), the cost or other basis to the trust of any securities allocated as of the close of a particular allocation period shall be the average cost or other basis to the trust of all securities of the same type which were purchased or otherwise acquired by the trust during such allocation period. For purposes of determining the average cost to the trust of securities included in a subsequent allocation, the actual cost to the trust of the securities unallocated as of the close of a prior allocation period shall be deemed to be the average cost or other basis to the trust of securities of the same type allocated as of the close of such prior allocation period.
