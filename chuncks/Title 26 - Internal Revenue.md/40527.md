##### controlled foreign corporations
###### § 1.953-5 Corporations not qualifying as insurance companies.
####### In general.

(a)A controlled foreign corporation is not excluded from the application of paragraph (a) of § 1.953-1 because such corporation, if it were a domestic corporation, would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies. Thus, if a controlled foreign corporation reinsures or issues insurance or annuity contracts in connection with United States risks, as defined in § 1.953-2 or § 1.953-3, and satisfies the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in paragraph (b) of § 1.953-1, such corporation may derive income from the insurance of United States risks even though the primary and predominant business activity of such corporation during the taxable year is not the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies.
