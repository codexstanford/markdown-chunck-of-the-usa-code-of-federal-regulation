###### ยง 1.468A-5 Nuclear decommissioning fund - miscellaneous provisions.
####### Qualification requirements,In general.

(a)-(1)(i) A nuclear decommissioning fund must be established and maintained at all times in the United States pursuant to an arrangement that qualifies as a trust under State law. Such trust must be established for the exclusive purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of one or more nuclear power plants, but a single trust agreement may establish multiple funds for such purpose. Thus, for example-

(A) Two or more nuclear decommissioning funds can be established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement; and

(B) One or more funds that are to be used for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant and that do not qualify as nuclear decommissioning funds under this paragraph (a) can be established and maintained pursuant to a trust agreement that governs one or more nuclear decommissioning funds.

(ii) A separate nuclear decommissioning fund is required for each electing taxpayer and for each nuclear power plant with respect to which an electing taxpayer possesses a qualifying interest. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will issue a separate schedule of ruling amounts with respect to each nuclear decommissioning fund, and each nuclear decommissioning fund must file a separate income tax return even if other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are established and maintained pursuant to the trust agreement governing such fund or the assets of other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are pooled with the assets of such fund.
