####### Granting of request required.

(C)A partnership must consent to reduce its partners' shares of inside basis with respect to a discharged indebtedness if consent is requested with respect to that indebtedness by partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more than 80 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership or five or fewer partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership. For example, if there is a cancellation of partnership indebtedness that is secured by real property used in a partnership's trade or business, and if partners owning (in the aggregate) 90 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership elect to exclude the COD income under section 108(c), the partnership must make the appropriate reductions in those partners' shares of inside basis.
