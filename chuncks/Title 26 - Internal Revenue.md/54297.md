(ii)As a result of the transfer of assets from P to FS, a portion of the year 1 dual consolidated loss is available for a foreign use. This is the case because a portion of the basis in FB's assets, which gave rise to depreciation deductions that were taken into account in computing the year 1 dual consolidated loss, will give rise to a depreciation deduction under Country X laws that will be available, under U.S. tax principles, to offset the income of FS, a foreign corporation, in year 2. However, the aggregate adjusted basis of all the assets transferred by P to FS, within the 12-month period ending at the end of year 2, is less than 10 percent of the aggregate adjusted basis of all of FB's assets at the beginning of such 12-month period. Moreover, the aggregate adjusted basis of the assets transferred by P to FSat any time during the certification period is less than 30 percent of the aggregate adjusted basis of FB's assets held at the end of year 1. In addition, the item of deduction giving rise to the foreign use is being made available solely as a result of the adjusted basis of the transferred assets being determined in whole, or in part, by reference to the adjusted basis of such transferred assets in the hands of FB. As a result, this transfer will not result in a foreign use pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(6).
