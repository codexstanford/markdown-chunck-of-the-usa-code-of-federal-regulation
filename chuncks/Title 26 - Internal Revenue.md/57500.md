(10)The termmeans any notice of a transfer of title to, possession of, or legal ownership of a life insurance contract received by a 6050Y(b) issuer that includes foreign indicia, including information provided for nontax purposes such as a change of address notice for purposes of sending statements or for other purposes, and information relating to loans, premiums, or death benefits with respect to the contract, unless the 6050Y(b) issuer knows that no transfer of the contract has occurred or knows that the transferee is a United States person. For this purpose, a 6050Y(b) issuer may rely on a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, or a valid substitute form that meets the requirements of ยง 1.1441-1(d)(2) (substituting "6050Y(b) issuer" for "withholding agent"), that indicates the transferee is a United States person. For instance, a change of address notice that changes the address to a foreign address or other updates to the information relating to the payment of premiums that includes foreign banking or other foreign financial institution information is notice of a transfer to a foreign person unless the 6050Y(b) issuer knows that no transfer has occurred or the transferee is a United States person.
