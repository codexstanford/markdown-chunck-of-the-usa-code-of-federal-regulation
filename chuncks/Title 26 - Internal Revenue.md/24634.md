####### Performance obligation.,performance obligation

(11)The termmeans a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer to the customer a distinct good, service, or right; or a series of distinct goods, services, or rights, or a combination thereof, that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. A performance obligation includes a promise to grant or transfer a right to use or access intangible property. Performance obligations in a contract are identified by applying the accounting standards the taxpayer uses to prepare its AFS. Additionally, to the extent the contract with the customer provides the taxpayer with an enforceable right to payment, the revenue from which is not allocated to a performance obligation described in the first two sentences of this paragraph (a)(11) in the taxpayer's AFS but is accounted for as a separate source of revenue in the taxpayer's AFS, such right shall be treated as a separate performance obligation under this section. A fee described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section is an example of an enforceable right that is treated as a separate performance obligation.
