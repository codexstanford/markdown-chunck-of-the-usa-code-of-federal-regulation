####### In general.

(1)A testing period for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and 1.1502-98 may include a period beginning before June 25, 1999. Thus, for example, in applying § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i)(relating to the determination of an ownership change of a loss group), the determination of the lowest percentage of ownership interest of any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent during a testing period ending on a testing date occurring on or after June 25, 1999 takes into account the period beginning before June 25, 1999, except to the extent that the period is more than 3 years before the testing date or is otherwise before the beginning of the testing period. See § 1.1502-92(b)(1).
