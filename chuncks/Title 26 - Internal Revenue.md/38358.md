####### Example 3.,Example 1

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in), except that CFC3 pays both a $100x interest payment and a $50x dividend to CFC2, and CFC2 owns 80% (by vote and value) of CFC3. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, CFC2 and CFC3 are related look-through entities, because CFC2 owns more than 50% (by vote and value) of CFC3. Therefore, look-through principles apply to both the interest and dividend income paid or accrued by CFC3 to CFC2, and CFC2 treats both types of income as general category income because CFC3 does not have any passive category earnings. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section and ยง 1.904-4, the resulting subpart F inclusions are general category income to USP and V.
