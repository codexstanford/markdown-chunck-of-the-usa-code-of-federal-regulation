####### Analysis with respect to other income.

(3)(i) A's taxable income and pre-credit U.S. tax liability with respect to A's other income is computed as follows:

(ii) A must compute a separate limitation on the credit for the foreign withholding taxes paid with respect to A's other foreign source passive category taxable income. Under ยง 1.962-1(b)(2)(iv)(B), A's section 904 limitation on this income is computed on the basis of A's taxable income other than the amounts taken into account under ยง 1.962-1(b)(1)(i). Accordingly, $250,000 of A's deductions ($1,000,000 x $1,000,000/$4,000,000) are apportioned to A's $1,000,000 of other foreign source passive category gross income, and $750,000 of deductions ($1,000,000 x $3,000,000/$4,000,000) are apportioned to A's $3,000,000 of U.S. source gross income, resulting in $750,000 of other foreign source passive category taxable income and $2,250,000 of U.S. source taxable income A computes the limitation by multiplying A's pre-credit U.S. tax on A's other income of $1,074,988 by the ratio of A's other foreign source passive category taxable income to A's other total taxable income, as follows:

(iii) A may claim a foreign tax credit under section 901 for all $100,000 of the foreign withholding taxes on the other passive income. The U.S. tax on A's $3,000,000 of other taxable income is reduced from $1,074,988 to $974,988 ($1,074,88 minus $100,000).
