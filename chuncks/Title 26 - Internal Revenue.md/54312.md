####### Result.

(ii)Section 1.1503(d)-4(d)(1)(ii) provides that the dual consolidated loss attributable to a separate unit that is subject to the domestic use limitation under ยง 1.1503(d)-4(b) is eliminated if the separate unit ceases to be a separate unit of its affiliated domestic owner and all other members of the affiliated domestic owner's separate group. As a result of the transfer of the Country X separate unit to FS, the Country X separate unit ceases to be a separate unit of S, and is not a separate unit of any other member of the P consolidated group. In addition, the exceptions in ยง 1.1503(d)-4(d)(2)(iii) do not apply because FSis not a domestic corporation. Thus, the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to the Country X separate unit is eliminated.
