(1) The termmeans any person (other than a person who is required to report a transaction under section 6043), U.S. or foreign, that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business during the calendar year, stands ready to effect sales to be made by others. A broker includes an obligor that regularly issues and retires its own debt obligations or a corporation that regularly redeems its own stock. However, with respect to a sale (including a redemption or retirement) effected at an office outside the United States, a broker includes only a person described as a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman in ยง 1.6049-5(c)(5). In addition, a broker does not include an international organization described in ยง 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) that redeems or retires an obligation of which it is the issuer.
