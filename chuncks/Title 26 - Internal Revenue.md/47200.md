() Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's income that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $60x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's income ($120x) multiplied by 50% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $600x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,200x); and $100x, which is F1's proportionate share of the income of F2 that is treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of F2's income, $100x is treated as non-passive, and $20x is treated as passive.
