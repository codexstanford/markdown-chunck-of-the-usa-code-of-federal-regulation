####### Minimum distance.

(2)For purposes of applying the minimum distance requirement of section 217(c)(1) all taxpayers are divided into one or the other of the following categories: taxpayers having a former principal place of work, and taxpayers not having a former principal place of work. In this latter category are individuals who are seeking full-time employment for the first time (for example, recent high school or college graduates), or individuals who are re-entering the labor force after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment.

(i) In the case of a taxpayer having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(A) provides that no deduction is allowable unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his former residence exceeds by at least 20 miles the distance between his former principal place of work and such former residence.

(ii) In the case of a taxpayer not having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(B) provides that no deduction is allowable unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his former residence is at least 20 miles.

(iii) For purposes of measuring distances under section 217(c)(1) all computations are to be made on the basis of a straight-line measurement.
