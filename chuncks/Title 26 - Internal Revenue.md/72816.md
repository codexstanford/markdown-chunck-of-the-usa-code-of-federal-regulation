####### ยง 301.6222-1 Partner's return must be consistent with partnership return.
######## Partner protected only to extent of notification.

(3)A partner who reports the inconsistent treatment of a partnership-related item is not subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section only with respect to those items identified in the statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Thus, if a partner notifying the IRS with respect to one partnership-related item does not report the inconsistent treatment of another partnership-related item, the IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the unidentified, inconsistently reported item on the partner's return to make it consistent with the treatment of such item on the partnership return and assess the resulting underpayment of tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
