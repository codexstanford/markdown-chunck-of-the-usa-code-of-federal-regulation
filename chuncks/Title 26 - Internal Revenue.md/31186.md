() Income may be distributed among a testator's children or accumulated and added to corpus until the youngest child is 21, when the corpus is to be distributed to the testator's then living descendants. Upon termination of the trust, the corpus is distributed to A, age 21; B, age 23; and C, the child of a deceased child, age 3. The distributions to A and C are not accumulation distributions. The distribution to B is an accumulation distribution to the extent of income accumulated after he reaches 21. (If the terms of the trust were such that it was subject to the separate share treatment under section 663(c), the distribution to B would be an accumulation distribution only to the extent of income accumulated for B's separate share since he reached 21.)
