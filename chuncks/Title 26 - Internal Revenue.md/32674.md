####### Results.

(ii)(A) PRS1 is a section 721(c) partnership.

(B) With respect to year 4, under ยง 1.721(c)-5(b)(5), the sale is a termination event because, as a result of CFC1's sale of its interest, PRS1 will no longer have a partner that is a related foreign person, and there is no plan for a related foreign person to subsequently become a partner in PRS1 (or a successor). Thus, under ยง 1.721(c)-5(b)(1), the trademark is no longer subject to the gain deferral method.
