####### Treatment of unit investment trust.

(b)A unit investment trust shall not be treated as an individual, a trust estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, a unit investment trust is not a taxpayer subject to taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. No gain or loss will be recognized by the unit investment trust if such trust distributes a holder's proportionate share of the trust assets in exchange for his interest in the trust. Also, no gain or loss will be recognized by the unit investment trust if such trust sells the holder's proportionate share of the trust assets and distributes the proceeds from such share to the holder in exchange for his interest in the trust.
