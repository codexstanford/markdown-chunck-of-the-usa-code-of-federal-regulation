####### Deemed elections.

(4)A dealer (including a person who is a dealer as a result of the recharacterization of transactions as sales) is deemed to have elected the installment method if the dealer treats a sale on the installment plan as a transaction other than a sale and fails to report the full amount of gain in the year of the sale. For example, if a transaction treated by a dealer as a lease is recharacterized by the Internal Revenue Service as a sale on the installment plan, the dealer will be deemed to have elected the installment method assuming the dealer failed to report the full amount of gain in the year of the transaction.
