###### ยง 1.963-6 Deficiency distribution.
####### Allocation of reduction in tax credit.

(4)If any portion of a deficiency distribution from a corporation which was in a chain or group is paid from earnings and profits of a taxable year other than that in respect of which the election was made, then the minimum distribution toward which such deficiency distribution counts may not be treated as a pro rata minimum distribution for purposes of ยง 1.963-4. Moreover, the amount of the overall United States and foreign income tax with respect to such minimum distribution must satisfy the minimum tax requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i), or paragraph (ii), of ยง 1.963-4, but, if the latter applies, without any reduction and deferral under paragraph (c)(3) of such section of the foreign tax credit allowable under section 901 with respect to the deficiency distribution.
