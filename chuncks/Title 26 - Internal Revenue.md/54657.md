##### Regulations Applying Section 382 With Respect to Testing Dates (and Corporations Joining or Leaving Consolidated Groups) Before June 25, 1999
###### ยง 1.1502-95A Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group generally applicable for corporations ceasing to be members before June 25, 1999.
####### Application in the case of a loss subgroup.

(3)If two or more former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than separately to its members.
