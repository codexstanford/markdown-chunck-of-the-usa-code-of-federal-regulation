()Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, a merger or consolidation of a QOF partnership with another QOF partnership in a transaction to which section 708(b)(2)(A) applies is not an inclusion event under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if, immediately after the merger or consolidation, the resulting partnership is a QOF. The continuing partnership, as determined under ยง 1.708-1(c)(1), becomes subject to section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations to the same extent that the terminated partnership was so subject prior to the transaction, and must allocate and report any gain under section 1400Z-2(b) to the same extent and to the same partners that the terminated partnership would have allocated and reported such items prior to the transaction. Notwithstanding the rules in this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(), the general inclusion rules of paragraph (c) of this section apply to the portion of the transaction that is otherwise treated as a sale or exchange under paragraph (c) of this section.
