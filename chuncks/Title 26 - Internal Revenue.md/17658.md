####### 2,Section 301 distribution from TFD to PRS.

()Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the section 301 distribution received by PRS from TFD is not a disposition (and therefore does not affect the gain recognition agreement) to the extent it is described in section 301(c)(1) or (2). However, under paragraph (n)(2) of this section, to the extent the distribution is described in section 301(c)(3), UST must recognize gain ($30x) under the gain recognition agreement. For this purpose, the amount of the distribution that is described in section 301(c)(3) is determined before taking into account the increase to the basis of the TFD stock under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
