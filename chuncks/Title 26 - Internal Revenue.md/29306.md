####### Allocation.,allocation

(3)The termincludes distributions made by a cooperative association to a patron in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, similar documents, or in any other manner whereby there is disclosed to a patron the dollar amount apportioned on the books of the association for the account of such patron. Thus, a mere credit to the account of a patron on the books of the cooperative association, without disclosure to the patron, is not an allocation.
