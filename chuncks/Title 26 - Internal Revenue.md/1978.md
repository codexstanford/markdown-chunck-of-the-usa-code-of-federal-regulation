##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### ยง 1.46-8 Requirements for taxpayers electing additional one-percent investment credit (TRASOP's).
####### No partial election.

(5)An election to obtain an additional credit applies to a corporation's entire qualified investment for a taxable year. Thus, a corporation may not elect to obtain a partial additional credit for any year's qualified investment. However, the partial disallowance of an additional credit will not result in an election being treated as a partial election. Also, an election by a member of a controlled group of corporations that applies only to the electing member's qualified investment is not a partial election. See ยง 1.46-8(h)(9) with respect to transitional rules for elections made before January 19, 1979.
