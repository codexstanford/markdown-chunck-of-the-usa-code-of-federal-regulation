###### ยง 1.1321-1 Involuntary liquidation of lifo inventories.

(a) Section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 provides as follows:

(b)(1) If, during any taxable year ending after June 30, 1950, and before January 1, 1955, the disruption of normal trade relations between countries, or one or more of the conditions attributable to a state of national preparedness and beyond the control of the taxpayer, as prescribed by section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as modified by section 1321(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, should render it impossible during such period for a taxpayer using the last-in first-out inventory method to have on hand at the close of the taxable year a stock of merchandise in kind and description like that included in the opening inventory for the year, or in a quantity equal to that of the opening inventory, the resulting inventory decrease for the year will be regarded, at the election of the taxpayer, as reflecting an involuntary liquidation subject to replacement. If the taxpayer notifies the Commissioner within the period prescribed below that he intends to effect a replacement of the liquidated stock, in whole or in part, and that he desires to have applied in his case the involuntary liquidation and replacement provisions of section 1321, and if he establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the involuntary character of the liquidation to which his stock has been subjected, effect shall be given, when replacement has been made, in whole or in part, but only to the extent made in taxable years ending before January 1, 1956, to an adjustment of taxable income for the year of liquidation in the amount of the difference between the replacement costs incurred and the original inventory cost of the liquidated base stock inventory that is replaced. The notification is to be given within 6 months after the filing by the taxpayer of his income tax return for the year of the liquidation. However, if the liquidation occurs in a taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, the notification may be given at any time within 3 months after the promulgation of regulations under section 1321, or prior to the expiration of the 6-month period following the filing of the return, whichever expiration date later occurs.

(2) If the replacement costs exceed such inventory costs, the taxable income of the taxpayer otherwise computed for the year of liquidation shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess. If the replacement costs are less than the inventory costs, taxable income otherwise computed for the year of liquidation shall be increased to the extent of such difference. Any deficiency in the income or excess profits tax of the taxpayer, or any overpayment of such taxes, attributable to such adjustment shall be assessed and collected or credited or refunded to the taxpayer without interest.
