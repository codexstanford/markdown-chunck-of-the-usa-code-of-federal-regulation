####### Example 10.,Example 9

(10)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (f)(9) of this section (), except that on June 30, 2024, GP contributes an additional $5,000 cash to GP prior to GP's sale of its interest in 2025. Immediately after the contribution of the $5,000 on June 30, 2024, GP's interest in PRS has a value of $15,000, not taking into account the value of GP's profits interest in PRS. GP calculates its holding period in the portions not comprised by the profits interest and two-thirds of its holding period runs from June 30, 2020, and one-third runs from June 30, 2024. On June 30, 2025, GP sells its interest for $30,000 and the API has a fair market value of $15,000. Accordingly, on the date of disposition, one-third of GP's interest has a five year holding period from its interest received in 2020 for its $10,000 contribution, one-half of GP's interest has a two year holding period from the profits interest issued on June 30, 2023, and one-sixth of GP's interest has a one year holding period from the contribution of the $5,000.
