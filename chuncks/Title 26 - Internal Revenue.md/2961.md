Furthermore, the net long-term capital gain of an estate or trust does not include capital gains described in section 642(c)(4). Included in the computation of the taxpayer's capital gains item of tax preference are amounts reportable by the taxpayer as distributive shares of gain or loss from partnerships, estates or trusts, electing small business corporations, common trust funds, etc. See section 58 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the above entities.
