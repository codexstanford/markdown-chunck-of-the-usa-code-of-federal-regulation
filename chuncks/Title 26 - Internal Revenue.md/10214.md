####### In operation before January 1, 1969.

(5)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and section 169 (d), a plant or other property will be considered to be in operation before January 1, 1969, if prior to that date such plant or other property was actually performing the function for which it was constructed or acquired. For example, a papermill which is completed in July 1968, but which is not actually used to produce paper until 1969 would not be considered to be in operation before January 1, 1969. The fact that such plant or other property was only operating at partial capacity prior to January 1, 1969, or was being used as a standby facility prior to such date, shall not prevent its being considered to be in operation before such date.
