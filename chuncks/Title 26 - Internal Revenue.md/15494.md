(iii)Proceeds directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate if, in addition to meeting the conditions described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, () some part of the proceeds is or may be used directly or indirectly for the purpose of furthering his candidacy for selection, nomination, or election to any elective public office, and () they are not received by him in the ordinary course of a trade or business (other than the trade or business of holding public office). Proceeds may so inure whether or not the expenditure sought to be deducted was paid or incurred before the commencement of political activities with respect to the selection, nomination, or election referred to in () of this subdivision, or after such selection, nomination, or election has been made or has taken place. For example, proceeds of an event which may be used by an individual who, under the facts and circumstances at the time of the event, the persons making expenditures in connection therewith generally believe will in the reasonably foreseeable future run for a public office, and which may be used in furtherance of such individual's candidacy, generally will be deemed to inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering such individual's candidacy. Or, as another example, proceeds of an event occurring after an election, which may be used by a candidate in that election to repay loans incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, or in reimbursement of expenses incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, will be deemed to directly or indirectly inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. For purposes of this subdivision, if the proceeds received by a candidate exceed substantially the fair market value of the goods furnished or services rendered by him, the proceeds are not received by the candidate in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
