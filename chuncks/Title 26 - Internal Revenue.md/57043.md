####### Interest received from governmental unit.

(ii)Interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if received as a housing assistance payment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on a mortgage insured under section 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701-1715z (1982 & Supp. 1983)). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) (1) and (2) of this section, interest received on a mortgage is only the excess of interest received on the mortgage over interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit.
