###### § 1.501(r)-2 Failures to satisfy section 501(r).
####### Excusing certain failures if hospital facility corrects and discloses.

(c)A hospital facility's failure to meet one or more of the requirements described in §§ 1.501(r)-3 through 1.501(r)-6 that is neither willful nor egregious shall be excused for purposes of this section if the hospital facility corrects and makes disclosure in accordance with rules set forth by revenue procedure, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a "willful" failure includes a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect, and an "egregious" failure includes only a very serious failure, taking into account the severity of the impact and the number of affected persons. Whether a failure is willful or egregious will be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances. A hospital facility's correction and disclosure of a failure in accordance with the relevant guidance is a factor tending to show that the failure was not willful.
