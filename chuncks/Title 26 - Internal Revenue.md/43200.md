##### Domestic International Sales Corporations
###### ยง 1.992-3 Deficiency distributions to meet qualification requirements.
####### Computation in the case of a failure to meet both tests as a result of a single transaction.

(4)If a corporation fails to meet both the 95 percent of gross receipts test and the 95 percent assets test for a taxable year, and if the corporation holds at the end of such year assets (other than cash or qualified export assets) which were received as proceeds of a sale or exchange during such year which resulted in gross receipts other than qualified export receipts, then the amount of the deficiency distribution required by this paragraph with respect to such sale or exchange and assets held is the larger of the amount required by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to the sale or exchange or the amount required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph with respect to such assets held. Thus, for example, if a corporation sells property which is not a qualified export asset for $100, receives $85 in cash and a note for $15, and derives $25 of taxable income from the sale as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, it must distribute $25. If the provisions of this subparagraph are applied with respect to assets of a DISC (other than qualified export assets), such provisions do not apply to any property received as proceeds from a sale or exchange of such assets.
