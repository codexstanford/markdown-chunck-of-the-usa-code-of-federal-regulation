(c)-(1)Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition by gift. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees. If a disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, paragraph (a) of this section applies to the disposition but the prior understated inclusion is determined by taking into account only section 467 rent and section 467 interest properly allocable to the portion of the property not disposed of by gift.
