###### ยง 1.336-3 Aggregate deemed asset disposition price; various aspects of taxation of the deemed asset disposition.
####### Deemed disposition tax consequences.

(e)Gain or loss on each asset in the deemed asset disposition is computed by reference to the ADADP allocated to that asset. ADADP is allocated in the same manner as is ADSP under ยง 1.338-6. Although deemed disposition tax consequences may increase or decrease ADADP by creating or reducing a tax liability, the amount of the tax liability itself may be a function of the size of the deemed disposition tax consequences. Thus, these determinations may require trial and error computations.
