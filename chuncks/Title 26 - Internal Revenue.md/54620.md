#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Regulations Applying Section 382 With Respect to Testing Dates (and Corporations Joining or Leaving Consolidated Groups) Before June 25, 1999
###### § 1.1502-92A Ownership change of a loss group or a loss subgroup generally applicable for testing dates before June 25, 1999.
####### End of separate tracking of certain losses.

(4)If § 1.1502-96A(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies to a loss subgroup, then, while one or more members that were included in the loss subgroup remain members of the consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to their attributes described in § 1.1502-96A(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (or such a member has an ownership change under § 1.1502-96A(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the loss subgroup has had an ownership change before § 1.1502-96A(a) applies, see § 1.1502-96A(c) for the continuing application of the subgroup's section 382 limitation with respect to its pre-change subgroup attributes.
