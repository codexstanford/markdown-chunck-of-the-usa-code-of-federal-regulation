####### Example 3: Coordination with section 50(a).

(3)The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1). In 2021 and 2022, X claimed the full amount of the ratable share allowed under section 46, or $8,000 per taxable year. X's total allowable ratable share for 2023 through 2025 is $24,000 ($8,000 allowable per taxable year). On November 1, 2023, X disposes of the qualified rehabilitated building. Under section 50(a)(1)(B)(iii), because the period of time between when the qualified rehabilitated building was placed in service is more than two, but less than 3 full years, the applicable recapture percentage is 60%. Based on these facts, X has an increase in tax of $9,600 under section 50(a) ($16,000 of credit claimed in 2021 and 2022 x 0.60) and has $3,200 of credits remaining in each of 2023 through 2025, after forgoing $4,800 in credits in each of the years 2023 through 2025 ($8,000 x 0.60).
