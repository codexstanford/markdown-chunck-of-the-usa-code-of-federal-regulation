(iii)To the extent that an amount of income in a subpart F income group is excluded from the subpart F income of the controlled foreign corporation under section 952(c)(1)(A) or (C), the net income in the subpart F income group that is the denominator of the fraction described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount excluded.
