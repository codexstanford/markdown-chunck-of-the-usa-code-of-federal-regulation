####### Organizations described in more than one clause of section 170(b)(1)(A).

(3)For purposes of this paragraph and section 507(b)(1)(A), the parenthetical term "other than in clauses (vii) and (viii)" shall refer only to an organization that is described only in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vii) or section 170(b)(1)(A) (viii). Thus, an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(i), 170(b)(1)(A)(ii), 170(b)(1)(A)(iii), 170(b)(1)(A)(iv), 170(b)(1)(A)(v), or 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) will not be precluded from being a distributee described in section 507(b)(1)(A) merely because it also appears to meet the description of an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vii) or section 170(b)(1)(A)(viii).
