(4)In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that is applying the asset method, see for example § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) (requiring the application of § 1.861-9T(g) at the level of the controlled foreign corporation) or paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the controlled foreign corporation (and any lower-tier controlled foreign corporations) must characterize stock of a lower-tier 10 percent owned corporation by applying § 1.861-12 and treating the controlled foreign corporation as the relevant taxpayer for such purposes. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that owns stock in one or more lower-tier corporations, in applying the asset method, the first-tier controlled foreign corporation must take into account the stock in the lower-tier corporations. Therefore, the controlled foreign corporation (and any lower-tier controlled foreign corporations) must make basis adjustments in lower-tier 10 percent owned corporations under § 1.861-12(c)(2) for purposes of valuing and characterizing the assets of such controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), the stock of each such lower-tier corporation is characterized by reference to the assets owned during the lower-tier corporation's taxable year that ends during the first-tier controlled foreign corporation's taxable year. The analysis of assets under this paragraph (g)(4) and § 1.861-12 of a controlled foreign corporation that is in a chain of 10 percent owned corporations must begin at the lowest-tier 10 percent owned corporation and proceed up the chain to the first-tier controlled foreign corporation.§ 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii).
