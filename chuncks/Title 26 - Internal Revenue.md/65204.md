####### Employers of domestic workers.

(3)Schedule H (Form 1040), "Household Employment Taxes," is the form prescribed for use by every employer in making a return as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in respect of wages, as defined in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, paid by the employer in any calendar year for domestic service as defined in section 3510. Schedule H (Form 1040) is generally filed as an attachment to an income tax return; however, if the employer does not otherwise have an obligation to file an income tax return, Schedule H (Form 1040) may be filed as a separate return. If, however, the employer is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to make a return on Form 941, "Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return," or under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to make a return on Form 943, "Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return For Agricultural Employees," or under paragraph (a)(5) of this section to make a return on Form 944, "Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return," the employer may choose instead to report wages with respect to domestic workers on such Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. If such wages are included on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, the employer must also include Federal unemployment tax for the employee(s) on Form 940, "Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return," under the provisions of ยง 31.6011(a)-3.
