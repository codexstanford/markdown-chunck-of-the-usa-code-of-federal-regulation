###### ยง 1.482-7A Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a cost sharing arrangement.
####### Failure to assign interests under a qualified cost sharing arrangement.

(6)If a qualified cost sharing arrangement fails to assign an interest in a covered intangible, then each controlled participant will be deemed to hold a share in such interest equal to its share of the costs of developing such intangible. For this purpose, if cost shares have varied materially over the period during which such intangible was developed, then the costs of developing the intangible must be measured by their present discounted value as of the date when the first such costs were incurred.
