(B)() The acquisition of CFC1 gives rise to four separate CAAs under § 1.901(m)-2(b). The acquisition of the stock of CFC1 and the deemed purchase of the stock of CFC2 under section 338(h)(3)(B) are each a section 338 CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1). Furthermore, because the deemed purchase of the assets of DE1 and DE2 for U.S. income tax purposes is disregarded for Country F tax purposes, each acquisition is a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2). Because these four CAAs occur pursuant to a plan, under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(3) they are part of an aggregated CAA transaction. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets and those of DE1 and DE2. CFC2 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 are each a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are the foreign payors (see § 1.901-2(f)(1) and (f)(4)(ii)). CFC2 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which CFC2 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(1)).
