####### Members of a controlled group filing a consolidated return.

(4)If some component members of a controlled group join in filing a consolidated return pursuant to ยง 1.1502-3(a)(3), and other component members do not join, then, unless a consent is timely filed apportioning the $25,000 amount among the group filing the consolidated return and the other component members of the controlled group, each component member of the controlled group (including each component member which joins in filing the consolidated return) shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of equally apportioning the $25,000 amount under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph. In that case, the tax liability limitation for the group filing the consolidated return is computed by substituting for the $25,000 amount under section 46(a)(3) the total amount apportioned to each component member that joins in filing the consolidated return. If the affiliated group filing the consolidated return and the other component members of the controlled group adopt an apportionment plan, the affiliated group shall be treated as a single member for the purpose of applying subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph. Thus, for example, only one consent executed by the common parent to the apportionment plan is required for the group filing the consolidated return. If any component member of the controlled group which joins in the filing of the consolidated return is an organization to which section 593 applies or a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a), see paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of ยง 1.1502-3.
