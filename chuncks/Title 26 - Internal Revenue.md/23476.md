###### § 1.430(h)(3)-2 Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Selection of base table.

(B)If the population consists solely of annuitants, the annuitant base mortality table set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. If the population consists solely of nonannuitants, the nonannuitant base mortality table set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for that purpose. If the population includes both annuitants and nonannuitants, a combination of the annuitant and nonannuitant base tables set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for that purpose. The combined table is constructed using the weighting factors for small plans that are set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d). The weighting factors are applied to develop the combined table using the following equation: Combined mortality rate = [nonannuitant rate * (1 - weighting factor)] + [annuitant rate * weighting factor].
