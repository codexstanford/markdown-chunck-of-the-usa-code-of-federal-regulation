###### ยง 1.1055-1 General rule with respect to redeemable ground rents.
####### Character of a redeemable ground rent.

(a)For purposes of subtitle A of the Code (1) a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c) and paragraph (b) of this section) shall be treated as being in the nature of a mortgage, and (2) real property held subject to liabilities under such a redeemable ground rent shall be treated as held subject to liabilities under a mortgage. Thus, under section 1055(a) and this paragraph, the transfer of property subject to a redeemable ground rent has the same effect as the transfer of property subject to a mortgage, the acquisition of property subject to a redeemable ground rent is to be treated the same as the acquisition of property subject to a mortgage, and the holding of property subject to a redeemable ground rent is to be treated in the same manner as the holding of property subject to a mortgage. See section 163(c) for the treatment of any annual or periodic rental payment under a redeemable ground rent as interest.
