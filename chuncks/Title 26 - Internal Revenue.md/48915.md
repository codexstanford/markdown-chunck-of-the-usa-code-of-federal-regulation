####### Circular movement of consideration.,See

(B)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (this Example 3), except that Entity C contributes the $100 and $75 (received from Individual S) to Corporations C and D, respectively, as part of a plan that includes each transaction described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) (collectively, the transaction series). Under the step transaction doctrine and circular cash flow principles, this circular movement of consideration is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Therefore, the transaction series is treated for Federal income tax purposes as a contribution by Individual S of Assets 1 and 2 to Entity C in exchange for an eligible interest in Entity C, followed by a contribution by Entity C of Assets 1 and 2 to Corporations C and D, respectively. This result also would obtain if Individual S were not related to Entity C immediately following Individual S's acquisition of its eligible interest from Entity C.Rev.
