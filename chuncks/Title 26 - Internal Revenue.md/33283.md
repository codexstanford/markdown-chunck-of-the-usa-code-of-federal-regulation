###### ยง 1.807-4 Adjustment for change in computing reserves.
####### Example 1,Facts.

(1)-(i)In 2021, IC changed the basis of computing the amount of life insurance reserves for a certain type of life insurance contract as described in section 807(f). Both the basis used for computing the reserves for the relevant contracts at the close of the 2020 taxable year (old basis) and the basis of computing the reserves for the relevant type of contract at the close of the 2021 taxable year (new basis) are consistent with the applicable Commissioners' Reserve Valuation Method. IC followed the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner to obtain consent to change the basis of computing these reserves. IC determined that the life insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021, for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 were $110x if computed using the old method and $120x if computed using the new method. IC also determined that the life insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021, for the relevant contracts issued during 2021 were $15x using the new basis.
