####### Effect of qualified deficits.

(ii)Neither an accumulated deficit nor any prior year deficit in the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation reduces its net income in a subpart F income group. Accordingly, any such deficit does not affect the denominator of the fraction described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. However, the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) does not affect the application of section 952(c)(1)(B) for purposes of determining the domestic corporation's subpart F inclusion. Any reduction to the domestic corporation's subpart F inclusion under section 952(c)(1)(B) is reflected in the numerator of the fraction described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
