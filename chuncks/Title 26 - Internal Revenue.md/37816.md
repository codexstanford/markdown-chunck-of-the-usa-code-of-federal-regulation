###### ยง 1.901(m)-3 Disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover.
####### Amount of aggregate basis difference carryover.

(2)(i) If a section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is zero, all of the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference (positive or negative) for the U.S. taxable year gives rise to an aggregate basis difference carryover to the next U.S. taxable year.

(ii) If a section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is not zero, then aggregate basis difference carryover can arise in either or both of the following two situations:

(A) If a section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference for the U.S. taxable year exceeds its allocable foreign income, the excess gives rise to an aggregate basis difference carryover.

(B) If the tentative disqualified tax amount exceeds the disqualified tax amount, the excess tentative disqualified tax amount is converted into aggregate basis difference carryover by multiplying such excess by a fraction, the numerator of which is the allocable foreign income, and the denominator of which is the sum of the foreign income tax amount and the FCCTs that are paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor.
