###### § 1.6049-4 Return of information as to interest paid and original issue discount includible in gross income after December 31, 1982.
####### Original issue discount.,b,1,d,a,2

(2)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section, in the case of original issue discount, an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099 shall be made for each calendar year of any holder of an obligation as to which there is original issue discount includible in gross income aggregating $10 or more. For calendar years before 1992, semiannual record date reporting under § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)()() may be used, and if it is used, the original issue discount includible in gross income is determined by treating each holder as holding the obligation on every day it was outstanding during the calendar year. An information return shall be made, however, in any case in which an amount of tax is required to be deducted and withheld under section 3406. In such case, the amount required to be reported is the amount subject to withholding even if the amount of original issue discount includible in gross income is less than $10. With respect to an obligation described in § 1.1232-3A (e) or (f) (relating respectively to deposits in banks and similar financial institutions and to face-amount certificates), § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)() and the last sentence of § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)()() shall apply. The information return shall show:

(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each record holder for whom an amount of original issue discount is includible in gross income;

(ii) The account, serial, or other identifying number of each obligation with respect to which a return is being made;
