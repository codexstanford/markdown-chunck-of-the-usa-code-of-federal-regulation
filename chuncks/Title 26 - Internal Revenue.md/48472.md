###### ยง 1.1400Z2(a)-1 Deferring tax on capital gains by investing in opportunity zones.
####### Example 3. Net capital gain from section 1256 contracts.

(iii)For 2019, taxpayer D had $100 of net capital gain realized from section 1256 contracts that is eligible gain under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B) of this section. D timely invested $100 in a QOF and properly made an election under section 1400Z-2 to defer that $100 of gain. In 2023, section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b) requires D to include that deferred gain in gross income. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the character of the inclusion is governed by section 1256(a)(3), which requires a 40:60 split between short-term and long-term capital gain. Accordingly, $40 of the inclusion is short-term capital gain and $60 of the inclusion is long-term capital gain.
