####### Analysis.

(B)USP's aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC is $20x, the lesser of $20x, the excess of USP's pro rata share of the average amounts of United States property held by FC ($120x) over the earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) with respect to USP ($100x), and its pro rata share of FC's applicable earnings ($100x). Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC is its aggregate tentative section 956 amount with respect to FC reduced by the deduction under section 245A that USP would be allowed if USP received an amount equal to its aggregate tentative section 956 amount as a distribution with respect to the FC stock. USP would be allowed a $20x deduction under section 245A with respect to the foreign-source portion of the $20x hypothetical distribution, which, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, is treated as attributable to the earnings and profits of FC described in section 959(c)(3) despite the fact that FC has $100x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) that would otherwise be distributed before earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). Accordingly, USP's section 956 amount with respect to FC is $0, its aggregate tentative section 956 amount ($20x) with respect to FC reduced by the amount of the deduction that USP would have been allowed under section 245A with respect to the hypothetical distribution after applying the rule in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section ($20x).
