Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability for bonds in a transaction in which any unamortized discount or premium attributable to such bonds carried over to such corporation, then the acquiring corporation assuming liability for the bonds shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium.
