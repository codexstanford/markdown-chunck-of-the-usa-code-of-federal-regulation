####### Sales or services of controlled parties,In general.

(4)-(i)For purposes of the apportionment within a class under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if the controlled party is reasonably expected to (through a license, sale, or transfer): Acquire intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R&E expenditures; acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property, then the gross receipts of the controlled party from all of its sales, licenses, leases, or services are taken into account. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, if the taxpayer has previously licensed, sold, or transferred intangible property related to a SIC code category to a controlled party, the taxpayer is presumed to expect to license, sell, or transfer to that controlled party all future intangible property related to the same SIC code category. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer with facts that demonstrate that the taxpayer will not license, sell, or transfer future intangible property to the controlled party.
