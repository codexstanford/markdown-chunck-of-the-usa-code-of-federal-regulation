(D)() In all other cases, there shall be used the average cost (or other basis) to the trust of all securities of the employer corporation of the type distributed to the distributee which the trust has on hand at the time of the distribution, or which the trust had on hand on a specified inventory date which date does not precede the date of distribution by more than twelve calendar months. If a distribution includes securities of the employer corporation of more than one type, the average cost (or other basis) to the trust of each type of security distributed shall be determined. The average cost to the trust of securities of the employer corporation on hand on a specified inventory date (or on hand at the time of distribution) shall be computed on the basis of their actual cost, considering the securities most recently purchased to be those on hand, or by means of a moving average calculated by subtracting from the total cost of securities on hand immediately preceding a particular sale or distribution an amount computed by multiplying the number of securities sold or distributed by the average cost of all securities on hand preceding such sale or distribution.
