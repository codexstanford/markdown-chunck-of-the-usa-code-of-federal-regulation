###### ยง 1.301-1 Rules applicable with respect to distributions of money and other property.
####### Transactions treated as distributions.

(j)A distribution to shareholders with respect to their stock is within the terms of section 301, although it takes place at the same time as another transaction, if the distribution is in substance a separate transaction (whether or not connected in a formal sense). This situation is most likely to occur in the case of a recapitalization, a reincorporation, or a merger of a corporation with a newly organized corporation having substantially no property. For example, if a corporation having only common stock outstanding exchanges one share of newly issued common stock and one bond with a principal amount of $10 for each share of outstanding common stock, the distribution of the bond will be a distribution of property (to the extent of its fair market value) to which section 301 applies, even though the exchange of common stock for common stock may be pursuant to a plan of reorganization under the terms of section 368(a)(1)(E) (recapitalization) and may result in the shareholder not recognizing any gain or loss on the exchange by reason of section 354.
