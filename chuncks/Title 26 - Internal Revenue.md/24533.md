####### Example.

(B)Taxpayer A, a C corporation, is a plumbing contractor that installs plumbing fixtures in customers' homes or businesses. A's gross receipts for the 2017-2019 taxable years are $20 million, $16 million, and $30 million, respectively. A's average annual gross receipts for the three taxable-year period preceding the 2020 taxable year is $22 million (($20 million + $16 million + $30 million)/3) = $22 million. A may use the cash method for its trade or business for the 2020 taxable year because its average annual gross receipts for the preceding three taxable years is not more than the gross receipts test amount of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, which is $26 million for 2020.
