##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### § 1.47-1 Recomputation of credit allowed by section 38.
####### Special rule.

(2)Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, if a taxpayer uses an averaging convention (see § 1.167(a)(10)) in computing depreciation with respect to section 38 property, then, for purposes of this section and §§ 1.47-2 through 1.47-6, he may use the assumed dates of additions and retirements in determining the actual useful life of such property provided such assumed dates are used consistently for purposes of subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code with respect to all section 38 property for which such convention is used for purposes of depreciation. This subparagraph shall not apply in any case where from all the facts and circumstances it appears that the use of such assumed dates results in a substantial distortion of the investment credit allowed by section 38. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer computes depreciation under a convention under which the average of the beginning and ending balances of the asset account for the taxable year are taken into account, he may use July 1 as the assumed date of all additions and retirements to such account. Similarly, if the taxpayer computes depreciation under a convention under which the average of the beginning and ending balances of the asset account for each month is taken into account, he may use the date determined by reference to the weighted average of the monthly averages as the assumed date of all additions and retirements to such account.
