####### Rate set in arrears.

(ii)If the amount of a periodic payment is not determinable at the end of a taxable year because the value of the specified index is not fixed until a date that occurs after the end of the taxable year, the ratable daily portion of a periodic payment that relates to that taxable year is generally based on the specified index that would have applied if the specified index were fixed as of the last day of the taxable year. If a taxpayer determines that the value of the specified index as of the last day of the taxable year does not provide a reasonable estimate of the specified index that will apply when the payment is fixed, the taxpayer may use a reasonable estimate of the specified index each year, provided that the taxpayer (and any related person that is a party to the contract) uses the same method to make the estimate consistently from year to year and uses the same estimate for purposes of all financial reports to equity holders and creditors. The taxpayer's treatment of notional principal contracts with substantially similar specified indices will be considered in determining whether the taxpayer's estimate of the specified index is reasonable. Any difference between the amount that is recognized under this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) and the corresponding portion of the actual payment that becomes fixed under the contract is taken into account as an adjustment to the net income or net deduction from the notional principal contract for the taxable year during which the payment becomes fixed.
