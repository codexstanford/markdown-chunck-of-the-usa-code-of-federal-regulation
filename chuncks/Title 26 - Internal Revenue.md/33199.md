####### Insurance company.,insurance company

(a)(1) The termmeans a company whose primary and predominant business activity during the taxable year is the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies. Thus, though its name, charter powers, and subjection to State insurance laws are significant in determining the business which a company is authorized and intends to carry on, it is the character of the business actually done in the taxable year which determines whether a company is taxable as an insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code.

(2) Insurance companies include both stock and mutual companies, as well as mutual benefit insurance companies. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, a voluntary unincorporated association of employees, including an association fulfilling the requirements of section 801(b)(2)(B) (as in effect for such years), formed for the purpose of relieving sick and aged members and the dependents of deceased members, is an insurance company, whether the fund for such purpose is created wholly by membership dues or partly by contributions from the employer. A corporation which merely sets aside a fund for the insurance of its employees is not an insurance company, and the income from such fund shall be included in the return of the corporation.
