(ii). (A) The facts are the same as in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section (), except LLC also holds real property worth $475,000 subject to a $200,000 liability. Additionally, LLC reasonably projects to earn $20,000 of net rental income per year from such real property.

(B) Because LLC is a disregarded entity, A is treated as the partner in LP for federal income tax purposes. Only LLC has an obligation to make a payment on account of the $300,000 debt if LP were to constructively liquidate as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, paragraph (k) of this section is applied to the LLC and not to A. Because there is a commercially reasonable expectation that LLC will be able to satisfy its payment obligation, LLC's obligation to restore its deficit capital account is recognized under paragraph (b) of this section. As a result, LP's $300,000 debt is characterized as recourse under ยง 1.752-1(a)(1) and is allocated to A under ยง 1.752-2.
