####### Effect of the QOF partnership election.

(B)As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated as a QOF partnership from day one. Consequently, the consolidated group must file amended or superseding returns, as applicable, to account for the electing QOF partnership's income, gain, deduction, and loss; the electing QOF partnership also must file its own partnership returns for taxable periods beginning on day one, as applicable. The electing QOF partnership must include its self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a) with its own returns, and the self-certification will be treated as timely so long as the consolidated group filed a timely self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a) for the pre-existing QOF sub. In addition, appropriate adjustments must be made to account for the change in status of the electing QOF partnership from day one, including modifications to investment adjustments to the basis in members' stock made under § 1.1502-32 and adjustments to members' earnings and profits made under § 1.1502-33.
