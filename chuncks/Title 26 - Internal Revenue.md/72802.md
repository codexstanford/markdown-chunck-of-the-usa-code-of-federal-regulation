######## Example 2.

(ii)B is a partner in Partnership during 2018. Partnership incurred start-up costs before it was actively engaged in its business. Partnership capitalized these costs on its 2018 partnership return. B deducted his distributive share of the start-up costs on B's 2018 income tax return. B has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because B's treatment of the start-up costs is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by Partnership on its partnership return.
