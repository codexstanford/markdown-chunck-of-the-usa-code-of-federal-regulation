(D)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (q)(2)(xx)(A) of this section (the facts in this), except that, instead of USP selling the TFC stock to X, in year 4 TFC distributes all of its assets to USP in a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply. The result is the same as in paragraph (q)(2)(xx)(B) of this section (the facts in this) because, under the provisions of ยง 1.1502-13, in year 4 UST takes into account the $40x gain (the intercompany item) from the year 3 distribution.
