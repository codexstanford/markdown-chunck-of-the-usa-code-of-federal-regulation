(v)If an insurance company issues or proportionally reinsures an insurance contract, other than a contract described in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, with an effective period that exceeds 12 months, for which the gross premium is payable in installments over the effective period of the contract, the company may treat the insurance coverage provided under the multi-year contract as a series of separate insurance contracts. The first contract in the series is treated as having been written for an effective period of twelve months. Each subsequent contract in the series is treated as having been written for an effective period equal to the lesser of 12 months or the remainder of the period for which the rates for insurance coverage are guaranteed in the multi-year insurance contract. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting premiums on a multi-year contract only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for each year of the multi-year contract does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that adopts this method of reporting premiums for a multi-year contract must use the method for all multi-year contracts with installment premiums.
