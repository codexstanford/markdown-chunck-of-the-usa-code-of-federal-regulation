(ii)-(A)The R&E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property used for P's website. Accordingly, they are definitely related and allocable to gross intangible income derived directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) from that intangible property. Because P's advertising sales are dependent on the users attracted to its website, P's gross income from advertising is indirectly derived from intangible property and is included in gross intangible income. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 737, which consists of U.S. source income.
