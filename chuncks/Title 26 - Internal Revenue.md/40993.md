####### Termination of designation.

(c)Section 955(c)(3) provides that, after the President has designated any foreign country or possession of the United States as an economically less developed country for purposes of sections 951 through 964, he may not terminate such designation (either by issuing an Executive order for the purpose of terminating such designation or by issuing an Executive order which has the effect of terminating such designation) unless, at least 30 days prior to such termination, he has notified the Senate and the House of Representatives of his intention to terminate such designation. If such 30-day notice is given, no action by the Congress of the United States is necessary to effectuate the termination. The requirement for giving 30-day notice to the Senate and House of Representatives applies also to the termination of a designation with respect to an overseas territory, department, province, or possession of a foreign country. See paragraph (c) of ยง 1.955-2 for the effect of a termination of a Presidential designation upon property which would be a qualified investment in a less developed country but for the fact of such termination.
