####### Liability of withholding agent acting through an agent.

(iii)A withholding agent acting through an agent is liable for any failure of the agent, such as a failure to withhold an amount or make a payment of tax, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure had been the failure of the withholding agent. For this purpose, the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the withholding agent. Except as otherwise provided in the QI, WP, or WT agreement, an agent of a withholding agent is subject to the same withholding and reporting obligations that apply to any withholding agent under the provisions of chapter 4 and does not benefit from the special procedures or exceptions that apply to a QI, WP, or WT. If the agent is a foreign person, however, a U.S. withholding agent may treat the acts of the foreign agent as its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with the provisions of chapter 4. The withholding agent's liability under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will exist even if the agent is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 4. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.
