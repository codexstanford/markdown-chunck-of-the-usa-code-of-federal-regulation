###### ยง 1.901(m)-6 Successor rules.
####### Transfers of a section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to a foreign payor to another foreign payor.

(2)If a section 901(m) payor has an aggregate basis difference carryover, with respect to a foreign income tax and a foreign payor, and substantially all of the assets of the foreign payor are transferred to another foreign payor in which the section 901(m) payor owns an interest, the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the first foreign payor is transferred to the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the other foreign payor. In such a case, the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the first foreign payor is reduced to zero.
