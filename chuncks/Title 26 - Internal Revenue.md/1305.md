(3)In the case of a purchase of a new principal residence which is tied in to the transfer of other property by the seller to the purchaser, whether purportedly by sale or gift, the adjusted basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the excess of the fair market value of such other property received over the amount, if any, purportedly paid for it by the purchaser of the residence. For example, if a taxpayer receives a new car with a fair market value of $2,500 upon the purchase of a condominium apartment for a total purchase price of $40,000 (including settlement costs which are capital in nature) his adjusted basis in the residence for computation of the credit is $37,500.
