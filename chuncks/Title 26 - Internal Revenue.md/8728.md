(e)Section 164(d) and ยง 1.164-6, relating to apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser, do not apply to a sale by the United States or any of its agencies of real property to which section 164(f) and this section apply. Thus, amounts paid or accrued which qualify under paragraph (a) of this section will continue to be deductible as taxes to the extent provided in this section, even in the taxable year in which the owner actually purchases the real property from the United States or any of its agencies. However, the provisions of section 164(d) and ยง 1.164-6 shall apply to a sale of real property to which section 164(f) and this section apply, if the seller is other than the United States or any of its agencies.
