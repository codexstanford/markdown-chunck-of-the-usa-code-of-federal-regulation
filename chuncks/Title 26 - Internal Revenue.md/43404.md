####### Export controlled products,In general.

(h)-(1)An export controlled product is not export property. A product or commodity may be an export controlled product at one time but not an export controlled product at another time. For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity is an "export controlled product" at a particular time if at that time the export of such product or commodity is prohibited or curtailed under section 4(b) of the Export Administration Act of 1969 or section 7(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, to effectuate the policy relating to the protection of the domestic economy set forth in such Acts (paragraph (2)(A) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1969 and paragraph (2)(C) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1979). Such policy is to use export controls to the extent necessary "to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand."
