####### Refund and credit,In general.

(a)-(1)Except to the extent otherwise provided in this section, a refund or credit of tax which has actually been withheld at the source at the time of payment under chapter 4 shall be made to the beneficial owner of the payment to which the amount of withheld tax is attributable if the beneficial owner or payee meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and any other requirements that may be required under chapter 65. To the extent that the amount withheld under chapter 4 is not actually withheld at source, but is later paid by the withholding agent to the IRS, the refund or credit under chapter 65 of the Code shall be made to the withholding agent to the extent the withholding agent provides documentation with respect to the beneficial owner or payee described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section sufficient for the beneficial owner or payee to have obtained a refund of the tax and sufficient for the withholding agent to have applied a reduced rate or exemption from withholding under chapter 4. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a nonparticipating FFI that is acting as a withholding agent with respect to one or more of its account holders. In such a case, only the account holders of the nonparticipating FFI will be entitled to a credit or refund of an amount withheld under chapter 4, to the extent otherwise allowable under this section. Additionally, there are collective refund procedures for a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI to claim a refund or credit on behalf of certain direct account holders that are beneficial owners of the payment under ยง 1.1471-4(h) (in lieu of such account holders claiming refund or credit under this paragraph (a)(1)).
