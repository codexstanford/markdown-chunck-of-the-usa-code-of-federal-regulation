####### Amount attributable to property,General rule.

(g)-(1)For purposes of this section, the amount taken into account under section 955(b)(4) with respect to any property which constitutes a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations shall be its adjusted basis as of the applicable determination date, reduced by the outstanding principal amount of any liability (other than a liability described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) to which such property is subject on such date including a liability secured only by the general credit of the controlled foreign corporation. Liabilities shall be taken into account in the following order:

(i) The adjusted basis of each and every item of corporate property shall be reduced by any specific charge (non-recourse or otherwise) to which such item is subject. For this purpose, if a liability constitutes a specific charge against several items of property and cannot definitely be allocated to any single item of property, the specific charge shall be apportioned against each of such items of property in that ratio which the adjusted basis of such item on the applicable determination date bears to the adjusted basis of all such items on such date. The excess against property over the adjusted basis of such property shall be taken into account as a liability secured only by the general credit of the corporation.

(ii) A liability which is evidenced by an open account or which is secured only by the general credit of the controlled foreign corporation shall be apportioned against each and every item of corporate property in that ratio which the adjusted basis of such item on the applicable determination date (reduced as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) bears to the adjusted basis of all the corporate property on such date (reduced as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph); provided that no liability shall be apportioned under this subdivision against any stock or obligations described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
