(C)-()-()An item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes by reason of the receipt of a remittance by a taxable unit is assigned to the statutory or residual groupings of the recipient taxable unit that correspond to the groupings out of which the payor taxable unit made the remittance under the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)()(). A remittance paid by a taxable unit is considered to be made ratably out of all of the accumulated after-tax income of the taxable unit. The accumulated after-tax income of the taxable unit that pays the remittance is deemed to have arisen in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the assets of the taxable unit are (or would be if the owner of the taxable unit were a United States person) assigned for purposes of apportioning interest expense under the asset method in ยง 1.861-9 in the taxable year in which the remittance is made. See paragraph (g)(11) and (12) of this section (and). If the payor taxable unit is determined to have no assets under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)()() of this section, then the foreign gross income that is included by reason of the receipt of the remittance is assigned to the residual grouping.
