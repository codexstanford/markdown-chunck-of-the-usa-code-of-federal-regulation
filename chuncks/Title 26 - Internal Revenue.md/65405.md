####### Food or beverage operation.

(6)A "food or beverage operation" is any business activity which provides food or beverages for consumption on the premises (other than "fast food" operations). If an employer conducts activities that provide food or beverages at more than one location, the activity at each separate location shall be considered to be a separate food or beverage operation, Each activity conducted within a single building shall be considered to be conducted at a separate location if the customers of the activity, while being provided with food or beverages, occupy an area separate from that occupied by customers of other activities and the gross receipts of the activity are recorded separately from the gross receipts of other activities. For example, a gourmet restaurant, a coffee shop, and a cocktail lounge in a hotel would each be treated as a separate food or beverage operation if gross receipts from each activity are recorded separately. In addition, an employer may treat different activities conducted in the identical place at different times as separate food or beverage operations if the gross receipts of the activities at each time are recorded separately. For example, a restaurant may record the gross receipts from its cafeteria style lunch operation separately from the gross receipts of its full service food or beverage operations.
