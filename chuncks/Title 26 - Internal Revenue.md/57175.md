###### ยง 1.6050K-1 Returns relating to sales or exchanges of certain partnership interests.
####### Partnership not required to make a return or furnish statements under this section until it has notice of the exchange.

(e)A partnership shall not be required to make a return or furnish statements under section 6050K and this section with respect to any section 751(a) exchange until it has been notified of the exchange. For purposes of section 6050K(c)(2) and this section, a partnership is notified of a section 751(a) exchange when either:

(1) The partnership receives the written notification from the transferor required under paragraph (d) of this section; or

(2) The partnership has knowledge that there has been a transfer of a partnership interest or any portion thereof, and, at the time of the transfer, the partnership had any section 751 property. However, no return or statements are required under section 6050K if the transfer was not a section 751(a) exchange (e.g., a transfer which in its entirety constitutes a gift for federal income tax purposes). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), the partnership may rely on a written statement from the transferor that the transfer was not a section 751(a) exchange in the absence of knowledge to the contrary. For rules applicable where the partnership is in doubt as to whether partnership property constitutes section 751 property to any extent or as to whether a transfer of a partnership interest constitutes a section 751(a) exchange, see paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
