###### ยง 1.163(j)-5 General rules governing disallowed business interest expense carryforwards for C corporations.
####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation is increased by $125x to reflect S's tax items for the current year. The P group's section 163(j) limitation permits the P group to deduct all $150x of S's current-year business interest expense. S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation is reduced by the $150x of S's business interest expense absorbed by the P group in the current year, which results in a -$25x balance. Thus, none of S's SRLY'd disallowed business interest expense carryforwards may be deducted by the P group in the current year. Entering the subsequent year, S's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation remains -$25x.
