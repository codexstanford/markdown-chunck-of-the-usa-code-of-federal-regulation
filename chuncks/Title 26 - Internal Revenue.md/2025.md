####### Ceiling on start-up expenses.

(iii)Reimbursement for start-up expenses is limited to a ceiling. This ceiling is the sum of 10 percent of the first $100,000 that an employer is first required to transfer under paragraph (c)(8) of this section for an applicable year and 5 percent of that amount in excess of $100,000. If this first year is an unused credit year from which there is a carryover, amounts required to be transferred in subsequent years for claiming carryovers from this first year are considered in determining this ceiling. Thus, for example, assume that a calendar-year corporation first earns an additional credit in 1977 of $9,000 and that $3,000 of this amount is claimed on the income tax return for 1977, for 1978 and for 1979. The corporation's ceiling on start-up expenses is $300 when its 1977 return is filed. The total ceiling increases to $600 when its 1978 return is filed and to $900 when its 1979 return is filed, with the claiming of an additional $3,000 credit for each of the three years.
