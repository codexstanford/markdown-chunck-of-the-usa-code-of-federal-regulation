()-()For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)() of this section, a dividend from a member of the same expanded group () is not taken into account for purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings, except to the extent the dividend is attributable to earnings and profits accumulated by the distributing member in a taxable year ending after April 4, 2016, during its expanded group period (). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a dividend received from a member () is not taken into account for purposes of calculating the qualified earnings and profits of a distributing member (or another intermediate distributing member), except to the extent the dividend is attributable to qualified earnings and profits of the intermediate distributing member. A dividend from a distributing member or an intermediate distributing member is considered to be attributable to qualified earnings and profits to the extent thereof. If the distributing member or the intermediate distributing member is not a covered member, the expanded group period of the member is determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section. If a controlled partnership receives a dividend from a distributing member and a portion of the dividend is allocated (including through one or more partnerships) to a covered member, then, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(), the covered member is treated as receiving the dividend from the distributing member.
