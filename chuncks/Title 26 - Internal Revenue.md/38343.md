####### Analysis.

(ii)Under the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and ยง 1.954-1(b)(1)(i), none of CFC's income is treated as foreign base company income. All of CFC's income, therefore, is treated as general category income and tested income. In Year 1, USP has a GILTI inclusion amount with respect to CFC. Such amount is section 951A category income to USP.
