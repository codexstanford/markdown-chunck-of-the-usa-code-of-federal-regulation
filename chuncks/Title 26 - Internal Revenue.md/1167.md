####### Analysis.

(ii)Under the rule in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, when the current income-qualified tenant moves to a different unit in the project, the unit to which the tenant moves is eligible for the taxpayer to designate as a unit with a designated imputed income limitation of 40 percent of AMGI. If the taxpayer makes those designations, the unit vacated by the tenant takes on the prior limitation, if any, of the tenant's new unit. In this situation, the vacated unit formerly occupied by the tenant is now a market-rate unit.
