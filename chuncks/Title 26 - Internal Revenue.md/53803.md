###### § 1.1502-91 Application of section 382 with respect to a consolidated group.
####### Business interest expense.,Example

(iii)The facts are the same as in thein paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, except that, rather than a consolidated net operating loss, a member of the L group pays or accrues a business interest expense in Year 1 for which a deduction is disallowed in that year under section 163(j) and § 1.163(j)-2(b). The disallowed business interest expense is carried over to Year 2 under section 163(j)(2) and § 1.163(j)-2(c). Thus, the disallowed business interest expense carryforward is a pre-change loss. Under section 163(j), the L loss group is entitled to deduct the carryforward in Year 2; however, the amount of consolidated taxable income of the L group for Year 2 that may be offset by this carryforward may not exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation of the L group for that year. See § 1.1502-98(b) (providing that §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 apply section 382 to business interest expense, with appropriate adjustments).
