###### ยง 1.897-2 United States real property holding corporations.
####### Controlling interests in corporations.

(3)For purposes only of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, if the corporation (the "first corporation") holds a controlling interest in a second corporation-

(i) The first corporation is treated as holding a proportionate share of each asset (i.e., U.S. real property interests, interests in real property located outside the United States, and assets used or held for use in a trade or business) held by the second corporation, determined in accordance with the rules of ยง 1.897-1(e);

(ii) Any asset so treated as held proportionately by the first corporation which is used or held for use by the second corporation in a trade or business shall be treated as so used or held for use by the first corporation; and

(iii) Interests in the second corporation held by the first corporation are not themselves taken into account as U.S. real property interests (regardless of whether the second corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation) or as trade or business assets. However, the first corporation shall not be treated as holding a proportionate share of assets that in the hands of the second corporation are subject to the rules of ยง 1.897-1(f)(3)(ii) (concerning the trade or business assets of investment companies). A determination of what portion of the assets of the second corporation are considered to be held by the first corporation shall be made as of the applicable dates for determining whether the first corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation.
