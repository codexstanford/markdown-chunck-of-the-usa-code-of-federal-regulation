####### Depreciation not capitalized to inventory.

(B)Because none of the depreciation with respect to the office building is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to the office building. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building for Year 1 is 75 percent, which is DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building that is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI under ยง 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($750x), divided by the total amount of DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building for Year 1 ($1000x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $7,500x ($10,000x x 0.75) of DC's average adjusted bases in the office building is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.
