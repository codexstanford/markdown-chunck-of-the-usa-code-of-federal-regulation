####### Special rule for stock that previously produced income that was excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C).

(iii)Stock with respect to which no dividends are received during a taxable year, but with respect to which dividends were received during one or both of the prior two taxable years, is characterized based on the relative portion of the dividends received that was passive or non-passive. If the dividends were in whole excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as a single non-passive asset. If the dividends were in part excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as two assets, one of which is a passive asset and one of which is a non-passive asset. The value (or adjusted basis) of the stock is allocated between the two assets in proportion to the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two taxable years that were characterized as passive income and the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two years that were characterized as non-passive income, for the previous two taxable years pursuant to section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. If the tested foreign corporation did not receive any dividends from the stock for the current taxable year or within either of the prior two taxable years of the tested foreign corporation, then the stock is treated as a passive asset.
