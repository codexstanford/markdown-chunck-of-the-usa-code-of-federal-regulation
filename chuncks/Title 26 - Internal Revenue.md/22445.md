####### In general.

(a)A separate line of business (as determined under ยง 1.414(r)-3) that does not satisfy any of the safe harbors in ยง 1.414(r)-5 for a testing year nonetheless satisfies the administrative scrutiny requirement of ยง 1.414(r)-1(b)(2)(iv)(D) if the employer requests and receives from the Commissioner an individual determination under this section that the separate line of business satisfies the requirement of administrative scrutiny for the testing year. This section implements the individual determinations provided for under section 414(r)(2)(C). The Commissioner shall issue such an individual determination only when it is consistent with the purpose of section 414(r), taking into account the nondiscrimination requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b). Paragraph (b) of this section authorizes the Commissioner to establish procedures for requesting and granting individual determinations.
