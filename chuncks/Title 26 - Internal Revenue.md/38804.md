###### § 1.905-3 Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
####### 2,Analysis,i,Result in Year 3.

()-()USC's failure to pay the tax by the end of Year 3 results in a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Because the taxes were not paid on or before the date 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which the tax relates, USC must account for the redetermination as if the unpaid 100u of accrued taxes were refunded on the last day of Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the deemed refund is translated at the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. Accordingly, USC must notify the IRS, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(8).
