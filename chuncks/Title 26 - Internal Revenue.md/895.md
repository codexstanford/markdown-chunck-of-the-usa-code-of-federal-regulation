####### Selection of low-income units for inspection and low-income certifications for review,1,Random selection.

(C)-()The Agency must select in a random manner the low-income units to be inspected and the units whose low-income certifications are to be reviewed. Agencies generally may not select the same low-income units of a low-income housing project for on-site inspections and low-income certification review, because doing so would usually give prohibited advance notice. See paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(2) of this section. An Agency may choose a different number of units for on-site inspections and for low-income certification review, provided the Agency chooses at least the minimum number of low-income units in each case. The Agency must select the units for inspections or low-income certification review separately and in a random manner.
