(B)As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of L's debt instrument. However, the portion of these modifications that increases the interest rate by the inducement spread changes the amount of cash flows on L's debt instrument, and that change is intended to induce L to perform the acts necessary to consent to a modification to the debt instrument described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread). Therefore, the portion of the modification that increases the interest rate by the inducement spread is described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of L's debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
