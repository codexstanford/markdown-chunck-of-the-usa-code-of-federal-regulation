######## Changes in a partner's tax liability,In general.

(a)-(1)A change in the tax liability of a partner to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code is made through a computational adjustment. A computational adjustment includes a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item, or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, if a change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made under the deficiency procedures (as described in subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code), except for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.
