####### Property in general-(a) Ordinary and temporary location.

(iii)Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (iv) through (x) of this subparagraph, the determination of whether property is ordinarily located in the United States will depend on all the facts and circumstances in each case. Property is ordinarily located in the United States if its location in the United States is regular, usual, or often occurring. However, in all cases property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is actually located in the United States for an aggregate of more than 50 percent of the days in the applicable policy period whereas property will, under no circumstances, be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is actually located in the United States for an aggregate of not more than 30 percent of the days in the applicable policy period. Property which is ordinarily located in the United States is temporarily located outside the United States when it is actually located outside the United States. For purposes of determining the number and percent of the days in an applicable policy period, the term "day" means, not any 24-consecutive-hour period, but a continuous period of twenty-four hours commencing from midnight and ending with the following midnight; in determining the location of property for such purposes, an amount of time which is at least one-half of such a day, but less than the entire day, shall be considered a day, and an amount of time which is less than one-half of such a day shall not be considered a day.
