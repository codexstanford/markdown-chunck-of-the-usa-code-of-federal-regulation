######## Letter to organization.

(a)When the Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) concludes that a section 501(c)(3) organization has engaged in flagrant political intervention and is likely to continue to engage in political intervention that involves political expenditures, the Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) shall send a letter to the organization providing it with the facts based on which the Service believes that the organization has been engaging in flagrant political intervention and is likely to continue to engage in political intervention that involves political expenditures. The organization will have 10 calendar days after the letter is sent to respond by establishing that it will immediately cease engaging in political intervention, or by providing the Service with sufficient information to refute the Service's evidence that it has been engaged in flagrant political intervention. The Internal Revenue Service will not proceed to seek an injunction under section 7409 until after the close of this 10-day response period.
