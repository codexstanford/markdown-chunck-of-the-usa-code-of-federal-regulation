In addition, in connection with a revaluation described in ยง 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(), the basis of an oil or gas property is allocated among the partners based on the principles used under ยง 1.704-1(b)(4)(i) of allocating tax items to take into account variations between the adjusted basis of the property and its fair market value. In the case of an oil or gas property contributed to a partnership by a partner, section 704(c) is taken into account in determining the partner's share of the adjusted basis.
