####### Termination of sponsored direct reporting NFFE.

(iii)If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that the status of a sponsored direct reporting NFFE is terminated (but not the sponsoring entity's status), the sponsoring entity must remove the sponsored direct reporting NFFE from the sponsoring entity's registration account on the FATCA registration website and send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which the sponsored direct reporting NFFE receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in ยง 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) was provided with respect to such sponsored direct reporting NFFE. A sponsored direct reporting NFFE that has had its status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE terminated (independent from a termination of status of its sponsoring entity) may not register on the FATCA registration website as a direct reporting NFFE or as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE of another sponsoring entity unless it receives written approval from the IRS.
