###### ยง 1.994-1 Inter-company pricing rules for DISC's.
####### Related party and related supplier.

(3)For the purposes of this section-

(i) The term "related party" means a person which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the DISC within the meaning of section 482 and ยง 1.482-1(a).

(ii) The term "related supplier" means a related party which singly engages in a transaction directly with the DISC which is subject to the rules of section 994 and this section. However, a DISC may have different related suppliers with respect to different transactions. If, for example, X owns all the stock of Y, a corporation, and of Z, a DISC, and sells a product to Y which is resold to Z, only Y is the related supplier of Z, and, thus, only the resale from Y to Z is subject to section 994 and this section. If, however, X sells directly to Z and Y also sells directly to Z, then, as to the transactions involving direct sales to Z, each of X and Y is a related supplier of Z.
