###### b

() An election made under the last sentence of section 46(e)(1) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which paragraph (1) of section 46(e) applies and which is short supply property within the meaning of ยง 1.46-5(b)(2) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) as set forth in a notice of proposed rule making published in 37 FR 3526 on February 17, 1971.

(iii) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and makes no election under paragraph (3) of such section, the election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e) shall apply to all of its section 46(e) property.

(iv) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), such election shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Paragraph (1) or (2) of section 46(e) (as the case may be) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property which is not property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and also makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), paragraph (3) shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies and paragraph (2) shall apply to the remainder of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property.
