####### Fixed but deferred contingent payments.

(ii)This paragraph (b)(9)(ii) provides rules that apply when the amount of a contingent payment becomes fixed before the payment is due. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if a contingent payment becomes fixed within the 6-month period ending on the due date of the payment, the payment is treated as a contingent payment even after the payment is fixed. If a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due, the following rules apply to the debt instrument.
