####### ยง 301.6222-1 Partner's return must be consistent with partnership return.
######## Example 1.

(i)K is a partner in Partnership during 2018. K treats a deduction and a capital gain attributable to Partnership on K's 2018 income tax return in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of those items by Partnership on its 2018 partnership return. K reports the inconsistent treatment of the deduction in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but not the inconsistent treatment of the gain. Because K did not notify the IRS of the inconsistent treatment of the gain in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the gain reported on K's 2018 income tax return in order to make the treatment of that gain consistent with how the gain was treated on Partnership's partnership return. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the IRS may assess and collect the underpayment of tax resulting from the adjustment to the gain as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on K's return.
