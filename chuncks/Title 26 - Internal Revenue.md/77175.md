###### Taxation of Nonresident Aliens Who Are Residents of Denmark and of Danish Corporations
####### ยง 521.108 Exemption from, or reduction in rate of, United States tax in the case of dividends, interest and royalties.
######## Dividends,General.

(a)-(1)The tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code in the case of dividends received from sources within the United States by (i) a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary and partnership) who is a resident of Denmark, or (ii) a Danish corporation is, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 1948, limited to 15 percent under the provisions of Article VI (relating to dividends) if such alien or corporation, at no time during the taxable year in which such dividends were so derived, had a permanent establishment within the United States. Thus, if a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark, performs personal services within the United States during the calendar year 1948 but has at no time during such year a permanent establishment within the United States, he is entitled to the reduced rate of tax with respect to such dividends derived in that year from United States sources, as provided in Article VI of the convention, even though by reason of his having rendered personal services within the United States he is engaged in trade or business therein in that year within the meaning of section 211(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If, for example, A, a nonresident alien who is a resident of Denmark, derives in 1948, $5,000 compensation for such personal services and his only other income from sources within the United States consists of dividends, the dividends are subject to tax at a rate not to exceed 15 percent and his earned income is subject to normal tax and surtax without taking the dividends into account in determining the tax on such earned income.
