##### Farmers' Cooperatives
###### ยง 1.522-1 Tax treatment of farmers' cooperative marketing and purchasing associations exempt under section 521.
####### In general.

(a)(1) Section 522 is applicable to farmers', fruit growers', or like associations organized and operated on a cooperative basis in the manner prescribed in section 521. Although such an association is subject to both normal tax and surtax, as in the case of corporations generally, certain special rules for the computation of taxable income are provided in section 522(b) and ยง 1.522-2. For the purpose of any law which refers to organizations exempt from income taxes such an association shall, however, be considered as an organization exempt under section 501. Thus, the provisions of section 243, providing a credit for dividends received from a domestic corporation subject to taxation, are not applicable to dividends received from a cooperative association subject to section 522. The provisions of section 1501, relating to consolidated returns, are likewise not applicable.

(2) Rules governing the manner in which amounts allocated as patronage dividends, refunds, or rebates are to be taken into account in computing the taxable income of such an association are set forth in ยง 1.522-3. For the tax treatment, as to patrons, of amounts received during the taxable year as patronage dividends, rebates, or refunds, see section 61 and ยง 1.61-5.
