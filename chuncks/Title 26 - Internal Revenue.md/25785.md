####### based on a reasonable price index

(10) An adjustment isif the adjustment reflects inflation or deflation occurring over a period during the lease term and is determined consistently under a generally recognized index for measuring inflation or deflation (for example, the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor). An adjustment will not fail to be treated as one that is based on a reasonable price index merely because the adjustment may be limited to a fixed percentage, but only if the parties reasonably expect, as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as the lease date, as of such date), that the fixed percentage will actually limit the amount of the rent payable during less than 50 percent of the lease term.
