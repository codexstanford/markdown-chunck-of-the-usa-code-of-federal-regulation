####### ii,Dual use ratio.

()Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is 25%, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's tested income for Year 1 ($5x), divided by the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x).
