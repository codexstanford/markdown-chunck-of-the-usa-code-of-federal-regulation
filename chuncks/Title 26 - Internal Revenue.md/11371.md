####### Capital additions.

(2)The adjusted basis of any certified coal mine safety equipment, with respect to which an election is made under section 187(b), shall not be increased, for purposes of section 187, for amounts chargeable to the capital account for additions or improvements after the amortization period has begun. However, nothing contained in this section or ยง 1.187-1 shall be deemed to disallow a deduction for depreciation for such capital additions. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer places a piece of certified coal mine safety equipment in service in 1971 and in 1972 makes improvements to it the expenditures for which are chargeable to the capital account, such improvements shall not increase the adjusted basis of the equipment for purposes of computing the amortization deduction allowed by section 187(a). However, the depreciation deduction provided by section 167 shall be allowed with respect to such improvements in accordance with the principles of section 167.
