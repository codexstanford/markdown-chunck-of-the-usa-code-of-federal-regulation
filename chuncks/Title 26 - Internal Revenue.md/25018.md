(a)A bond or other evidence of indebtedness (hereinafter in this section referred to as an obligation) issued by any person and payable on demand shall not be treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to a sale or other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property. In addition, an obligation issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof-

(2) In registered form (other than an obligation issued in registered form which the taxpayer establishes will not be readily tradable in an established securities market), or

(3) In any other form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market shall not be treated as an evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser in applying section 453(b) to a sale or other disposition of real property or to a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property. For purposes of this section, an obligation is to be considered in registered form if it is registered as to principal, interest, or both and if its transfer must be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the corporation of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the corporation of a new instrument to the new holder.
