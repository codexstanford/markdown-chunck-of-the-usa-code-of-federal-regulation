####### Analysis.

(ii)US1 is a specified party and thus a deduction for its $100x specified payment is subject to disallowance under section 267A. As described in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, the entire $100x payment is a disqualified hybrid amount under the reverse hybrid rule of ยง 1.267A-2(d) and, as a result, a deduction for the payment is disallowed under ยง 1.267A-1(b)(1).
