####### Determination of the amount of partnership interest expense that is subject to allocation and apportionment.

(ii)Interest on the nonrecourse loan on the domestic building is, under ยง 1.861-10T, directly allocable to income from that investment. The interest expense is therefore directly allocable to domestic income. Interest on the nonrecourse loan on the foreign building is not directly allocable. The interest expense is therefore subject to allocation and apportionment. Thus, $60 of interest expense is directly allocable to domestic income and $60 of interest expense is subject to allocation and apportionment.
