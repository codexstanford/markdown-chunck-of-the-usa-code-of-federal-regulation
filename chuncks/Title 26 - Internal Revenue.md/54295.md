####### Result.

(ii)As a result of the carryover of the year 1 $100x loss (which includes $50x of the year 1 dual consolidated loss) under Country Y law, a portion of such loss will be available to offset income of DEthat is attributable to P's interest in DEowned indirectly through PRS. A portion of such loss will also be available to offset income of DEthat is attributable to FS's indirect ownership of DE. Accordingly, under ยง 1.1503(d)-3(a), there would be a foreign use of a portion of P's $250x year 1 dual consolidated loss because it is available to offset an item of income of the owner of an interest in a hybrid entity, which is not a separate unit (there would also be a foreign use in this case because FSis a foreign corporation). However, there has not been a reduction of P's interest in DE, DEhas not consolidated under the laws of Country Y, and there has not been any other foreign use of the dual consolidated losses. As a result, no foreign use occurs as a result of the carryforward pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-3(c)(4)(i) and (ii).
