####### Exception to general rule.

(b)(1) The registered management investment company, which for the taxable year meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, may (subject to the limitations of section 851(e)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section) in the computation of 50 percent of the value of its assets under section 851(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.851-2 for any quarter of such taxable year, include the value of any securities of an issuer (whether or not the investment company owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer) if at the time of the latest acquisition of any securities of such issuer the basis of all such securities in the hands of the investment company does not exceed 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the investment company at that time. The exception provided by section 851(e)(1) and this subparagraph is not applicable to the securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer or of any predecessor company (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of the taxable year. The rule of section 851(e)(1) with respect to the relationship of the basis of the securities of an issuer to the value of the total assets of the investment company is, in substance, a qualification of the 5-percent limitation in section 851(b)(4)(A)(ii) and paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of § 1.851-2. All other provisions and requirements of section 851 and §§ 1.851-1 through 1.851-6 are applicable in determining whether such registered management investment company qualifies as a regulated investment company.
