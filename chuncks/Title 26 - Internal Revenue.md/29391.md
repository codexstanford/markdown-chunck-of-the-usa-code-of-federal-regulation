(a)In order for an organization to be considered a condominium management association or a residential real estate management association (and therefore in order for it to be considered a homeowners association), substantially all of its units, lots or buildings must be used by individuals for residences. For the purposes of applying paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and organization which has attributes of both a condominium management association and a residential real estate management association shall be considered that association which, based on all the facts and circumstances, it more closely resembles. In addition, those paragraphs shall be applied based on conditions existing on the last day of the organization's taxable year.
