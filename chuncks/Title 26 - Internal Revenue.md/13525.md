()-()All of the service that DC provides to FC is directly used in the provision of a service to R. However, because 90 percent of R's operations that will benefit from FC's service are located outside the United States under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, only 10 percent of the benefits of FC's service are conferred on persons located within the United States. Further, because FC's service confers a benefit on R's operations located within and outside the United States, the benefit provided by DC to FC is allocated proportionately based on the locations of R that benefit from the services provided by FC under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Therefore, only 10 percent of DC's architectural service are directly used by FC to confer benefits on persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the architectural service provided by DC to FC is not substantially similar to the design service provided by FC to persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
