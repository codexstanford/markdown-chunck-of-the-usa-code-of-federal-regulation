####### Reductions in investment credit,General rule.

(9)-(i)Certain reductions in a corporation's investment credit result from either a recapture under section 47 of the corporation's investment credit or a redetermination of the allowable credit. If these reductions are taken into account under a TRASOP, the plan may only use one or more of the methods described in paragraphs (e)(9), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section for taking into account these reductions. Thus, for example, more than one method is permitted upon a recapture with respect to a qualified investment made in a particular year. However, the method described in paragraphs (e)(9)(vii) of this section applies only to a recapture and not to a redetermination.
