####### Per se rules for certain distributions.,specified distribution

(B)Notwithstanding the presumption described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, except in the case of a specified distribution, a cash reduction transaction that is a distribution by a specified foreign corporation to a United States shareholder of the specified foreign corporation is treated per se as not being undertaken with a principal purpose of changing the amount of a section 965 element of the United States shareholder for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A specified distribution is treated per se as being undertaken with a principal purpose of changing the amount of a section 965 element of a United States shareholder for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), the termmeans a cash reduction transaction that is a distribution by a specified foreign corporation of a United States shareholder if and to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, there was a plan or intention for the distributee to transfer cash, accounts receivable, or cash-equivalent assets to any specified foreign corporation of the United States shareholder or a distribution that is a non pro rata distribution to a foreign person that is related to the United States shareholder. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there is no plan or intention for the distributee to transfer cash, accounts receivable, or cash-equivalent assets to any specified foreign corporation of the United States shareholder if the transfer is pursuant to a legal obligation entered into before November 2, 2017. A taxpayer that takes the position that a cash reduction transaction is not a specified distribution because a transfer of cash, accounts receivable, or cash-equivalent asset is pursuant to a legal obligation entered into before November 2, 2017, must attach a statement to its return for its taxable year in which or with which the relevant taxable year of the relevant specified foreign corporation ends disclosing the position.
