####### Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1970.

(b)(1) In the case of a husband and wife filing a separate return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1970, the optional tax imposed by section 3 shall be-

(i) For taxable years beginning in 1964, the lesser of the tax shown in Table IV (relating to the 10-percent standard deduction for married persons filing separate returns) or Table V (relating to the minimum standard deduction for married persons filing separate returns) of section 3(a), and

(ii) For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1964, and before January 1, 1970, the lesser of the tax shown in Table IV (relating to the 10-percent standard deduction for married persons filing separate returns) or Table V (relating to minimum standard deduction for married persons filing separate returns) of section 3(b).

(2) If the tax of one spouse is determined with regard to the 10-percent standard deduction provided for in Table IV of section 3(a) or 3(b) or if such spouse in computing taxable income uses the 10-percent standard deduction provided for in section 141(b), then the minimum standard deduction provided for in Table V of section 3(a) or 3(b) shall not apply in the case of the other spouse, if such spouse elects to pay the optional tax imposed under section (3). Thus, if a husband and wife compute their tax with reference to the standard deduction, one cannot elect to use the 10-percent standard deduction and the other elect to use the minimum standard deduction. However, an individual described in section 141(d)(2) may elect pursuant to such section and the regulations thereunder to pay the tax shown in Table V of section 3(a) or 3(b) in lieu of the tax shown in Table IV of section 3(a) or 3(b). See section 141(d) and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the standard deduction in the case of married individuals filing separate returns.
