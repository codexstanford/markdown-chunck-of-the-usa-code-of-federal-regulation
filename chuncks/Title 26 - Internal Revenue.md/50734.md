###### ยง 1.1471-2 Requirement to deduct and withhold tax on withholdable payments to certain FFIs.
####### Requirement to withhold if a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI makes an election to be withheld upon.

(iii)A person that otherwise would be a payee with respect to a payment but that makes an election to be withheld upon does not agree to accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment under chapter 3 or 4. Accordingly, such person cannot be treated as the payee and the withholding agent must determine whether it must withhold based on the chapter 4 status of the payee on whose behalf the person is receiving the payment. The election to be withheld upon is only available to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section. The election is not available to an entity that is required to accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment, such as a WP or WT receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, or an entity that already must be withheld upon because it may not accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment and, as such, already must pass up documentation with respect to the payee to the withholding agent, such as a participating FFI that is an NQI receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income.
