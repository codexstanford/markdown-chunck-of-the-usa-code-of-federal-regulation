(2)In order for a U.S. citizen and his nonresident alien spouse to make an election under section 981(a) and this section for any taxable year and in order for the election to apply for any subsequent taxable year it is required under section 981(a)(1) that, for each such taxable year, such citizen be (i) a citizen of the United States, (ii) a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries during the entire taxable year, and (iii) married at the close of the taxable year to an individual who is () a nonresident alien during the entire taxable year and (), in the case of any such subsequent taxable year, the same nonresident alien individual to whom the citizen was married at the close of the earliest of such taxable years. If either spouse dies during a taxable year, the taxable year of the surviving spouse shall be treated, solely for purposes of making the determination under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, as ending on the date of such death. A citizen of the United States shall be considered as not married at the close of his taxable year if he is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. However, the mere fact that spouses have not lived together during the course of the taxable year shall not cause them to be considered as not married at the close of the taxable year. A husband and wife who are separated under an interlocutory decree of divorce retain the relationship of husband and wife until the decree becomes final.
