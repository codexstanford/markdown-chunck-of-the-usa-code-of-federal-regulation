###### ยง 1.956-1 Shareholder's pro rata share of the average of the amounts of United States property held by a controlled foreign corporation.
####### Excluded charges.

(3)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a specific charge created with respect to any item of property principally for the purpose of artificially increasing or decreasing the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's investment of earnings in United States property will not be recognized; whether a specific charge is created principally for such purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the factors that will be considered in making such a determination with respect to a loan is whether the loan is from a related person, as defined in section 954 (d)(3) and paragraph (e) of ยง 1.954-1.
