()P directly owns 100% of the stock of S1. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, P cannot be the expanded group parent because P is a REIT. Because no other corporation owns stock in P meeting the requirements described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, P is not an expanded group member. S1 directly owns 99% of the stock of S2, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section). Although S2 is a corporation that is a REIT, a REIT may be a member of an expanded group described under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section provided the corporation is not the expanded group parent. In this case, S1 is the expanded group parent. S2 directly owns 100% of the stock of S3, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section). Therefore, S1, S2, and S3 constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
