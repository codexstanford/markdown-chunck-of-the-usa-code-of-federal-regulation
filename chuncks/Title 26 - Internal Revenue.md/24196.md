(C)-()If a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation owns any portion of a deferral entity on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section and such deferral entity was not in existence during the entire testing period (hereinafter referred to as a "newly formed deferral entity"), both the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test and the 2 percent gross income test are modified as follows. First, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation shall calculate the percentage of its adjusted taxable income or gross income that is attributable to deferral entities, excluding newly formed deferral entities. Second, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation shall calculate (on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section) the percentage of the tax basis of its assets that are attributable to its tax basis with respect to its ownership interests in all newly formed deferral entities. If the sum of the two percentages is 5 percent or less, the deferral entities are considered de minimis and are disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If the sum of the two percentages is greater than 5 percent, the deferral entities do not qualify for the de minimis rule provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and thus the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is considered to be a member of a tiered structure for purposes of this section.
