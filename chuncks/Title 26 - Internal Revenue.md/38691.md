(ii)-(A)Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), because USC's total net operating loss in Year 1 of ($1,400x) exceeds its total taxable income for Year 2 of $800x ($100x + $800x - $100x), USC has a partial net operating loss carryover to Year 2 of $800x. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, $100x of the U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for Year 2. The tentative foreign branch category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed the remaining net operating loss carryover amount. Therefore, $400x of the foreign branch category component of the net operating loss is allocated to reduce foreign branch category income in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, of the remaining $300x of net operating loss carryover ($800x - $100x - $400x), $200x is carried forward from the passive category component of the net operating loss and combined with the passive category loss for Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the remaining $100x ($300x - $200x) of net operating loss carryover is carried forward from the U.S. source component of the net operating loss and combined with the U.S. source income (and the previously allocated U.S. source component of the net operating loss) for Year 2.
