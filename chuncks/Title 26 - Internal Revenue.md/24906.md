####### Example 1: Gift cards not eligible for deferral method.

(i)E, a hair styling salon, receives advance payments for gift cards that may later be redeemed at the salon for hair styling services or hair care products at the face value of the gift card. The gift cards may not be redeemed for cash and have no expiration date. E does not track the sale date of the gift cards and includes advance payments for gift cards in AFS revenue when redeemed. Because E is unable to determine the extent to which advance payments are taken into account as AFS revenue for the taxable year of receipt, E cannot use the deferral method for these advance payments.
