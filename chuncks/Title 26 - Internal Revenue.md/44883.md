(iii) An amount which is considered under section 402(a)(2) or 403(a)(2) as gain of the taxpayer from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months shall be treated as gain subject to the provisions of section 1201 (d)(1) and subdivision (i) of such subparagraph, but only if on or before October 9, 1969, () the employee with respect to whom such amount is distributed or paid, died or was otherwise separated from the service, and () the terms of the plan required, or the employee elected, that total distributions or amounts payable be paid to the taxpayer within 1 taxable year.

(iv) Gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2) with respect to a partnership, estate, or trust, which is required to be included in the gross income of a partner in such partnership, or of a beneficiary of such estate or trust, shall be treated as such gain with respect to such partner or beneficiary. Thus, for example, if during 1974 a partnership which uses the calendar year as its taxable year receives amounts which give rise to section 1201(d)(1) gain, a partner who uses the fiscal year ending June 30 as his taxable year shall treat his distributive share of such gain as subsection (d) gain for his taxable year ending June 30, 1975, even though such share is distributed to him after December 31, 1974. See ยง 1.706-1.

(v) An individual shall be considered married for purposes of subdivision (iii) of such subparagraph if for the taxable year he may elect with his spouse to make a joint return under section 6013(a).

(vi) In applying such subparagraph for purposes of section 21(a) (1) long-term capital gains arising from amounts received before January 1, 1970, shall be taken into account if such amounts are received during the taxable year.
