####### Actual exercise of options not deemed exercised.

(ii)In determining whether the ownership change pursuant to the plan of reorganization qualifies under section 382(l)(5), a loss corporation may take into account stock acquired pursuant to the actual exercise of an option issued pursuant to the plan of reorganization if that option was not deemed exercised under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) applies only if the option is actually exercised within the 3 years of the ownership change by the 5-percent shareholder who, as a result of being a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor, acquired the option under the plan.
