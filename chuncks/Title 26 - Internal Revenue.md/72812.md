######## Example 1.

(i)H, an individual, is a partner in Partnership. On its partnership return for taxable year 2018, Partnership reports $100,000 in ordinary income. On the Schedule K-1 attached to the partnership return, as well as on the Schedule K-1 furnished to H, Partnership reports $15,000 as H's distributive share of the $100,000 in ordinary income. H reports only $5,000 of the $15,000 of ordinary income on his 2018 income tax return. The IRS may determine the amount of tax that results from adjusting the ordinary income attributable to H's interest in Partnership reported on H's 2018 income tax return from $5,000 to $15,000 and assess that resulting underpayment in tax as if it were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on H's return. H may not request an abatement of that assessment under section 6213(b).
