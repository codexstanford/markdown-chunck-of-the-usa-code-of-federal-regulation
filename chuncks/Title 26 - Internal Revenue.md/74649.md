####### ยง 301.6511(d)-2 Overpayment of income tax on account of net operating loss or capital loss carrybacks.
######## Barred overpayments.

(b)(1)If the allowance of a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax attributable to a net operating loss carryback or capital loss carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 7122, relating to compromises), such credit or refund may be allowed or made under the provisions of section 6511(d)(2)(B) if a claim therefor is filed within the period provided by section 6511(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section for filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback. Similarly, if the allowance of an application, credit, or refund of a decrease in the tax determined under section 6411(b) is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 7122), such application, credit, or refund may be allowed or made if an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed within the period provided in section 6411(a). Thus, for example, even though the tax liability (not including the net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback (or the effect of such deduction or carryback)) for a given taxable year has previously been litigated before the Tax Court, credit or refund of an overpayment may be allowed or made despite the provisions of section 6512(a), if claim for such credit or refund is filed within the period provided in section 6511(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback, or in the case of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment, the determination of any court, including the Tax Court, in any proceeding in which the decision of the court has become final, shall be conclusive except with respect to the net operating loss deduction, and the effect of such deduction, or with respect to the determination of a short-term capital loss, and the effect of such short-term capital loss, to the extent that such deduction or short-term capital loss is affected by a carryback which was not in issue in such proceeding.

(2) For purposes of the special period of limitation for filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax with respect to a computation year (as defined in section 1302(c)(1)) by an individual who has chosen to compute his tax under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging), such claim is determined to relate to an overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback when such carryback relates to any base period year (as defined in section 1302(c)(3)). Thus, if (i) an individual has a net operating loss for a taxable year subsequent to a taxable year for which he had chosen the benefits of income averaging, and (ii) such net operating loss carryback is wholly utilized in any one or more of his base period years (which would result in an increased amount of averageable income for such computation year), the special period of limitation with respect to such individual's computation year applies and a timely claim for credit or refund with respect to the computation year may be filed.
