####### In general.,homeowners association

(a)Section 528 only applies to taxable years of homeowners associations beginning after December 31, 1973. To qualify as a homeowners association an organization must either be a condominium management association or a residential real estate management association. For the purposes of Section 528 and the regulations under that section, the termshall refer only to an organization described in section 528. Cooperative housing corporations and organizations based on a similar form of ownership are not eligible to be taxed as homeowners associations. As a general rule, membership in either a condominium management association or a residential real estate management association is confined to the developers and the owners of the units, residences, or lots. Furthermore, membership in either type of association is normally required as a condition of such ownership. However, if the membership of an organization consists of other homeowners associations, the owners of units, residences, or lots who are members of such other homeowners associations will be treated as the members of the organization for the purposes of the regulations under section 528.
