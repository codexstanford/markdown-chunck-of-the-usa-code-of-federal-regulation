####### Partner basis adjustment upon disposition of partnership interest.,Example 9,Example 10

(3)If a partner (transferor) disposes of an interest in a partnership, the adjusted basis of the partnership interest being disposed of (transferred interest) is increased immediately before the disposition by the amount of the excess (if any) of the amount of the basis reduction under paragraph (h)(2) of this section over the portion of any excess business interest expense allocated to the transferor under paragraph (f)(2) of this section which has previously been treated under paragraph (g) of this section as business interest expense paid or accrued by the transferor, multiplied by the ratio of the fair market value of the transferred interest to the total fair market value of the transferor's partnership interest immediately prior to the disposition. Therefore, the adjusted basis of the transferred interest is not increased immediately before the disposition by any allocation of excess business interest expense from the partnership that did not reduce the transferor's adjusted basis in its partnership interest pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section prior to the disposition, or by any excess business interest expense that was treated under paragraph (g) of this section as business interest expense paid or accrued by the transferor prior to the disposition. If the transferor disposes of all of its partnership interest, no deduction under section 163(j) is allowed to the transferor or transferee under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code for any excess business interest expense or negative section 163(j) expense. If the transferor disposes of a portion of its partnership interest, no deduction under section 163(j) is allowed to the transferor or transferee under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code for the amount of excess business interest expense proportionate to the transferred interest. The amount of excess business interest expense proportionate to the partnership interest retained by the transferor shall remain as excess business interest expense of the transferor until such time as such excess business interest expense is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued by the transferor pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. Further, if the transferor disposes of a portion of its partnership interest, any negative section 163(j) expense shall remain negative section 163(j) expense of the transferor partner until such negative section 163(j) expense is no longer suspended under section 704(d). For purposes of this paragraph, a disposition includes a distribution of money or other property by the partnership to a partner in complete liquidation of its interest in the partnership. Further, solely for purposes of this section, each partner is considered to have disposed of its partnership interest if the partnership terminates under section 708(b)(1). Seeandin paragraphs (o)(9) and (o)(10) of this section, respectively.
