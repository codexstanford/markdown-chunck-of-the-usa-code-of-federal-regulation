(ii)-(A)() USP's deduction of $14,000x for state income taxes is definitely related and allocable to the gross income with respect to which the taxes are imposed. However, in these facts, an adjustment is necessary before the aggregate state taxable incomes can be compared with U.S. source income on the Federal income tax return in the manner described in paragraphs (g)(25)(ii) and (g)(26)(ii) of this section (the analysis inand). Unlike the facts in paragraphs (g)(25)(i) and (g)(26)(i) of this section (the facts inand), state A imposes no income tax and does not define taxable income attributable to activities in state A. The total amount of USP's income subject to state taxation is, therefore, $400,000x ($200,000x in state B and $200,000x in state C). This total presumptively does not include any income attributable to activities performed in state A and therefore cannot properly be compared to total U.S. source taxable income reported by USP for Federal income tax purposes, which does include income attributable to state A activities.
