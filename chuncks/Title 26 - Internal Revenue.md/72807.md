####### ยง 301.6222-1 Partner's return must be consistent with partnership return.
######## Example 7.

(vii)G was a partner in Partnership during 2018. G's taxable year ends on the same day as Partnership's 2018 taxable year. Partnership did not file a partnership return for its 2018 taxable year. G files an income tax return for its 2018 taxable year and reports G's share of a loss attributable to G's interest in Partnership. Because Partnership failed to file a partnership return, G's treatment of such loss is per se inconsistent pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
