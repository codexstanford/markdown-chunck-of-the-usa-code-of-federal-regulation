(C)The facts are the same as inof paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(A) of this section, except that the written agreement betweenandis to purchase 100 model XPC5 lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Because this agreement specifies the amount and design of the lamps to be purchased, the agreement is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section. However, because the agreement was entered into before September 28, 2017, no lamp acquired byunder this contract qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.
