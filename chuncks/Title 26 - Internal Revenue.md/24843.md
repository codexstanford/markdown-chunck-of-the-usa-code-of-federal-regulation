####### Determination of an "estimated redemption percentage."

(4)For purposes of applying subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph, one permissible method of estimating the number of trading stamps or coupons issued for a taxable year that will ultimately be presented for redemption is to multiply such number of stamps issued for such year by an "estimated redemption percentage." For purposes of this section the term "estimated redemption percentage" for a taxable year means a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of trading stamps or coupons issued during a taxable year that it is reasonably estimated will ultimately be redeemed, and the denominator of which is the number of trading stamps or coupons issued during such year. Consequently, the product of such percentage and the number of stamps issued for such year equals the number of trading stamps or coupons issued for such year that it is estimated will ultimately be redeemed.
