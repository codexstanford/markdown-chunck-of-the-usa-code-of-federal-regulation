####### Result.

(B)Under paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section, the rules of § 1.367(a)-8T (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2007) apply to the transfers pursuant to the asset reorganization because the initial transfer occurred on March 7, 2007. As a result of the disposition of the TFC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization, under § 1.367(a)-8T(d), USP is required to recognize the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement and pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to such gain. Because the acquiring corporation in the asset reorganization is foreign, an exception under § 1.367(a)-8T(e) is not available for the exchange of TFC stock by USP. However, pursuant to paragraph (r)(2)(i) of this section, because the exception provided by paragraph (k)(14) of this section is not included in § 1.367(a)-8T, USP may apply paragraph (k)(14) of this section to such exchange (provided the conditions of paragraph (k)(14) of this section are satisfied), if the statute of limitations on assessments of tax for the 2007 tax year has not closed. If USP applies paragraph (k)(14) of this section to its exchange of the TFC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization, under paragraph (r)(2)(ii) of this section USP must include the new gain recognition agreement required under paragraph (k)(14)(iii) of this section with an amended Federal income tax return for its 2008 tax year that is filed August 10, 2009.
