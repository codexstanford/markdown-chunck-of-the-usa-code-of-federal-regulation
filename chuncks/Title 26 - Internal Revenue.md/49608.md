####### Terms of the withholding agreement.,e.g.,,i.e.,

(B)The withholding agreement shall specify the obligations of the qualified intermediary under chapters 3 and 4 including, for a qualified intermediary that is an FFI, the documentation, withholding, and reporting obligations required of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI as defined in ยง 1.1471-1(b)(114)) with respect to each branch of the qualified intermediary other than a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. The withholding agreement will specify the type of certifications and documentation upon which the qualified intermediary may rely to ascertain the classification (corporation or partnership), status (U.S. or foreign and chapter 4 status) of beneficial owners and payees who receive reportable amounts, reportable payments, and withholdable payments collected by the qualified intermediary for purposes of chapters 3, 4, and 61, section 3406, and, if necessary, entitlement to the benefits of a reduced rate under an income tax treaty. The withholding agreement shall specify if, and to what extent, the qualified intermediary may assume primary withholding responsibility in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. It shall also specify the extent to which applicable return filing and information reporting requirements are modified so that, in appropriate cases, the qualified intermediary may report payments to the IRS on an aggregated basis, without having to disclose the identity of beneficial owners and payees. However, the qualified intermediary may be required to provide to the IRS the name and address of those foreign customers who benefit from a reduced rate under an income tax treaty pursuant to the withholding agreement for purposes of verifying entitlement to such benefits, particularly under an applicable limitation on benefits provision. Under the withholding agreement, a qualified intermediary may agree to act as an acceptance agent to perform the duties described in ยง 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv)(A) of this chapter. The withholding agreement may specify the manner in which applicable procedures for adjustments for underwithholding and overwithholding, including refund procedures, apply to qualified intermediaries and the extent to which applicable procedures may be modified. In particular, a withholding agreement may allow a qualified intermediary to claim refunds of overwithheld amounts. In addition, the withholding agreement shall specify the manner in which the IRS will verify compliance with the agreement, including the time and manner for which a qualified intermediary will be required to certify to the IRS regarding its compliance with the withholding agreement (including its performance of a periodic review) and the types of information required to be disclosed as part of the certification. In appropriate cases, the IRS may require review procedures be performed by an approved reviewer (in addition to those performed as part of the periodic review) and may conduct a review of the reviewer's findings. The withholding agreement may include provisions for the assessment and collection of tax in the event that failure to comply with the terms of the withholding agreement results in the failure by the withholding agent or the qualified intermediary to withhold and deposit the required amount of tax. Further, the withholding agreement may specify the procedures by which amounts withheld are to be deposited, if different from the deposit procedures under the Code and applicable regulations. To determine whether to enter a withholding agreement and the terms of any particular withholding agreement, the IRS will consider the type of local know-your-customer laws and practices to which the entity is subject (if the entity is an FFI), as well as the extent and nature of supervisory and regulatory control exercised under the laws of the foreign country over the foreign entity.
