####### Analysis.

(ii)The analysis in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section remains the same regarding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) through (3) of this section, except that the relevant dates are: December 22, 2017, and November 1, 2019 (the date X made a revocation of its S corporation status). Although the effective date of X's revocation of its S election (January 1, 2020) occurs after the conclusion of the two-year period specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section are satisfied.
