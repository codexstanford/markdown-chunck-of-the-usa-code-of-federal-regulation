(c)-(1)The notice not to have a section 615(e) election treated as a section 617(a) election shall be made in a statement filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed. If the election is made within the time period prescribed for filing an income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year during which the taxpayer pays or incurs, after December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by the taxpayer under section 617(a) if he made a valid election to deduct exploration expenditures under such section, the statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for such year. If the statement is filed after the time prescribed for filing such return but before the expiration of the period (described in paragraph (e) of this section) for filing the notice, the statement must be signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed even though the taxpayer charges to capital account all such expenditures paid or incurred by him after December 31, 1969. If the taxpayer desires, he may file this statement by attaching it to his return for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which he pays or incurs after December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by him under section 617(a) if at such time he had in effect a valid election under such section.
