####### Erroneous filing of return for regular tax year.

(D)If, under this paragraph (a)(6)(ii), target files a return for so much of old target's regular taxable year as ends at the close of the acquisition date but the selling group files a consolidated return, target must file an amended return for old target not later than the due date (including extensions) for the selling group's consolidated return. (The amended return is a deemed sale return.)
