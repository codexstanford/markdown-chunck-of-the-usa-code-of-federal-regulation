####### AFS cost offset method.

(2)A taxpayer that uses the AFS cost offset method and, if applicable, the advance payment cost offset method, to account for gross income from the sale of an item of inventory determines the AFS income inclusion amount, or, if applicable, the advance payment income inclusion amount, for a taxable year prior to the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer by following the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, subject to the additional rules and limitations in paragraphs (c)(4) through (6) of this section. Such taxpayer determines the AFS income inclusion amount or, if applicable, the advance payment income inclusion amount, for the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer by following the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. A taxpayer described in this paragraph (c)(2) that receives advance payments for the sale of the item of inventory may be required to include in gross income for a taxable year an amount that is comprised of both an AFS income inclusion amount and an advance payment income inclusion amount. In such case, it is not necessary to determine the portion of the total inclusion that is comprised of the AFS income inclusion amount and the portion of the total inclusion that is comprised of the advance payment income inclusion amount.
