(B)In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer may choose to allocate the unused foreign taxes with respect to general category income in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income based on a ratio equal to the amount of foreign income taxes assigned to the general category that were paid or accrued by the taxpayer's foreign branches (as defined in ยง 1.904-4(f)(3)(vii)) bears to all foreign income taxes assigned to the general category that were paid or accrued, or deemed paid by the taxpayer with respect to such taxable year.
