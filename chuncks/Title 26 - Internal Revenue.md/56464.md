###### ยง 1.6045-2 Furnishing statement required with respect to certain substitute payments.
####### Coordination with section 6042.

(h)In cases in which reporting is required by both sections 6042 and 6045(d) with respect to the same substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, the provisions of section 6045(d) control, and no report or statement under section 6042 need be made. If reporting is not required under section 6045(d) with respect to a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, a report under section 6042 must be made if required in accordance with the rules of section 6042 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, if a broker receives a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend on behalf of an individual customer and the broker does not have reason to know by the record date of the payment that the payment is in lieu of a dividend of a type described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, the broker must report with respect to the substitute payment if required in accordance with section 6042 and the regulations thereunder.
