####### Answer 1:

No. Section 267(a)(2) applies only if an otherwise deductible amount is owed to a related person under whose method of accounting such amount is not includible in income unless paid to such person. Regardless of when payment is made, an amount owed to a contractor using the completed contract method of accounting is includible in the income of the contractor in accordance with ยง 1.451-3(d) in the year in which the contract is completed or in which certain disputes are resolved.
