####### Method of accounting.,i.e.,

(g)A taxpayer that adopts or elects a cost allocation method of accounting (or changes to another cost allocation method of accounting with the Commissioner's consent) must apply that method consistently for all similarly classified contracts, until the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under section 446(e) to change to another cost allocation method. A taxpayer-initiated change in cost allocation method will be permitted only on a cut-off basis (for contracts entered into on or after the year of change) and thus, a section 481(a) adjustment will not be permitted or required.
