###### ยง 301.6339-1 Legal effect of certificate of sale of personal property and deed of real property.
####### Effect of junior encumbrances.

(c)A certificate of sale of personal property given or a deed to real property executed pursuant to section 6338 discharges the property from all liens, encumbrances, and titles over which the lien of the United States, with respect to which the levy was made, has priority. For example, a mortgage on real property executed after a notice of a Federal tax lien has been filed is extinguished when the district director executes a deed to the real property to a purchaser thereof at a sale pursuant to section 6335 following the seizure of the property by the United States. The proceeds of such a sale are distributed in accordance with priority of the liens, encumbrances, or titles. See section 6342(b) and the regulations thereunder for provisions relating to the distribution of surplus proceeds. See section 7426(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder for judicial procedures with respect to surplus proceeds.
