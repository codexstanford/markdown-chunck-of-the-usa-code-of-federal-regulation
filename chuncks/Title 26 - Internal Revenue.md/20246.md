####### Fresh-start rules for defined benefit plans,Introduction.

(c)-(1)This paragraph (c) provides rules that must be satisfied in order to use the fresh-start testing options for defined benefit plans in ยง 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(6)(vii) and (d)(3)(iii), relating to the safe harbors and the general test, respectively. Those fresh-start options are designed to allow a plan to be tested without regard to benefits accrued before a selected fresh-start date. To the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, those options also may be used to disregard certain increases in benefits attributable to compensation increases after a fresh-start date. Although this paragraph (c) generally requires a plan to be amended to freeze employees' accrued benefits as of a fresh-start date and to provide any additional accrued benefits after the fresh-start date solely in accordance with certain specified formulas, certain of these requirements do not apply to a plan that is tested under the general test of ยง 1.401(a)(4)-3(c). See ยง 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(6)(vii) and (d)(3)(iii).
