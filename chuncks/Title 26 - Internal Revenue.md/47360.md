###### ยง 1.1335-1 Elective method; time and manner of making election and effect thereof.
####### In general.

(a)If the taxpayer elects to have the provisions of section 1333 applicable to any taxable year in which any money or property is recovered in respect of war loss property, section 1333 will be applicable by virtue of that election to all taxable years of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1941. Thus, the taxpayer need not make an election with respect to each separate taxable year in which he had a recovery. An election for any taxable year in which the taxpayer had a recovery in respect of a prior war loss is sufficient to make the provisions of section 1333 applicable not only to war loss recoveries received by the taxpayer in any past taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941, but to any recoveries which may be received by the taxpayer in any future taxable year. Such election once made shall be irrevocable. The election to have the provisions of section 1333 applicable to any taxable year cannot be made unless the taxpayer recovers money or property (in respect of a prior war loss) during the taxable year for which such election is made.
