(3)-(i)The Agency must be required to file Form 8823, "Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of Noncompliance," with the Service no later than 45 days after the end of the correction period (as described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, including extensions permitted under that paragraph) and no earlier than the end of the correction period, whether or not the noncompliance or failure to certify is corrected. The Agency must explain on Form 8823 the nature of the noncompliance or failure to certify and indicate whether the owner has corrected the noncompliance or failure to certify. Any change in either the applicable fraction or eligible basis under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) and (vii) of this section, respectively, that results in a decrease in the qualified basis of the project under section 42 (c)(1)(A) is noncompliance that must be reported to the Service under this paragraph (e)(3). If an Agency reports on Form 8823 that a building is entirely out of compliance and will not be in compliance at any time in the future, the Agency need not file Form 8823 in subsequent years to report that building's noncompliance. If the noncompliance or failure to certify is corrected within 3 years after the end of the correction period, the Agency is required to file Form 8823 with the Service reporting the correction of the noncompliance or failure to certify.
