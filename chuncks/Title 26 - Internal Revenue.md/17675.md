(B)The transfer by TFC of the TFD stock to DC and the exchange by A of the TFC stock for DC stock pursuant to the asset reorganization are triggering events under paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(4) of this section, respectively. The gain recognition agreement does not terminate under paragraph (o)(5) of this section because DC is neither the U.S. transferor, nor an individual that is a United States person, nor a member of the same consolidated group of which the U.S. transferor is a member. However, if paragraph (k)(14) of this section applies the exchanges shall not constitute triggering events.
