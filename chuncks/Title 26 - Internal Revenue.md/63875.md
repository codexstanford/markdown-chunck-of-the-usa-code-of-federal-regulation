###### General Provisions
####### § 31.3121(a)(1)-1 Annual wage limitation.
######## Wages paid by predecessor attributed to successor.

(b)(1) If an employer (hereinafter referred to as a successor) during any calendar year acquires substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another employer (hereinafter referred to as a predecessor), or used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and if immediately after the acquisition the successor employs in his trade or business an individual who immediately prior to the acquisition was employed in the trade or business of such predecessor, then, for purposes of the application of the annual wage limitation set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, any remuneration (exclusive of remuneration excepted from wages in accordance with paragraph (j) of § 31.3121(a)-1 or §§ 31.3121(a)(2)-1 to 31.3121(a)(15)-1, inclusive) with respect to employment paid (or considered under this paragraph as having been paid) to such individual by the predecessor during such calendar year and prior to the acquisition shall be considered as having been paid by the successor.

(2) The wages paid, or considered as having been paid, by a predecessor to an employee shall, for purposes of the annual wage limitation, be treated as having been paid to such employee by a successor if:

(i) The successor during a calendar year acquired substantially all the property used in a trade or business, or used in a separate unit of a trade or business, of the predecessor;

(ii) Such employee was employed in the trade or business of the predecessor immediately prior to the acquisition and is employed by the successor in his trade or business immediately after the acquisition; and

(iii) Such wages were paid during the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred and prior to such acquisition.

(3) The method of acquisition by an employer of the property of another employer is immaterial. The acquisition may occur as a consequence of the incorporation of a business by a sole proprietor or a partnership, the continuance without interruption of the business of a previously existing partnership by a new partnership or by a sole proprietor, or a purchase or any other transaction whereby substantially all the property used in a trade or business, or used in a separate unit of a trade or business, of one employer is acquired by another employer.

(4) Substantially all the property used in a separate unit of a trade or business may consist of substantially all the property used in the performance of an essential operation of the trade or business, or it may consist of substantially all the property used in a relatively self-sustaining entity which forms a part of the trade or business.

(5) A successor may receive credit for wages paid to an employee by a predecessor only if immediately prior to the acquisition the employee was employed by the predecessor in his trade or business which was acquired by the successor and if immediately after the acquisition such employee is employed by the successor in his trade or business (whether or not in the same trade or business in which the acquired property is used). If the acquisition involves only a separate unit of a trade or business of the predecessor, the employee need not have been employed by the predecessor in that unit provided he was employed in the trade or business of which the acquired unit was a part.

(6) Where a corporation described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) has in effect a certificate filed pursuant to section 3121(k), or pursuant to section 1426(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, waiving its exemption from the taxes imposed by the Act, the activity in which such corporation is engaged is considered to be its trade or business for the purpose of determining whether the transferred property was used in the trade or business of the predecessor and for the purpose of determining whether the employment by the predecessor and the successor of an individual whose services were retained by the successor constitute employment in a trade or business. Thus, if a charitable or religious organization, subject to the taxes by virtue of its certificate, acquires all the property of another such organization likewise subject to the taxes and retains the services of employees of the predecessor, wages paid to such employees by the predecessor in the year of the acquisition (and prior to such acquisition) will be attributed to the successor for purposes of the annual wage limitation.
