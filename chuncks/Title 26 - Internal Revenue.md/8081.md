####### Analysis.

(B)The $100x of interest expense is business interest expense for purposes of section 163(j) (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section). X's ATI in the 2021 taxable year is $100x ($0 of tentative taxable income computed without regard to $100x of business interest expense). Thus, X may deduct $30x of its $100x of business interest expense in the 2021 taxable year under ยง 1.163(j)-2(b) (30 percent x $100x), and X may carry forward the remainder ($70x) to X's 2022 taxable year as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward under ยง 1.163(j)-2(c). Although X may not currently deduct all $100x of its business interest expense in the 2021 taxable year, X must reduce its earnings and profits in that taxable year by the full amount of its business interest expense ($100x) in that taxable year. As a result, no portion of X's distribution of $100x to its shareholders in the 2021 taxable year is a dividend within the meaning of section 316(a).
