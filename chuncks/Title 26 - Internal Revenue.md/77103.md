####### General,Taxable as though no convention.

(a)-(1)Notwithstanding any other provision of the convention the United States, in determining the United States tax of a citizen or resident of the United States, or of a domestic corporation, may, under Article XV(1)(a) of the convention, include in the basis upon which such tax is imposed all items of income taxable under the revenue laws of the United States, as though the convention had not come into effect. For example, despite the exemption from United States tax granted by Article VIII of the convention with respect to a copyright royalty derived from sources within the United States by a resident of Switzerland, such royalty shall be included in gross income and is subject to United States tax when so derived by a resident of Switzerland who is a citizen of the United States, even though such resident has no permanent establishment in the United States.
