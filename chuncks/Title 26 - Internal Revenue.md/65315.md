(3)If an employee is furnished a Form W-2 in a timely manner, the statement required by this paragraph (h) may be furnished with the employee's Form W-2. Any statement not so furnished shall be furnished by direct, personal delivery to the employee or by first class mail addressed to the employee at his or her current or last known address.
