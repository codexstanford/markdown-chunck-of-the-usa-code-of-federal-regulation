####### Seller-retention of target stock.

(iv)If seller retains any target stock after the disposition date, seller is treated as having disposed of the old target stock so retained, on the disposition date, in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized, and then, on the day after the disposition date, purchasing the stock so retained from an unrelated person for its fair market value. The holding period for the retained stock starts on the day after the disposition date. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv), the fair market value of all of the target stock equals the grossed-up amount realized on the sale, exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of target (see ยง 1.336-3(c)).
