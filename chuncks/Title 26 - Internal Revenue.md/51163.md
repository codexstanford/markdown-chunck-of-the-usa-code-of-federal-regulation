####### Specific identification and documentation procedures for preexisting individual accounts,In general.,1,2

(iv)-(A)A participating FFI applying the identification and documentation procedures of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv) must review its preexisting individual accounts (applying the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section and, if appropriate, the enhanced review for high-value accounts described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D) of this section) to determine if there are any U.S. indicia (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)() of this section) associated with the account. If no U.S. indicia are identified with respect to an account, the participating FFI may treat the account as a non-U.S. account. If U.S. indicia are identified with respect to an account, the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)() of this section to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person. A participating FFI that follows the procedures described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iv) (as applicable) with respect to its preexisting individual accounts will not be treated as having reason to know that the determination made with respect to the account was unreliable or incorrect because of information contained in any account files that the participating FFI did not review and was not required to review under the applicable identification procedure. Thus, for example, if a participating FFI was only required to perform an electronic search with respect to a preexisting individual account and no U.S. indicia were identified in the results of the electronic search, the participating FFI would not have reason to know that the individual account holder was a U.S. person, even if the participating FFI had on file (but was not required to and did not review) a copy of the individual's passport that indicates that the individual was born in the United States.
