Thus, the first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) of any WIN employee shall be the same with respect to any shareholder claiming a credit under section 40 for salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by such employee. Also, such first 12 months of employment and the period described in section 50B(c)(4), with respect to any WIN employee, shall not be deemed to begin again because of the making of a valid election under section 1372.
