####### Failure to receive a complete transfer statement.

(v)A broker that has not received a complete transfer statement as required under ยง 1.6045A-1(a)(3) for a transfer of a specified security must request a complete statement from the applicable person effecting the transfer unless, under ยง 1.6045A-1(a), the transferor has no duty to furnish a transfer statement for the transfer. The broker is only required to make this request once. If the broker does not receive a complete transfer statement after requesting it, the broker may treat the security as a noncovered security upon its subsequent sale or transfer. A transfer statement for a covered security is complete if, in the view of the receiving broker, it provides sufficient information to comply with this section when reporting the sale of the security. A transfer statement for a noncovered security is complete if it indicates that the security is a noncovered security.
