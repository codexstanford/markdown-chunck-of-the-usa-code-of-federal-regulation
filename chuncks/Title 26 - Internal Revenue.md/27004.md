####### Appendices and supplements to the income statement.

(iii)Information reported in an appendix or supplement to a taxpayer's financial income statement is considered a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss for the period covered by the income statement if the appendix or supplement accompanies the income statement in a single report and the information reported in the appendix or supplement is clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement. If an appendix or supplement to an income statement is issued in a report that does not include the income statement, the question of whether the information reported therein is supplemental or explanatory is determined under the rules in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, an appendix or supplement to an income statement includes written statements, schedules, and reports that are labelled supplements or appendices to the income statement. However, sections of an annual report such as those labelled "President's Letter", "Management's Analysis", "Statement of Changes in Financial Position", "Summary of Key Figures", and similar sections are reports described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section and are not considered "supplements or appendices to an income statement" within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, regardless of whether such sections are also labelled as supplements or appendices. For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, information is considered to be clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement if the information either-

(A) Is reported in an appendix or supplement that contains a general statement identifying all such supplemental or explanatory information;

(B) Is identified specifically as supplemental or explanatory by a statement immediately preceding or following the disclosure of the information;

(C) Is disclosed in the context of making a comparison to corresponding information disclosed both on the face of the taxpayer's income statement and in the supplement or appendix; or

(D) Is a disclosure of the effect on an item reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement of having used the LIFO method.
