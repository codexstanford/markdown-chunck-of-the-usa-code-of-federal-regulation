######## Partnership pays an imputed underpayment.

(3)If a partnership pays an imputed underpayment (as determined under § 301.6225-1(b)) and the total netted partnership adjustment (as calculated under § 301.6225-1(b)(2)) includes a partnership adjustment to an amount subject to withholding, the partnership is treated as having paid (at the time that the imputed underpayment is paid) the amount required to be withheld with respect to that partnership adjustment under chapter 3 or chapter 4 for purposes of applying §§ 1.1463-1 and 1.1474-4 of this chapter. See § 301.6225-1(b)(3) for the coordination rule that applies for calculating an imputed underpayment when an adjustment is made to an amount subject to withholding for which tax has been collected under chapter 3 or chapter 4.
