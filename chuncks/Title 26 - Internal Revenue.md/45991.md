####### Disposition of farm recapture property.

(2)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, no gain or loss (regardless of how treated) resulting from the disposition of farm recapture property shall be taken into account, except that under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph gain upon disposition of such property which is recognized as ordinary income by reason of section 1245(a)(1) shall be taken into account. Thus, for example, if land used in the trade or business of farming were disposed of and gain of $3,000 was realized, then none of such gain would be taken into account in computing farm net loss and farm net income even if all or a portion of such gain is recognized as ordinary income by reason of section 1251(c)(1), section 1252(a)(1), or both. If such land were disposed of at a loss, the result would be the same. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to the exclusion of gain or loss from the disposition of farm recapture property from the computation of nonfarm adjusted gross income.
