Thus, the term includes any amounts includable in gross income as compensation for personal services pursuant to a plan, or method having the effect of a plan, deferring the taxation of such payment to a taxable year later than that in which such services were rendered. For purposes of section 1348, the termis not limited to payments to common-law employees but also includes payments to self-employed individuals: nor is it material that no deduction is allowable in respect of all or part of such payments or that a deduction in respect thereof is allowable under some provision of the Code other than section 404.

The termas defined in this paragraph, shall have no application to a determination of the deductibility of any amount under section 162, 404, or any other provision of the Code.
