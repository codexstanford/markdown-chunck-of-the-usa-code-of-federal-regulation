####### Allocation of loss attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift.

(4)For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, a thrift's allocable share of a loss attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is determined by multiplying the loss by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the tentative taxable income (if greater than zero) of the thrift (taking into account paragraph (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section) and the denominator is the aggregate of such tentative taxable income (so determined) of each thrift.
