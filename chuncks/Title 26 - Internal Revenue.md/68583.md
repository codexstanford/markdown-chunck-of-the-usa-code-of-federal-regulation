(3)For purposes of section 509(a)(3)(A), a charitable trust shall be treated as if organized on the day on which it first becomes subject to section 4947(a)(1). However, for purposes of applying §§ 1.509(a)-4(d) (2)(iv)(), and 1.509(a)-4(i)(1) (ii) and (iii)() the previous relationship between the charitable trust and the section 509(a) (1) or (2) organizations it benefits or supports may be considered.

For the special rules pertaining to the application of the organizational test to organizations terminating their private foundation status under the 12-month or 60-month termination period provided under section 507(b)(1)(B) by becoming "public" under section 509(a)(3), see the regulations under section 507(b)(1).
