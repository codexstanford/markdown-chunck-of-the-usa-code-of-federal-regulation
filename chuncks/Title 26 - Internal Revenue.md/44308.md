###### § 1.1038-3 Election to have section 1038 apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
####### In general.

(a)If an election is made in the manner provided by paragraph (b) of this section, the applicable provisions of §§ 1.1038-1 and 1.1038-2 shall apply to all reacquisitions of real property occurring in each and every taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election so made shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law and shall apply to every reacquisition occurring in such taxable years. The fact that the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is prevented for any other taxable year or years affected by the election will not prohibit the making of an election under this section. For example, if an individual who uses the calendar year as the taxable year were to sell in 1960 real property used as his principal residence in respect of the sale of which gain is not recognized under section 1034, and if such property were reacquired by the seller in 1962 and resold within 1 year, he would be permitted to make an election under this section with respect to such reacquisition even though on September 2, 1964, the period of limitations on assessment or refund has run for 1960. An election under this section shall be deemed a consent to the application of the provisions of this section.
