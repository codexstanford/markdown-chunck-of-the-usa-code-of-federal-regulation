(E)Under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, previously taxed earnings and profits resulting from subpart F inclusions and GILTI inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1's current taxable year are separated from CFC1's other earnings and profits and added to an annual PTEP account and PTEP group within the PTEP account, under the rules of ยง 1.960-3(c). The United States shareholders of CFC1 include in gross income subpart F inclusions totaling $1,250,000x with respect to 1,250,000u of subpart F income of CFC1, and the subpart F inclusions are passive category income. Therefore, under ยง 1.960-3(c)(2), 1,250,000u of previously taxed earnings and profits resulting from the subpart F inclusions is added to CFC1's section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP within the 2019 annual PTEP account within the passive category.
