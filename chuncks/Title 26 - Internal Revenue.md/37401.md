####### Analysis.

(ii)The additional $50x Country X tax paid by U.S.C. in Year 6 that relates to Year 1 cannot be claimed by U.S.C. as a deduction on an amended return for Year 1 because the additional tax accrued in Year 6. See section 461(f) (flush language); §§ 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) and 1.461-2(a)(2). In addition, because the additional $50x Country X tax relates to and is considered to accrue in Year 1 for foreign tax credit purposes, U.S.C. cannot claim a credit for the additional $50x Country X tax on its Federal income tax return for Year 6. See § 1.905-1(d)(1). However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, U.S.C. can claim a deduction for the additional $50x Country X tax that relates to Year 1 on its Federal income tax return for Year 6, even though it claims a credit for foreign income taxes that accrue in Year 6 and that relate to Year 6.
