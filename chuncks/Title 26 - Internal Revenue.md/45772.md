####### Treatment of property in hands of transferee.

(3)If property is disposed of in a transaction which is a gift:

(i) The additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to (a) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus (b) the amount of any gain (in case the disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift) which would have been taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition if the applicable percentage had been 100 percent.

(ii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period under section 1250(e)(2) of property received as a gift in the hands of the transferee includes the transferor's holding period,

(iii) In case of a disposition which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, if the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of ยง 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements), and

(iv) If the property disposed of consists of two or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of ยง 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(1) of ยง 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.
