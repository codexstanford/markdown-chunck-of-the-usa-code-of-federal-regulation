(2) Perform, on a centralized basis, only one or more specifically enumerated services which, if performed directly by a tax exempt hospital, would constitute activities in the exercise or performance of the purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption, and

(3) Perform such service or services solely for two or more patron-hospitals as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
