####### No interaction with the intercompany obligation rules of § 1.1502-13(g).

(3)The rules of this section do not affect the application of the rules of § 1.1502-13(g). Thus, any deemed satisfaction and reissuance of a debt instrument under § 1.1502-13(g) and any deemed issuance and deemed exchange of a debt instrument under this paragraph (c) that arise as part of the same transaction or series of transactions are not integrated. Rather, each deemed satisfaction and reissuance under the rules of § 1.1502-13(g), and each deemed issuance and exchange under the rules of this section, are respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions.
