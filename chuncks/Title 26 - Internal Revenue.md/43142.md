###### ยง 1.991-1 Taxation of a domestic international sales corporation.
####### In general.

(a)A corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject to any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code (sections 1 through 1564) for such taxable year, except for the tax imposed by chapter 5 thereof (sections 1491 through 1494) on certain transfers to avoid tax. Thus, for example, a corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject for such year to the corporate income tax (section 11), the minimum tax on tax preferences (sections 56 through 58), or the accumulated earnings tax (sections 531 through 537). A DISC is liable for the payment of all taxes payable by corporations under other subtitles of the Code, such as, for example, income taxes withheld at the source and other employment taxes under subtitle C and the interest equalization tax and other miscellaneous excise taxes imposed by subtitle D. In addition, a DISC is subject to the provisions of chapter 3 of subtitle A (including section 1461), relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds. See ยง 1.992-1 for the definition of the term "DISC."
