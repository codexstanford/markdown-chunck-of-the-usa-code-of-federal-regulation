####### Effective date.

(5)The look-back method, including the de minimis exception, applies to long-term contracts entered into after February 28, 1986. With respect to activities that are subject to section 460 solely because they benefit a long-term contract of a related party, the look-back method generally applies only if the related party's long-term contract was entered into after June 20, 1988, unless a principal purpose of the related-party arrangement is to avoid the requirements of section 460.
