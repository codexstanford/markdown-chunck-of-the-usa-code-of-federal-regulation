####### Definition of self-constructed property,In general.,See

(k)-(1)Property is self-constructed property if it is reasonable to believe that more than half of the construction expenditures for the property will be made directly by the taxpayer. Construction expenditures made directly by the taxpayer include direct costs such as wages and materials and indirect costs such as overhead attributable to construction of the property. Expenditures for direct and indirect costs of construction will be treated as construction expenditures made directly by the taxpayer only to the extent that the expenditures directly benefit the construction of the property by employees of the taxpayer. Thus, wages paid to taxpayers's employees and expenditures for basic construction materials, such as sheet metal, lumber, glass, and nails, which are used by employees of the taxpayer to construct progress expenditure property, will be considered made directly by the taxpayer. Construction expenditures made by the taxpayer to a contractor or manufacturer, in general, will not be considered made directly by the taxpayer. Thus, the cost of component parts, such as boilers and turbines, which are purchased and merely installed or assembled by the taxpayer, will not be considered expenditures made directly by the taxpayer for construction. (paragraph (h)(3) of this section to determine when such cost is properly chargeable to capital account.)
