####### Tax preference offset.,tax preference offset

(3)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, theis the amount by which the greater of:

(A) The average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years, or

(B) The taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year,

(ii) The items of tax preference to be taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for any taxable year shall be those items of tax preference referred to in section 57(a) and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year, but excluding any amount not taken into account in computing the tax under section 56(a) and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year. The items of tax preference to be taken into account by an individual for any taxable year in which such individual is or was a nonresident alien shall not include items of tax preference which are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

(iii) Taxable years ending before January 1, 1970 shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, the tax preference offset for a taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, is the amount by which the average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, or the taxpayer's items of tax preference for 1973, whichever is greater, exceeds $30,000. Taxable years during which the taxpayer was not in existence shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. A fractional part of a year which is treated as a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) shall be treated as a taxable year for purposes of this section for special rules if a taxable year referred to in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph is a period of less than 12 months for which a return is required under section 443(a)(1).

(iv) If for the current taxable year the taxpayer and his spouse (or the estate of such spouse) file a joint return together, the items of tax preference for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the items of tax preference of the taxpayer and his spouse for such preceding year even though a joint return was not, or could not have been, filed by the taxpayer and such spouse for such preceding taxable year. If for the current taxable year the taxpayer (A) is no longer married to a spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph and files a return as a single person, head of household, or surviving spouse for such current taxable year, or (B) is married to a spouse other than the spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph, his items of tax preference shall be computed as if he were not married during such preceding taxable year.

(v) The sum of the items of tax preference of an estate or trust shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be apportioned between the estate or trust and the beneficiary in the manner and to the extent provided by section 58(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder.

(vi) If an item of gross income in respect of a decedent is includible in the gross income of a taxpayer and is treated as earned income in the hands of the taxpayer by reason of ยง 1.1348-3(a)(4), the items of tax preference for a taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for such taxable year and the decedent's items of tax preference for any taxable year of the decedent (including a short taxable year described in section 441(b)(3)) which ends with or within such taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of this subdivision, if a taxpayer (such as the estate of the decedent or a testamentary trust created by the decedent) has not been in existence for the number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A) or (iii) of this subparagraph, the items of tax preference for preceding taxable years taken into account shall be the taxpayer's items of tax preference for each of its preceding taxable years plus the decedent's items of tax preference for that number of the most recent taxable years of the decedent ending prior to the taxpayer's earliest taxable year which, when added to the taxpayer's preceding taxable years, equals such number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A), or (iii). The increase, if any, in the taxpayer's tax preference offset computed under this subdivision shall not exceed the amount by which the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income, computed as provided in ยง 1.1348-2(d)(2) and including the item of gross income in respect of a decedent, exceeds the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income computed without regard to such item of gross income.
