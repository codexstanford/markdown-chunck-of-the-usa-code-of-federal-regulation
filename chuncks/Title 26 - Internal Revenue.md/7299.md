####### 2,Conclusion.

()Because Corporation T's $400,000 distributive share of the partnership's deduction is attributable to the compensation paid by the partnership for services performed by Employee D, a covered employee of Corporation T, the $400,000 is compensation within the meaning of this paragraph (c)(3) and Corporation T's deduction for this expense for its 2021 taxable year is subject to the section 162(m)(1) limit. Corporation T's $400,000 allocation of the partnership's deduction is aggregated with Corporation T's deduction for compensation paid to Employee D, if any, in determining the amount allowable as a deduction to Corporation T for compensation paid to Employee D for Corporation T's 2021 taxable year. The result is the same whether Employee D performs services for the partnership as a common law employee, an independent contractor, or a partner, and whether the payment to Employee D is a payment under section 707(a) or section 707(c).
