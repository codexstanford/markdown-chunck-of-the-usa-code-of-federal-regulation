####### Effect of end of separate tracking.

(2)If this paragraph (a) applies with respect to a member (or loss subgroup), then, starting on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the member's net operating loss carryover that arose (or is treated under ยง 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-21T(c) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as arising) in a SRLY, is treated as described in ยง 1.1502-91A(c)(1)(i). Also, the member's separately computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss is included in the determination whether the group has a net unrealized built-in gain or loss. The preceding sentences also apply for purposes of determining whether there is an ownership change with respect to such attributes following such change date (or earlier day) or 5 consecutive year period. Thus, for example, starting the day after the change date or the end of the 5 consecutive year period-

(i) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of the stock of the new loss member or loss subgroup parent to determine if an ownership change occurs with respect to the attributes of the new loss member or members included in the loss subgroup;

(ii) The group includes the member's attributes in determining whether it is a loss group under ยง 1.1502-91A(c);

(iii) There is an ownership change with respect to such attributes only if the group is a loss group and has an ownership change; and

(iv) If the group has an ownership change, such attributes are pre-change consolidated attributes subject to the loss group's consolidated section 382 limitation.
