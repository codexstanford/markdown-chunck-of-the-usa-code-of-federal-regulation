####### Consequences of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.

(C)Under the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule, New T is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as transferring Equipment #6 to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount and, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property (New Equipment #6) from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, New T is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #6 in service.
