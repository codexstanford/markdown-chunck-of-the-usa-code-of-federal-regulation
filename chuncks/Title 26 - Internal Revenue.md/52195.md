####### 3,Intercompany sale for loss.,1,Example 18

()The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(R)() of this section (the facts in), except that S recognizes $25 of loss on the sale of Asset. S's $25 of intercompany loss is taken into account under the matching rule to reflect the $25 difference between B's $25 corresponding item taken into account (based on B's $100 cost basis in Asset) and the recomputed corresponding item (based on the $125 basis that B would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation and B's basis were determined by reference to S's $125 of costs). Applying section 250 and ยง 1.1502-50 on a single entity basis, $0 of income would be included in gross DEI. In order to reflect this result, under the matching rule, S's $25 loss is allocated and apportioned solely to B's $25 of gross income from the sale of Asset for purposes of determining B's DEI and FDDEI. Furthermore, B's $25 of gross income is not taken into account for purposes of apportioning any other deductions under section 861 and the regulations under that section for purposes of determining any member's DEI or FDDEI.
