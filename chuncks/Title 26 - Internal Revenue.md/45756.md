####### Determination of additional depreciation in certain cases.,e

(6)If an item of section 1250 property is subject to two (or more) applicable percentages, a separate computation of additional depreciation shall be made for the portion of the taxpayer's holding period subject to each such percentage. That is, a separate computation shall be made to determine the excess of (i) the depreciation adjustments (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for each such portion of the taxpayer's holding period after December 31, 1963, over (ii) the amount such adjustments would have been for each such portion if such adjustments were determined under the straight line method of depreciation (or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision in paragraph (c) of this section). Thus, for example, in the case of an item of section 1250 property acquired on January 1, 1968, and disposed of on January 1, 1973, if the applicable percentage for the period before January 1, 1970, were determined under paragraph (d)(2) of ยง 1.1250-1 and the applicable percentage for the period after December 31, 1969, were determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)() of ยง 1.1250-1, the additional depreciation would be computed separately for the period before January 1, 1970, and for the period after December 31, 1969. If the additional depreciation attributable to any such portion of the taxpayer's holding period is a deficit (that is, if the depreciation adjustments for that portion are less than the amount such adjustments would have been for that portion if depreciation adjustments were determined for the entire period the property was held under the straight line method of depreciation, or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision in paragraph (c) of this section), then such deficit will be applied to reduce the additional depreciation for other portion (or portions) of the taxpayer's holding period. (See examples (4) and (5) of subparagraph (7) of this paragraph.)
