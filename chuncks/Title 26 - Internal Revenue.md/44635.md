####### Application of the Lookthrough Rule.

(ii)If the Lookthrough Rule applies, for purposes of applying an Owner Taxpayer's Recharacterization Amount, as described in paragraph (a) of this section-

(A) The Owner Taxpayer must include the entire amount of capital gain recognized on the disposition of an API by the Owner Taxpayer in the Owner Taxpayer's API One Year Disposition Amount; and

(B) The Owner Taxpayer must include in its Three Year Disposition Amount an amount equal its One Year Disposition Amount (determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section) reduced by the Owner Taxpayer's share of the amount of any gain, directly or indirectly, from assets held for three years or less that would have been allocated to the Owner Taxpayer (to the extent attributable to the transferred API) by the partnership if the partnership had sold all of its property in a fully taxable transaction for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such property (taking into account section 7701(g)) immediately prior to the Owner Taxpayer's transfer of the API.

(C) In the case of an API disposition by an API Holder that is a Passthrough Entity and not an Owner Taxpayer, the principles set forth in paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section must be applied to determine the amount to include in the Owner Taxpayer's One Year Distributive Amount and in paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amounts included in the Owner Taxpayer's Three Year Distributive Share Amount.
