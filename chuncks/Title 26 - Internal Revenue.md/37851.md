####### General rules for allocating and assigning a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity,In general.

(d)-(1)Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (d) provides rules for allocating a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest, as well as for assigning the allocated amount to a U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor. For purposes of this paragraph (d), unless otherwise indicated, a reference to direct or indirect ownership in an entity means for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for U.S. income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes, and at least one of the fiscally transparent entities is not a disregarded entity. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for foreign income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for foreign income tax purposes. If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a lower-tier fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which the section 901(m) payor indirectly owns an interest, the rules of this section apply in a manner consistent with the application of these rules when the section 901(m) payor directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).
