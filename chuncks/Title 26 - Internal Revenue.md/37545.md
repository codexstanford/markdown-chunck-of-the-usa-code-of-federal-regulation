####### Exception for increase in liability in connection with anti-hybrid rules,In general.

(iv)-(A)If a taxpayer (the "first taxpayer") that makes a payment to another taxpayer (the "second taxpayer") is permitted to increase the first taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax (for example, by waiving an otherwise allowable deduction), and doing so results in a greater decrease in the amount of liability for foreign income tax of the second taxpayer by reason of the deactivation of a hybrid mismatch rule that would otherwise apply to the second taxpayer, then the increase in the first taxpayer's liability is not considered to result in a foreign payment in excess of the first taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5).
