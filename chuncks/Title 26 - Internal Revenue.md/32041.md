()The partners' capital accounts will not be considered adjusted in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)() unless the amount of book depreciation, depletion, or amortization for a period with respect to an item of partnership property is the amount that bears the same relationship to the book value of such property as the depreciation (or cost recovery deduction), depletion, or amortization computed for tax purposes with respect to such property for such period bears to the adjusted tax basis of such property. If such property has a zero adjusted tax basis, the book depreciation, depletion, or amortization may be determined under any reasonable method selected by the partnership. For purposes of the preceding sentence, additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) is not a reasonable method.
