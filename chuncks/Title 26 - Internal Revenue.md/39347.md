####### Export controlled products,In general.

(h)-(1)Section 927(a)(2)(D) provides that an export controlled product is not export property. A product or commodity may be an export controlled product at one time but not an export controlled product at another time. For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity is an "export controlled product" at a particular time if at that time the export of such product or commodity is prohibited or curtailed under section 7(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, to effectuate the policy relating to the protection of the domestic economy set forth in paragraph (2)(C) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1979. That policy is to use export controls to the extent necessary to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand.
