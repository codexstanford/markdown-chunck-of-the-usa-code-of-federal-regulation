####### ยง 301.6222-1 Partner's return must be consistent with partnership return.
######## Example 1.

(i)A is a partner in Partnership during 2018 and 2019. In December 2018, Partnership receives an advance payment for services to be performed in 2019 and reports this amount as income on its partnership return for 2018. A includes its distributive share of income from the advance payment on A's income tax return for 2019 and not on A's income tax return for 2018. A has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section because A's treatment of the income attributable to Partnership is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by Partnership on its partnership return.
