(13)A corporation that is not an eligible corporation is ineligible. If a life company is ineligible, it is not treated under section 1504(c)(2) as an includible corporation. Losses of a nonlife member arising in years when it is ineligible may not be used under section 1503(c)(2) and paragraph (g) of this section to set off the income of a life member. If a life company is ineligible and is the common parent of the group (without regard to section 1504(b)(2)), the election under section 1504(c)(2) may not be made.
