####### Definition of "depletable product".

(2)For purposes of this paragraph, the term "depletable product" means any product or commodity of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 613 or 613A. Thus, the term depletable product includes any mineral extracted from a mine, an oil or gas well, or any other natural deposit, whether or not the DISC or related supplier is allowed a deduction, or is eligible to take a deduction, for depletion with respect to the mineral in computing its taxable income. Thus, for example, iron ore purchased by a DISC from a broker is a depletable product in the hands of the DISC for purposes of this paragraph even though the DISC is not eligible to take a deduction for depletion under section 613 or 613A.
