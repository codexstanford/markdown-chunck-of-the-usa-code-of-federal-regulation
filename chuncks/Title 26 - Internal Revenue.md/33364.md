###### ยง 1.812-4 Operations loss carrybacks and operations loss carryovers.
####### Amount of loss to be carried.

(5)The amount which is carried back or carried over to any taxable year is the loss from operations to the extent it was not absorbed in the computation of gain from operations for other taxable years, preceding such taxable year, to which it may be carried back or carried over. For the purpose of determining the gain from operations for any such preceding taxable year, the various operations loss carryovers and carrybacks to such taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the gain from operations in the order of the taxable years from which such losses are carried over or carried back, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year.
