()The determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is included in a CFC group is made as of the close of the CFC inclusion year of the controlled foreign corporation that ends with or within the taxable years of the controlling domestic shareholders. One or more controlled foreign corporations are members of a CFC group if the requirements of paragraph (c)(7)(viii)(E)() of this section are satisfied as of the end of the CFC inclusion year of at least one of the controlled foreign corporations, even if the requirements are not satisfied as of the end of the CFC inclusion year of all controlled foreign corporations. If the controlling domestic shareholders do not have the same taxable year, the determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is a member of a CFC group is made with respect to the CFC inclusion year that ends with or within the taxable year of the majority of the controlling domestic shareholders (determined based on voting power) or, if no such majority taxable year exists, the calendar year. See paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(E) (Example 5) of this section for an example that illustrates the application of the rule set forth in this paragraph (c)(7)(viii)(E)()(). Notwithstanding the rule set forth in this paragraph (c)(7)(viii)(E)()(), a controlled foreign corporation is not a member of a CFC group if, as of the close of its CFC inclusion year, the controlled foreign corporation does not have a controlling domestic shareholder.
