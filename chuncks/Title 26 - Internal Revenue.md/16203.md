(b)Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to-

(1) Any assets transferred to a tax-exempt entity to the extent that the assets are used in an activity the income from which is subject to tax under section 511(a) (referred to hereinafter as a "section 511(a) activity"). However, if assets used to any extent in a section 511(a) activity are disposed of by the tax-exempt entity, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (except section 1031 or section 1033), any gain (not in excess of the amount not recognized by reason of the preceding sentence) shall be included in the tax-exempt entity's unrelated business taxable income. To the extent that the tax-exempt entity ceases to use the assets in a section 511(a) activity, the entity will be treated for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1) as having disposed of the assets on the date of the cessation for their fair market value. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and this paragraph (b)(1)-

(i) If during the first taxable year following the transfer of an asset or the corporation's change to tax-exempt status the asset will be used by the tax-exempt entity partly or wholly in a section 511(a) activity, the taxable corporation will recognize an amount of gain or loss that bears the same ratio to the asset's built-in gain or loss as 100 percent reduced by the percentage of use for such taxable year in the section 511(a) activity bears to 100 percent. For purposes of determining the gain or loss, if any, to be recognized, the taxable corporation may rely on a written representation from the tax-exempt entity estimating the percentage of the asset's anticipated use in a section 511(a) activity for such taxable year, using a reasonable method of allocation, unless the taxable corporation has reason to believe that the tax-exempt entity's representation is not made in good faith;

(ii) If for any taxable year the percentage of an asset's use in a section 511(a) activity decreases from the estimate used in computing gain or loss recognized under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, adjusted for any decreases taken into account under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) in prior taxable years, the tax-exempt entity shall recognize an amount of gain or loss that bears the same ratio to the asset's built-in gain or loss as the percentage point decrease in use in the section 511(a) activity for the taxable year bears to 100 percent;

(iii) If property on which all or a portion of the gain or loss is not recognized by reason of the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is disposed of in a transaction that qualifies for nonrecognition treatment under section 1031 or section 1033, the tax-exempt entity must treat the replacement property as remaining subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the extent that the exchanged or involuntarily converted property was so subject;

(iv) The tax-exempt entity must use the same reasonable method of allocation for determining the percentage that it uses the assets in a section 511(a) activity as it uses for other tax purposes, such as determining the amount of depreciation deductions. The tax-exempt entity also must use this same reasonable method of allocation for each taxable year that it holds the assets; and

(v) An asset's built-in gain or loss is the amount that would be recognized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section except for this paragraph (b)(1);

(2) Any transfer of assets to the extent gain or loss otherwise is recognized by the taxable corporation on the transfer. See, for example, sections 336, 337(b)(2), 367, and 1001;

(3) Any transfer of assets to the extent the transaction qualifies for nonrecognition treatment under section 1031 or section 1033; or

(4) Any forfeiture of a taxable corporation's assets in a criminal or civil action to the United States, the government of a possession of the United States, a state, the District of Columbia, the government of a foreign country, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing; or any expropriation of a taxable corporation's assets by the government of a foreign country.
