(17)-(i)P owns DRC, a member of the P consolidated group. DRCowns FS. In year 1, DRCincurs a $100x net operating loss that is a dual consolidated loss. To prevent corporations like DRCfrom offsetting losses both against income of affiliates in Country X and against income of foreign affiliates under the tax laws of another country, Country X mirror legislation prevents a corporation that is subject to the income tax of another country on its worldwide income or on a residence basis from using the Country X form of consolidation. Accordingly, the Country X mirror legislation prevents the loss of DRCfrom being made available to offset income of FS.
