() After deduction of $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 5, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $35 ($35 x 80 percent = $28). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $35, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($35-$35).
