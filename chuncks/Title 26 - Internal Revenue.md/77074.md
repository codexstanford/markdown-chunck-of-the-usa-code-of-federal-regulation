####### Allocation of profits.

(2)In the determination of the income taxable to such enterprise for purposes of the United States tax, all industrial and commercial profits from sources within the United States shall be deemed to be allocable to the permanent establishment in the United States. Hence, if a Swiss enterprise which has a permanent establishment in the United States at some time during the taxable year were to sell in the United States, through a commission agent therein acting in the ordinary course of his business as such, merchandise which has been produced in Switzerland, the profits arising from such sale would be allocable to the permanent establishment to the extent they are derived from sources within the United States, even though the sale is made independently of the permanent establishment.
