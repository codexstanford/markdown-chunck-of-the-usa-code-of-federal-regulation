####### In general.

(a)If the separate adjusted gross income of a husband is less than $5,000 and the separate adjusted gross income of his wife is less than $5,000, and if each is required to file a return, the husband and the wife must each elect to pay the optional tax imposed under section 3 or neither may so elect. If the separate adjusted gross income of each spouse is $5,000 or more, then neither spouse can elect to pay the optional tax imposed under section 3. If the adjusted gross income of one spouse is $5,000 or more and that of the other spouse is less than $5,000, the election to pay the optional tax imposed under section 3 may be exercised by the spouse having adjusted gross income of less than $5,000 only if the spouse having adjusted gross income of $5,000 or more, in computing taxable income, uses the standard deduction provided by section 141. If the spouse having adjusted gross income of $5,000 or more does not use the standard deduction, then the spouse having adjusted gross income of less than $5,000 may not elect to pay the optional tax and must compute taxable income without regard to the standard deduction. Accordingly, if the spouse having adjusted gross income of $5,000 or more itemizes the deductions allowed by sections 161 and 211 in computing taxable income, the spouse having adjusted gross income of less than $5,000 must also compute taxable income by itemizing the deductions allowed by sections 161 and 211, and must pay the tax imposed by section 1. For rules relative to the election to take the standard deduction by husband and wife, see part IV (section 141 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.
