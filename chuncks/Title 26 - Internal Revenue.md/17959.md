###### § 1.367(d)-1 Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations.
####### Intangible property transferred from branch with previously deducted losses.

(3)(i) If income is required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) and the regulations thereunder or under § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of intangible property of a foreign branch that had previously deducted losses, then the income recognized under those sections with respect to that property is credited against amounts that would otherwise be required to be recognized with respect to that same property under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section in either the current or future taxable years. The amount recognized under section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6 with respect to the transferred intangible property is determined in accordance with the following formula:

(ii) For purposes of the formula in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, the "loss recapture income" is the total amount required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6. The "gain from intangible property" is the total amount of gain realized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) and § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of items of property that are subject to section 367(d). "Gain from intangible property" does not include gain realized with respect to intangible property by reason of an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The "gain from all branch assets" is the total amount of gain realized by the transferor upon the transfer of items of property of the branch for which gain is realized.

(g)(4) through (i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(4) through (i).
