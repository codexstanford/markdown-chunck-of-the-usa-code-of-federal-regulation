####### Example 3: No overlap-Section 382 event before SRLY event.,Example 2

(iii)(A) The facts are the same as inexcept that Individual B does not sell the additional 35% of T to S until September 30, Year 2.

(B) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover. The September 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.

(C) Because the SRLY event did not occur within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is no overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation and a section 382 limitation.
