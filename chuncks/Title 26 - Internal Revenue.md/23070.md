###### ยง 1.421-2 General rules.
####### Effect of qualifying transfer.

(a)(1) If a share of stock is transferred to an individual pursuant to the individual's exercise of a statutory option, and if the requirements of ยง 1.422-1(a) (relating to incentive stock options) or ยง 1.423-1(a) (relating to employee stock purchase plans) whichever is applicable, are met, then-

(i) No income results under section 83 at the time of the transfer of such share to the individual upon the exercise of the option with respect to such share;

(ii) No deduction under sections 83(h) or 162 or the regulations thereunder (relating to trade or business expenses) is allowable at any time with respect to the share so transferred; and

(iii) No amount other than the price paid under the option is considered as received by the employer corporation, a related corporation of such corporation, or a corporation substituting or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which ยง 1.424-1(a) (relating to corporate reorganizations, liquidations, etc.) applies, for the share so transferred.

(2) For the purpose of this paragraph, each share of stock transferred pursuant to a statutory option is treated separately. For example, if an individual, while employed by a corporation granting him a statutory option, exercises the option with respect to part of the stock covered by the option, and if such individual exercises the balance of the option more than three months after leaving such employment, the application of section 421 to the stock obtained upon the earlier exercise of the option is not affected by the fact that the income taxes of the employer and the individual with respect to the stock obtained upon the later exercise of the option are not determined under section 421.
