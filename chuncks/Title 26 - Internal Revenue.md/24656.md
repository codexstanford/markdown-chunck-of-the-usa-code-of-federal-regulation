(vi)-(A)In November 2021, G, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, enters into a contract to sell 1,000 units to W, a wholesaler, for $10 per unit, totaling $10,000 (1,000 x $10). The contract also provides that G will credit or pay W $4 per unit (a 40% "chargeback") for sales W makes to certain qualifying customers. G delivers 600 units to W on December 31, 2021, and bills W $6,000 under the contract. W does not make any sales to qualifying customers in 2021. For its AFS, G reports $3,600 ($6,000-$2,400) of AFS revenue for 2021, which includes a reduction of the $6,000 of sales revenue by $2,400 (40% x $6,000) for anticipated chargebacks.
