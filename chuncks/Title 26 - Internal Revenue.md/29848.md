###### ยง 1.585-2 Addition to reserve.
####### Deduction with respect to initial balance.

(3)The deduction with respect to the initial balance of the reserve at the close of the taxable year of change, determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, is allowable ratably over a period of 10 years commencing with the taxable year of change (or a shorter period as may be approved by the Commissioner). Thus, the bad debt deduction under section 166 for the taxable year of change will consist of the amount of debts determined to be wholly or partially worthless and charged-off during such taxable year plus one-tenth (if a 10-year period is used) of the amount of the reserve determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. For each of the 9 taxable years following the taxable year of change, the bad debt deduction will consist of the reasonable addition to the reserve for bad debts for each such year as provided by section 585, as otherwise determined, plus one-tenth of the amount determined to be theinitial balance of the reserve under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The amount established as a bad debt reserve for the taxable year of change under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be considered as the balance of the reserve for purposes of determining the amount of subsequent additions to such reserve, even though the entire amount of the reserve may not have been deducted under section 585(a)(1) or former section 166(c) because of the requirement that it be deducted over a number of years.
