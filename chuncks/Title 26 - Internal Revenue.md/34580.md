###### ยง 1.861-8 Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities.
####### Allocation and apportionment of section 172 deduction.

(ii)A net operating loss taken as a deduction in computing taxable income for a particular taxable year as allowed under section 172 is allocated and apportioned to statutory and residual groupings by reference to the statutory and residual groupings of the components of the net operating loss (as determined under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section) that is deducted in the taxable year. Except as provided under the rules for an operative section, if the full net operating loss carryover is not taken as a deduction in a taxable year, the partial net operating loss deduction is treated as ratably comprising the components of a net operating loss. See, for example, ยง 1.904(g)-3, which is an exception to the general rule described in the previous sentence and provides rules for determining the source and separate category of a partial net operating loss deduction for purposes of section 904 as the operative section.
