(ii)DRCceased being a dual resident corporation at the end of year 1. Therefore, its year 1 dual consolidated loss cannot be offset by tainted income. Asset A is a tainted asset because it was acquired in a nonrecognition transaction after DRCceased being a dual resident corporation (and was not replacement property acquired in the ordinary course of business). As a result, the $50x of income recognized by DRCon the disposition of asset A is tainted income and cannot be offset by the year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRC. In addition, absent evidence establishing the actual amount of tainted income, $25x of the $100x year 5 operating income of DRC(($100x/$400x) x $100x) also is treated as tainted income and cannot be offset by the year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRCunder ยง 1.1503(d)-4(e)(2)(ii). Therefore, $75x of the $150x year 5 income of DRCconstitutes tainted income and may not be offset by the year 1 dual consolidated loss of DRC; however, the remaining $75x of year 5 income of DRCmay be offset by such dual consolidated loss. The result would be the same if, instead of P transferring asset A to DRC, such asset was received from a separate unit or a transparent entity of DRC.
