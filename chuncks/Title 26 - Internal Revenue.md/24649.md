####### Analysis.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), C does not have a fixed right to receive the $80,000 until the customer accepts delivery of the computers in 2022. However, under the AFS income inclusion rule, because C has an enforceable right to recover the entire $80,000 of AFS revenue that was reported for 2021 had the customer terminated the contract on the last day of 2021, the entire $80,000 is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" in 2021. Accordingly, the all events test is met for the $80,000 no later than in 2021 and C is required to include $80,000 in gross income in 2021.
