######## Pass-thru partner binds unidentified indirect partners,In general.

(a)-(1)If a pass-thru partner enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to partnership items, that agreement binds all indirect partners holding an interest in that partnership through the pass-thru partner except those indirect partners who have been identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and ยง 301.6223(c)-1 at least 30 days before the date on which the agreement is entered into. A settlement with respect to partnership items includes partnership-level determinations relating to any penalty, addition to tax, and additional amounts that relate to adjustments to partnership items. However, if, in addition to the interest in the partnership held through the pass-thru partner entering into a settlement agreement, an indirect partner holds a separate interest in that partnership, either directly or indirectly through a different pass-thru partner, then the indirect partner shall not be bound by that settlement agreement with respect to the interests held directly or indirectly through a pass-thru partner other than the pass-thru partner entering into the settlement agreement.
