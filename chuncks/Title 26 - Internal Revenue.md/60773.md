###### Attribution of stock ownership.

(iii)For purposes of paragraph (i)(5) of this section, section 318(a) applies to determine stock ownership. Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned by the individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by the individual who holds the unvested option). For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested (as defined by ยง 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option.
