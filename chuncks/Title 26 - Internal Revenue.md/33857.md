####### Mailing of written notice to shareholders.

(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the written notice designating a dividend or part thereof as a capital gain dividend must be mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year of the regulated investment company.

(ii) If a determination (as defined in section 860(e)) after November 6, 1978, increases the excess for the taxable year of the net capital gain over the deduction for capital gains dividends paid, then a regulated investment company may designate all or part of any dividend as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time during the 120-day period immediately following the date of the determination. The aggregate amount designated during this period may not exceed this increase. A dividend may be designated if it is actually paid during the taxable year, is one paid after the close of the taxable year to which section 855 applies, or is a deficiency dividend (as defined in section 860(f)), including a deficiency dividend paid by an acquiring corporation to which section 381(c)(25) applies. The date of a determination is established under ยง 1.860-2(b)(1).
