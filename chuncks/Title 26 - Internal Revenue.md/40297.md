()Under the safe harbor of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, CFC2's holding of Asset A as of each of the December 31, Year 1 tested quarter close and the March 31, Year 2 tested quarter close does not increase the deemed tangible income return of USP, the applicable United States shareholder, for Year 1 or Year 2 because each of the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section is satisfied. The requirement in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section is satisfied because CFC1, a predecessor CFC, held Asset A on September 30, Year 1, a quarter close of CFC1 that occurs on the same date as the last quarter close of CFC2, the acquiring CFC, preceding the December 30, Year 1 acquisition of Asset A. The requirement in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(B) of this section is satisfied because CFC3, a successor CFC, holds Asset A on June 30, Year 2, a quarter close of CFC3 that occurs on the same date as the first quarter close of CFC2 following April 10, Year 2, the date of the subsequent transfer of Asset A. The requirement in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(C) of this section is satisfied because the proportion of stock that USP, the applicable U.S. shareholder, owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) of CFC2, the acquiring CFC, on each of the December 31, Year 1 tested quarter close and the March 31, Year 2 tested quarter close (100%), does not exceed the proportion of the stock that USP owns of either CFC1 (100%) on the preceding quarter close (September 30, Year 1) or of CFC3 (100%) on the succeeding quarter close (June 30, Year 2). Finally, the requirement in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(D) of this section is satisfied because each of CFC1 and CFC3 is a tested income CFC for Year 1 and Year 2, the CFC inclusion years that include the December 31, Year 1 tested quarter close and the March 31, Year 2 tested quarter close. Accordingly, paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to disregard the adjusted basis in Asset A in determining CFC2's aggregate adjusted basis in specified tangible property as of December 31, Year 1, or March 30, Year 2.
