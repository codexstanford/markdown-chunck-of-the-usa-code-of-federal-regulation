###### ยง 1.904-4 Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
####### 3,Disregarded payment from P to FDE.

()The disregarded payment from P to FDE is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to general category U.S. source gross income attributable to P because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to P's $5,000x of general category U.S. source gross services income under ยง 1.861-8. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of general category U.S. source gross income attributable to P is adjusted downward, and the amount of non-passive category U.S. source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted upward, to take the disregarded payment into account. Thus, $300x of P's U.S. source gross income from the performance of Customer A services is attributable to FDE for purposes of this section, and $4,700x of that income is attributable to P.
