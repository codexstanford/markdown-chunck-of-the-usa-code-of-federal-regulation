###### ยง 1.163(j)-5 General rules governing disallowed business interest expense carryforwards for C corporations.
####### Cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation of $0.,Example 1

(C)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, except that T's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation for 2022 is $0. Because the amount of T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that may be deducted by the P group in 2022 may not exceed T's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation, none of T's carryforwards from 2021 may be deducted by the P group in 2022. Because none of T's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are absorbed by the P group in 2022, T's cumulative section 163(j) SRLY limitation remains at $0 entering 2023.
