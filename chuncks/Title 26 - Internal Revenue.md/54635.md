#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Regulations Applying Section 382 With Respect to Testing Dates (and Corporations Joining or Leaving Consolidated Groups) Before June 25, 1999
###### ยง 1.1502-93A Consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) generally applicable for testing dates before June 25, 1999.
####### Adjustment to value.

(2)The value of the loss group (or loss subgroup), as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is adjusted under any rule in section 382 or the regulations thereunder requiring an adjustment to such value for purposes of computing the amount of the section 382 limitation. See, for example, section 382(e)(2) (redemptions and corporate contractions), section 382(l)(1) (certain capital contributions) and section 382(l)(4) (ownership of substantial nonbusiness assets). The value of the loss group (or loss subgroup) determined under this paragraph (b) is also adjusted to the extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of a member. For example, the principles of ยง 1.382-8 (relating to controlled groups of corporations) apply in determining the value of a loss group (or loss subgroup) if, under ยง 1.1502-91A(g)(2), members are not included in the determination whether the group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in loss.
