###### ยง 1.955-4 Definition of less developed country.
####### Designation by Executive order.

(a)For purposes of sections 951 through 964, the term "less developed country" means any foreign country (other than an area within the Sino-Soviet bloc) or any possession of the United States with respect to which, on the first day of the foreign corporation's taxable year, there is in effect an Executive order by the President of the United States designating such country or possession as an economically less developed country for purposes of such sections. Each territory, department, province, or possession of any foreign country other than a country within the Sino-Soviet bloc may be treated as a separate foreign country for purposes of such designation if the territory, department, province, or possession is overseas from the country of which it is a territory, department, province, or possession. Thus, for example, an overseas possession of a foreign country may be designated by Executive order as an economically less developed country even though the foreign country itself has not been designated as an economically less developed country; or the foreign country may be so designated even though the overseas possessions of such country have not been designated as economically less developed countries. The term "possession of the United States", for purposes of section 955(c)(3) and this section, shall be construed to have the same meaning as that contained in paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.957-3.
