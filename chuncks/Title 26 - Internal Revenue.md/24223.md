####### 2,Special rule if Form 720 used to satisfy return requirement.,1,i.e.,

()If, pursuant to ยง 1.7519-2T (a)(3), a partnership or S corporation must use Form 720, "Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return," to satisfy the return requirement of ยง 1.7519-2T (a)(2), then in addition to following the general rules provided in ยง 1.7519-2T, the partnership or S corporation must type or legibly print the words "ACTIVATING BACK-UP ELECTION" on the top of Form 720. A partnership or S corporation that would otherwise file a Form 720 on or before the date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A)() of this section may satisfy the return requirement by including the necessary information on such Form 720. Alternatively, such partnership or S corporation may file an additional Form 720 (a Form 720 separate from the Form 720 it would otherwise file). Thus, for example, if the due date for activating an S corporation's back-up election is November 15, 1988, and the S corporation must file a Form 720 by October 31, 1988, to report manufacturers excise tax for the third quarter of 1988, the S corporation may use that Form 720 to activate its back-up election. Alternatively, the S corporation may file its regular Form 720 that is due October 31, 1988, and file an additional Form 720 by November 15, 1988, activating its back-up election.
