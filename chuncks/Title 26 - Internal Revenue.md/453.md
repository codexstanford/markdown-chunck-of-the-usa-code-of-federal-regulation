() J is a member of C's family as defined in ยง 1.36B-1(d). Because C's required contribution for coverage of C and J exceeds the required contribution percentage of C's and J's household income, under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, X's plan is unaffordable for J. Accordingly, J is not eligible for minimum essential coverage for 2023. However, under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, X's plan is affordable for C, and C is eligible for minimum essential coverage for all months in 2023.
