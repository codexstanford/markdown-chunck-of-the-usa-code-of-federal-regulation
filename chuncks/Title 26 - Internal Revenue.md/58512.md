####### Taxpayers that would otherwise file Form 720 for the second quarter of 1988.

(A)Taxpayers that are required, without regard to this section, to file Form 720 for the second quarter of 1988 (e.g., taxpayers reporting liability for manufacturers excise tax) must file Form 720 by the normal due date of such form for the second quarter of 1988. Thus, such taxpayers must generally file Form 720 on or before July 31, 1988. However, if such taxpayers must also report tax imposed by section 4251 (relating to communications services tax), sections 4261 and 4271 (relating to air transportation tax), or section 4986 (relating to windfall profits tax) for the second quarter of 1988, they must file Form 720 on or before August 31, 1988.
