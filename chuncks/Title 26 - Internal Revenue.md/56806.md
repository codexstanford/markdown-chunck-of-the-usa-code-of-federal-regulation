####### Foreign government.

(F)A foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, and any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing are exempt recipients. A payor may treat a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate provided that its name reasonably indicates that it is a foreign government or provided that it is known to the payor to be a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof (for example, an account held in the name of the "Government of V" may be treated as held by a foreign government).
