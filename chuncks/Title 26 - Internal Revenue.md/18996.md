() S2 directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P is treated as constructively owning an additional 25% of the stock of S1. For purposes of determining the expanded group, P's ownership must be recalculated treating the additional 25% of S1 stock as actually owned. Under the second application of section 318(a)(2)(C) as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P constructively owns an additional 12.5% of the stock of S1 as follows: 25% (P's new attributed ownership of S1) x 100% (S1's ownership of S2) x 50% (S2's ownership of S1) = 12.5%. After two iterations, P's ownership in S1 is 87.5% (50% direct ownership + 25% first order constructive ownership + 12.5% second order constructive ownership) and thus S1 is a member of the expanded group that includes P and S2. Subsequent iterative calculations of P's ownership, treating constructive ownership as actual ownership, would demonstrate that P owns, directly and indirectly, 100% of the stock of S1. P, S1, and S2 therefore constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and P is the expanded group parent.
