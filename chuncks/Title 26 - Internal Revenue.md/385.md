###### ยง 1.32-3 Eligibility requirements after denial of the earned income credit.
####### Demonstration of eligibility.

(c)In the case of a taxpayer to whom paragraph (a) of this section applies, and except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner in the instructions for Form 8862, "Information To Claim Earned Income Credit After Disallowance," no claim for the EIC filed subsequent to the denial is allowed unless the taxpayer properly completes Form 8862, demonstrating eligibility for the EIC, and otherwise is eligible for the EIC. If any item of information on Form 8862 is incorrect or inconsistent with any item on the return, the taxpayer will be treated as not demonstrating eligibility for the EIC. The taxpayer must follow the instructions for Form 8862 to determine the income tax return to which Form 8862 must be attached. If the taxpayer attaches Form 8862 to an incorrect tax return, the taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement that the taxpayer attach Form 8862 to the correct tax return and will, therefore, not be treated as meeting the taxpayer's obligation under paragraph (a) of this section.
