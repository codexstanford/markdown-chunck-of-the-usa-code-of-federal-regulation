###### ยง 1.822-10 Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
####### In general.

(a)In computing taxable investment income for the taxable year, the gross amount of income from interest, the deduction under section 822(c)(1) for wholly tax-exempt interest, and the deduction under section 242 for partially tax-exempt interest, are, under the provisions of section 822(d)(2), each to be decreased by the appropriate amortization of premium and increased by the appropriate accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c). However, only the accrual of discount relating to issue discount will increase the deduction for wholly tax-exempt interest. See section 103. Such amortization and accrual is the same as that provided for life insurance companies by section 818(b)(1), as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 133), and shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of ยง 1.818-3, except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section.
