####### Definition of "deceased partner's distributive share".

(3)For the purpose of this section, the term "deceased partner's distributive share" includes the distributive share of his estate or of any other person succeeding, by reason of his death, to rights with respect to his partnership interest. It does not include any share attributable to a partnership interest which was not held by the deceased partner at the time of his death. Thus, if a deceased partner's estate should acquire an interest in a partnership additional to the interest to which it succeeded upon the death of the deceased partner, the amount of the distributive share attributable to such additional interest acquired by the estate would not be included in computing the "deceased partner's distributive share" of the partnership's ordinary income or loss for the partnership taxable year.
