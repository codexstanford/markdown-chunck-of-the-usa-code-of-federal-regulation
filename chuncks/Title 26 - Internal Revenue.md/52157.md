####### 3,Worthlessness.,Example 6,1

()The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(F)() of this section, except that X's note becomes worthless on December 1 of Year 3 and B has a $100x short-term capital loss under section 165(g) on a separate entity basis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, B's holding period for X's note is aggregated with S's holding period. Thus, B's loss is a long- term capital loss. S takes its $30x gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30x difference between B's $100x loss taken into account and the $70x recomputed loss. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, S's gain is long-term capital gain.
