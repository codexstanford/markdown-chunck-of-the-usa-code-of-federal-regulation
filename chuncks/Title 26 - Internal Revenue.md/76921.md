(b)Upon a final computation of internal revenue taxes properly payable, the amount thereof remaining unpaid shall be paid by the Attorney General to the district director as soon as practicable after the final computation has been made, or, in case the property has been returned to the former owner, by such owner. If the final computation shows that the full amount of internal revenue taxes properly payable is less than the amount previously paid, the difference shall be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of these and other applicable regulations.
