###### ยง 1.163(j)-6 Application of the section 163(j) limitation to partnerships and subchapter S corporations.
####### Analysis.

(ii)Pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-6(d)(2)(ii), solely for purposes of ยง 1.163(j)-6, a buyer of L's units immediately after formation of LM would offset its $500 annual section 704(c) remedial income allocation with $500 of annual section 743(b) adjustment (leaving the buyer with net $500 of section 743(b) deduction). As a result, such buyer would be in the same position as a buyer of M's units. Each buyer would have net deductions of $500 per year, which would not affect ATI before 2022.
