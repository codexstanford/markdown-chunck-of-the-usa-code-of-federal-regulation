###### § 1.855-1 Dividends paid by regulated investment company after close of taxable year.
####### Notice to shareholders.

(e)Section 855(c) provides that in the case of dividends, with respect to which a regulated investment company has made an election under section 855(a), any notice to shareholders required under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, with respect to such amounts, shall be made not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. Thus, the notice requirements of section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4 with respect to capital gain dividends, section 853(c) and § 1.853-3 with respect to allowance to shareholder of foreign tax credit, and section 854(b)(2) and § 1.854-2 with respect to the amount of a distribution which may be treated as a dividend, may be satisfied with respect to amounts to which section 855(a) and this section apply if the notice relating to such amounts is mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. If the notice under section 855(c) relates to an election with respect to any capital gain dividends, such capital gain dividends shall be aggregated by the investment company with the designated capital gain dividends actually paid during the taxable year to which the election applies (not including such dividends with respect to which an election has been made for a prior year under section 855) for the purpose of determining whether the aggregate of the designated capital gain dividends with respect to such taxable year of the company is greater than the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the company. See section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4.
