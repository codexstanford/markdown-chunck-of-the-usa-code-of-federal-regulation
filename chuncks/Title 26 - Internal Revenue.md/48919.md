####### Analysis.

(B)The modification of the land to suit sheep and goat farming activity from its previous use of hog and pig farming, and the significant capital improvements made to land, comprise a significant investment in the business activities on the land. Thus, Partnership D did not hold the land solely for speculative investment. As a result, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the acquisition of the land, the activities conducted on the land, the capital improvements made to the land, and the later disposition of the land for a significant profit are not inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
