####### 2,Disregarded payment from FDE2 to P.

()The disregarded payment from FDE2 to P is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE2 because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE2's $200x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under ยง 1.861-8. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE2 is adjusted downward, and the amount of general category foreign source gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward, to take the $50x disregarded payment into account. Thus, $50x of non-passive category foreign source gross income relating to the Customer A services is attributable to P for purposes of this section, $150x of that income is attributable to FDE2, and $800x of that income remains attributable to FDE1. FDE2's $1,100x of U.S. source royalty income is not adjusted under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section and remains foreign branch category income.
