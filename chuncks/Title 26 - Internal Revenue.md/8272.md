####### Example 9,Facts.

(9)-(i)X and Y are equal partners in partnership PRS, and are not members of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, X and Y each have $120 of outside basis in PRS. Neither X nor Y's share of partnership liabilities exceeds the adjusted basis of its entire interest. In Year 1, X is allocated $20 of excess business interest expense, which reduces its outside basis from $120 to $100. In Year 2, X sells 80 percent of its interest in PRS to Z for $160. Immediately prior to the sale, X's entire PRS interest had a fair market value of $200 and the transferred portion of the interest had a fair market value of $160.
