####### Alternative facts.,Example 1,3,3,Example 1

(C)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (A) of this), except that foreign income for Country F tax purposes is based on combined income (within the meaning of ยง 1.901-2(f)(3)(ii)) of CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2. For purposes of determining an aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of CFC1 under ยง 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are treated as a single foreign payor because all of the items of income, deduction, gain, or loss with respect to CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are included in the earnings and profits of CFC1 for U.S. income tax purposes. For each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will therefore compute a single aggregate basis difference, disqualified tax amount, and aggregate basis difference carryover. The result for CFC2 under the alternative facts is the same as in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)() (paragraph (B)() of this).
