####### entire agreement (as modified)

(vi) Thewith respect to any modification is the agreement consisting of pre-modification terms providing for rights and obligations that are not affected by the modification and post-modification terms providing for rights and obligations that differ from the rights and obligations under the agreement in effect before the modification. For example, if a 10-year rental agreement that provides for rent of $25,000 per year is modified at the end of the 5th year to provide for rent of $30,000 per year in subsequent years, the entire agreement (as modified) provides for a 10-year lease term and provides for rent of $25,000 per year in years 1 through 5 and rent of $30,000 per year in years 6 through 10. The result would be the same if the modification provided for both the increase in rent and the substitution of a new lessee.
