###### Decrease in limit for a plan or coverage with an annual limit.

(C)A group health plan, or group health insurance coverage, that, on March 23, 2010, imposed an overall annual limit on the dollar value of all benefits ceases to be a grandfathered health plan if the plan or health insurance coverage decreases the dollar value of the annual limit (regardless of whether the plan or health insurance coverage also imposed an overall lifetime limit on March 23, 2010 on the dollar value of all benefits). (But see ยง 54.9815-2711, which prohibits all annual dollar limits on essential health benefits for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
