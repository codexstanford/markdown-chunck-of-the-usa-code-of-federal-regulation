####### 3,Asset D,i,Proportionate share.

()-()Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, FC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D for Year 1, multiplied by FC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D for Year 1. Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, FC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, FC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is 50%, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining PRS's section 704(b) income or loss for Year 1 ($40x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, FC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is $250x ($500x x 0.5).
