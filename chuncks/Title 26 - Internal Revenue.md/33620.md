####### Exception for certain cancellable accident and health insurance contracts with installment premiums.

(iv)If an insurance company issues or proportionally reinsures a cancellable accident and health insurance contract (other than a contract with an effective period that exceeds 12 months) for which the gross premium is payable in installments over the effective period of the contract, the company may report the installment premiums (rather than the total gross premium for the contract) in gross premiums written for the earlier of the taxable year in which the installment premiums are due under the terms of the contract or the year in which the installment premiums are received. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting installment premiums for a cancellable accident and health insurance contract only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for the first taxable year in which an installment premium is due or received under the contract does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that adopts this method of reporting installment premiums for a cancellable accident and health contract must use the method for all of its cancellable accident and health insurance contracts with installment premiums.
