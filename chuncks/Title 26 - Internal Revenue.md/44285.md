####### Assumption of indebtedness.

(ii)The assumption by the seller, upon reacquisition of the real property, of any indebtedness to another person which at such time is secured by such property will be considered a payment of money by the seller in connection with the reacquisition. Also, if at the time of reacquisition such property is subject to an indebtedness which is not an indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller, the seller shall be considered to have paid money, in an amount equal to such indebtedness, in connection with the reacquisition of the property. Thus, for example, if at the time of the sale the purchaser executes in connection with the sale a first mortgage to a bank and a second mortgage to the seller and at the time of reacquisition the seller reacquires the property subject to the first mortgage which he does not assume, the seller will be considered to have paid money, in an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the first mortgage, in connection with the reacquisition.
