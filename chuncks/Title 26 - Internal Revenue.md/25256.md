####### Separate election for each trade or business.

(b)An election is made with respect to each trade or business of a taxpayer in connection with which qualified sales (as defined in section 458(b)(5)) of a category of merchandise were made. Magazines, paperbacks, and records are each treated as a separate category of merchandise. If qualified sales of two or more categories of merchandise are made in connection with the same trade or business, then solely for purposes of section 458, each category is treated as a separate trade or business. For example, if a taxpayer makes qualified sales of both magazines and paperbacks in the same trade or business, then solely for purposes of section 458, the qualified sales relating to magazines are considered one trade or business and the qualified sales relating to paperbacks are considered a separate trade or business. Thus, if the taxpayer wishes to account under section 458 for the qualified sales of both magazines and paperbacks, such taxpayer must make a separate election for each category.
