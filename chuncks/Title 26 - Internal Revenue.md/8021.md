####### Analysis.

(B)A has entered into an arrangement with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of section 163(j) or the regulations in this part under section 163(j). Thus, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the Commissioner of the IRS may disregard or recharacterize this transaction to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of section 163(j). In this case, payments of interest on the debt may be recharacterized as payments of interest properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
