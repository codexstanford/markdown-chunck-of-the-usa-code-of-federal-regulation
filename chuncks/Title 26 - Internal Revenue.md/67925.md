###### ยง 53.4941(d)-1 Definition of self-dealing.
####### Applicability of statutory exceptions to indirect self-dealing.

(7)The term "indirect self-dealing" shall not include a transaction involving one or more disqualified persons to which a private foundation is not a party, in any case in which the private foundation, by reason of section 4941(d)(2), could itself engage in such a transaction. Thus, for example, even if a private foundation has control (within the meaning of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) of a corporation, the corporation may pay to a disqualified person, except a government official, reasonable compensation for personal services.
