####### Demonstration relating to credible mortality information.

(iii)If the experience study for a newly-affiliated plan excludes mortality experience data for the period before the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan and the plan fails to demonstrate that it does not have credible mortality information for the plan year under the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, then other plans within the controlled group may continue to use substitute mortality tables only if substitute mortality tables are used for the newly-affiliated plan for the plan year. In such a case, the experience study period for the newly-affiliated plan may consist of a 12-month period.
