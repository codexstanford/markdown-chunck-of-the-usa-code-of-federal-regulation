(3)If a deduction (other than a deduction under section 468A) has been allowed to the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of expected decommissioning costs for a nuclear power plant (a nonconforming deduction) or an amount otherwise includible in income has been excluded from the gross income of the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of such expected decommissioning costs (a nonconforming exclusion), the deduction allowed for a special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund maintained with respect to the plant is reduced. In the case of a single special transfer of the full eligible amount, the reduction is equal to the aggregate amount of all nonconforming deductions and nonconforming exclusions. In the case of a transfer of less than the full eligible amount, the reduction is a ratable portion of such aggregate amount.
