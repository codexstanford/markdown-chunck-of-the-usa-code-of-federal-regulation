######## Computation of the penalty; aggregate dollar amount of the items required to be reported correctly.,i.e.,

(5)The aggregate dollar amount used in computing the penalty under this paragraph (f) is the amount that is not reported or is reported incorrectly. If the intentional disregard relates to a dollar amount, the statutory percentage is applied to the difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount required to be reported correctly. If the intentional disregard relates to any other item on the return, the statutory percentage is applied to the aggregate amount of items required to be reported correctly. In determining the aggregate amount of items required to be reported correctly, no item shall be taken into account more than once. For example, if a filer willfully fails to file a Form 1099-INT on which $800 of interest and $160 of Federal income tax withheld (backup withholding) is required to be reported, only the $800 amount is taken into account in computing the penalty.
