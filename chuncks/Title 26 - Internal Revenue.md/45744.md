###### ยง 1.1250-1 Gain from dispositions of certain depreciable realty.
####### Treatment of partnerships and partners.

(f)If a partnership disposes of section 1250 property, the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) by the partnership and by a partner shall be determined in a manner consistent with the principles provided in paragraph (e) of ยง 1.1245-1. Thus, for example, a partner's distributive share of gain recognized by the partnership under section 1250(a) shall be determined in the same manner as his distributive share of gain recognized by the partnership under section 1245(a)(1) is determined, and, if required, additional depreciation in respect of section 1250 property shall be allocated to the partner in the same manner as the adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis of section 1245 property are allocated to the partner. For a further example, if on the date a partner acquires his partnership interest by way of a sale or exchange the partnership owns section 1250 property and an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property) is in effect with respect to the partnership, then such partner's additional depreciation in respect of such property on such date is deemed to be zero. For limitation on the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) in respect of a partnership and for the amount of additional depreciation in respect of partnership property after certain transactions, see paragraph (f) of ยง 1.1250-3. For treatment of section 1250 property as an unrealized receivable, see section 751(c).
