P incurs R&E expenditures to update software code and write new software code to maintain the website and develop new products that are incorporated into the website. P's activities consist of services that fall within SIC code category 737 (computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services). P sells space on its website for businesses to advertise to its user base in exchange for a fee. P's technology allows it to collect data on users and to use that data to effectively target advertisements. P does not grant rights to the technology or other intangible property to the businesses advertising on its website. In Year 1, P incurs R&E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174. All the research and experimentation is performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, P earns gross receipts of $200,000x from the sale of advertisements, all of which gives rise to U.S. source gross income.
