####### Effect of election.

(5)If an election to consolidate a chain of export trade corporations is made for a taxable year of a United States shareholder, such election shall, except as provided in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, be binding on such shareholder for such taxable year and for all succeeding taxable years. If, in a subsequent taxable year of the United States shareholder, an export trade corporation for the first time qualifies as a second-tier or third-tier corporation in such chain on the last day of the taxable year of the top-tier corporation which ends in or with the subsequent taxable year of such shareholder, the shareholder's interest in such export trade corporation shall be included in the consolidation to which the election applies, but only if such export trade corporation as of such last day uses the same taxable year and has the same elections under section 970(c)(4) and ยง 1.970-2 in force, or not in force, as the case may be, as such top-tier corporation. The United States shareholder shall, with respect to such additional export trade corporation, submit with his return for such subsequent taxable year the statement described in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph.
