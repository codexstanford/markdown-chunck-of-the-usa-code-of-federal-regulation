##### Items Not Deductible
###### ยง 1.280H-1T Limitation on certain amounts paid to employee-owners by personal service corporations electing alternative taxable years (temporary).
####### Disallowance inapplicable for certain purposes.

(3)The disallowance of deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply for purposes of subchapter G of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to corporations used to avoid income tax on shareholders) nor for determining whether the compensation of employee-owners is reasonable. Thus, for example, in determining whether a personal service corporation is subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, deductions disallowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are treated as allowed in computing accumulated taxable income.
