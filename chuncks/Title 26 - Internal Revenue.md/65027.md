In addition, the payor must withhold under section 3406 on any withdrawals made after the close of 7 business days after the date the awaiting-TIN certification is received and before the earlier of the date that the payor receives a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee, the date the account is closed (in which case the payor must withhold on any reportable payment made at the time the account or relationship is closed), or the date withholding under section 3406 starts on all reportable payments made to the account, instrument, or relationship. All cash withdrawals in an amount up to the reportable payments made from the day after the date of receipt of the awaiting-TIN certification to the date of withdrawal are treated as reportable payments.
