####### Example 2: Determining deemed sale EC gain attributable to inventory property under the material change in circumstances rule,1,Facts.,1,Example 1

(B)-()The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section (the facts ofin this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)), except that at the beginning of year 3 (PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale), PRS started a new business in Country B (the Country B Business) to take advantage of favorable market prospects for its products in Country B. For the Country B Business, PRS sells its inventory property through its Country B office for consumption in Country B; PRS's Country B office materially participates in each such sale. The gain or loss from the inventory sold through PRS's Country B office is foreign source gain or loss. Also, at the beginning of year 3, PRS substantially reduced its U.S. Business as a result of market factors. As a result of these changes in year 3, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Country A Business and Country B Business (collectively, the Foreign Businesses) beginning on the date in which these changes occurred; accordingly, 5% of PRS' inventory property is sold in its U.S. Business after these changes. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $15x and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during that period is $30x; for year 3, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $9.5x, and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property in Year 3 is $10x.
