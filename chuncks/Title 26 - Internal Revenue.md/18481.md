###### ยง 1.381(c)(23)-1 Investment credit carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
####### Computation of carryovers when date of distribution or transfer is not on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.

(e)(1) If the date of distribution or transfer occurs on any day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the amount which may be added to the amount allowable as a credit by section 38 for the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer (hereinafter called the "year of acquisition") shall be determined in the following manner. The year of acquisition shall be considered as though it were 2 taxable years. The first of such 2 taxable years shall be referred to in this paragraph as the preacquisition part year and shall begin with the beginning of the year of acquisition and end with the close of the date of distribution or transfer. The second of such 2 taxable years shall be referred to in this paragraph as the postacquisition part year and shall begin with the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end with the close of the year of acquisition.

(2) The excess limitation for the year of acquisition (i.e., the excess of the limitation based on the amount of tax for such year over the amount of credit earned for such year) shall be divided between the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each. Thus, if in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies Y Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, acquires the assets of X Corporation on June 30, 1975, and Y Corporation has an excess limitation of $36,500 for its calendar year 1975, then the excess limitation for the preacquisition part year would be $18,100 ($36,500 x 181/365) and the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year would be $18,400 ($36,500 x 184/365).

(3) An unused credit of the acquiring corporation shall be carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the preacquisition part year and then carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year, whereas an unused credit of the distributor or transferor corporation shall not be carried to the preacquisition part year but shall only be carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year. For special rule relating to carryovers from taxable years ending before January 1, 1971, to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.

(4) Though considered as two separate taxable years for purposes of this paragraph, the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year are treated as one taxable year in determining the years to which an unused credit is carried under section 46(b)(1).

(5) The preceding subparagraphs may be illustrated by the following example:

(6) If the year of acquisition is a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1970, and if there is an unused credit of the distributor or transferor corporation or of the acquiring corporation arising in an unused credit year ending before January 1, 1971, which may be carried to such year of acquisition (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section), then in applying subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph, in lieu of dividing the excess limitation for the year of acquisition between the preacquisition and postacquisition part years, only the limitation based on the amount of tax for such year (i.e., without reduction for the credit earned) shall be divided between the preacquisition and postacquisition part years. If there is also an unused credit arising in an unused credit year ending after December 31, 1970, which may be carried to the year of acquisition, then for the purpose of determining the amount of such unused credit which may be taken into account for such year of acquisition, the credit earned for the year of acquisition shall first be applied against the limitation based on amount of tax for the preacquisition part year (reduced by any investment credit carryovers to such part year from unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971) and the excess, if any, shall then be applied against the limitation based on amount of tax for the postacquisition part year (also reduced by any investment credit carryovers to such part year from unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971).

(7) Subparagraph (6) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

(8) If the year of acquisition is a taxable year to which the limitation provided in ยง 1.46-2(b)(2) (relating to 20- percent limitation on carryovers and carrybacks to certain taxable years) applies, then for purposes of applying such limitation the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year shall each be considered a fractional part of a year, but, if the date of distribution or transfer is not on the last day of a month, the entire month in which the date of distribution or transfer occurs shall be considered as included in the preacquisition part year and no portion thereof shall be considered as included in the postacquisition part year.

(9) If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the investment credit carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the manner in which the unused credits of the distributor or transferor corporations shall be applied shall be determined consistently with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of ยง 1.381(c)(1)-2.
