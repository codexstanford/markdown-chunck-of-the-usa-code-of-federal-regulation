Because the total tentative carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section of $400x ($200x in each of the foreign branch and passive categories) exceeds the net operating loss carryover amount, the tentative carryover from each separate category is reduced proportionately by $100x ($200x x $200x/$400x).
