####### ยง 301.7216-3 Disclosure or use permitted only with the taxpayer's consent.
######## Special rules,Multiple disclosures within a single consent form or multiple uses within a single consent form.

(c)-(1)A taxpayer may consent to multiple uses within the same written document, or multiple disclosures within the same written document. A single written document, however, cannot authorize both uses and disclosures; rather one written document must authorize the uses and another separate written document must authorize the disclosures. Furthermore, a consent that authorizes multiple disclosures or multiple uses must specifically and separately identify each disclosure or use. See ยง 301.7216-3(a)(3)(iii) for an exception to this rule for certain taxpayers.
