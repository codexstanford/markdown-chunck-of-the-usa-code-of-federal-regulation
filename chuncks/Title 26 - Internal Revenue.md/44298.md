###### § 1.1038-2 Reacquisition and resale of property used as a principal residence.
####### Transactions not included.

(b)(1) If with respect to the original sale of the property there was no nonrecognition of gain under section 1034 and an election under section 121 is not in effect, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition. Thus, for example, if in the case of a taxpayer not entitled to the benefit of section 121 there is no gain on the original sale of the property, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply even though a redetermination of gain under this section would result in the nonrecognition of gain on the sale under section 1034. Also, if in the case of such a taxpayer there was gain on the original sale of the property but after the application of section 1034 all of such gain was recognized, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition.

(2) If the original sale of the property was not eligible for the treatment provided by section 121 and section 1034, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition of the property even though the resale of such property is eligible for the treatment provided by either or both of sections 121 and 1034.
