()Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset A and Asset B, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is determined entirely by reference to its proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $80x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A, and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $100x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset B.
