###### ยง 1.6164-3 Computation of the amount of reduction of the tax previously determined.
####### Tax previously determined.

(a)The taxpayer is to determine the amount of the reduction, attributable to the expected carryback, in the aggregate of the taxes previously determined for taxable years prior to the taxable year of the expected net operating loss. The tax previously determined is to be ascertained in accordance with the method prescribed in section 1314(a). Thus, the tax previously determined will be the tax shown on the return as filed, increased by any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies prior to the date of the filing of the statement, and decreased by any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid prior to such date. Any items as to which the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer are in disagreement at the time of the filing of the statement shall be taken into account in ascertaining the tax previously determined only if, and to the extent that, they were reported in the return, or were reflected in any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, or in any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid, prior to the date of the filing of the statement. The tax previously determined will reflect the foreign tax credit and the credit for tax withheld at source provided in section 32.
