####### Example 5.

(v)The facts are the same as in example (4). Assume that the fair market value of the assets Ltransferred to Lwas $10 million on January 1, 2020 and that Lacquired no other assets prior to June 30, 2021. Assume further that on January 1, 2021, Lacquires (other than in the ordinary course of its trade or business) assets having a fair market value of $40 million from L, an unrelated life company. On June 30, 2021, Ltransfers those assets to L. Lbecomes ineligible on June 30, 2021. Since by fair market values, 80 percent (in other words, 40/50) of L's assets are attributable to special acquisitions, Lhas undergone a disproportionate asset acquisition at that time. See paragraph (b)(12)(viii)(B), (D), and (F) of this section.
