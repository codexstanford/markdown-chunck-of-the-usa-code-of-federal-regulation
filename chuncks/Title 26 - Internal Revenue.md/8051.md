####### ATI.

(iii)D's ATI in Year 2 is $340x, which is determined by adding D's business interest expense, or $100x, to D's tentative taxable income, or $240x ($240x + $100x). Because disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are not taken into account in determining tentative taxable income, there is no corresponding adjustment for disallowed business interest expense carryforwards in calculating ATI. Therefore, there is no adjustment for D's $340x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward in calculating D's ATI. D has no other adjustments to determine ATI.
