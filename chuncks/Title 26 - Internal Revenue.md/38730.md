###### § 1.905-1 When credit for foreign income taxes may be taken.
####### Relation-back rule for adjustments to taxes claimed as a credit in year accrued.,Example 5

(ii)Additional tax paid as a result of a change in the foreign tax liability, including additional tax paid when a contest with a foreign tax authority is resolved, relates back and is considered to accrue at the end of the foreign taxable year with respect to which the tax is imposed (the "relation-back year"). Additional withholding tax paid as a result of a change in the amount of an item of foreign gross income (such as pursuant to a foreign transfer pricing adjustment) also relates back and is considered to accrue in the year in which the payment from which the additional tax is withheld is made (or considered to have been made under foreign tax law). Foreign income taxes that are not paid within 24 months after the close of the taxable year in which they were accrued are treated as refunded pursuant to § 1.905-3(a); when subsequently paid, the foreign income taxes are allowed as a credit in the relation-back year. See § 1.905-3(b)(1)(ii)(E) (). For special rules that apply to determine when foreign income tax is considered to accrue in the case of certain ownership and entity classification changes, see §§ 1.336-2(g)(3)(ii), 1.338-9(d), 1.901-2(f)(5), and 1.1502-76.
