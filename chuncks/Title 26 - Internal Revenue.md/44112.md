(ii) Although floors are listed as an example of a structural component under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the raised flooring system installed to facilitate the operation of E's 3D printer is not a constituent part of, and integrated into, an inherently permanent structure as required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and, therefore, is not flooring as listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Thus, the raised flooring must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component of E's building (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section) using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)() through () of this section. The raised flooring-

(A) Is installed and removed quickly and with little expense;

(B) Is designed to be moved and is not designed specifically for the particular building of which it is a part;

(C) Is not damaged, and the building is not damaged, upon its removal; and

(D) Was installed during construction of the building.
