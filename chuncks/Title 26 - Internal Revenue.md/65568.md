() If on any day within an eighth-monthly period the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $100,000 or more, the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution on the first banking day after that day. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid prior to that day shall not be taken into account if a deposit was required under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Taxes deposited on any given day with respect to wages paid on that day do not reduce the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated on that day for purposes of determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that day.
