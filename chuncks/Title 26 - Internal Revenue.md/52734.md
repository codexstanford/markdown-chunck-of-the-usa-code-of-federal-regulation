()As a result of the P Group's extended split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any portion of the extended carryback period (that is, any taxable year prior to Year 5). See paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)()() of this section. As a result, the X Group absorbs $200 of T's $600 loss in Year 5, and the remaining $400 ($600-$200) is carried to taxable years of the P Group. See ยง 1.1502-21(b)(1).
