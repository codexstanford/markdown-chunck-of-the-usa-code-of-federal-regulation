###### § 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Eligible and ineligible life companies.

(3)If any life company was a member of an affiliated group of life companies (as defined in section 1504(c)(1)) but is ineligible for a taxable year for which the election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective, that year is not a separate return year merely by reason of the election under section 1504(c)(2) in applying §§ 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-19 to transactions occurring in prior consolidated return years of that affiliated group. In addition, if more than one ineligible life member of the group (as defined in section 1504(c)(1)) joined in the filing of a consolidated return in the taxable year immediately preceding the year for which the election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective and, solely as a result of the election, one of the ineligible life members becomes the common parent of such a group (section 1504(c)(1)), the group must continue to file a consolidated return. For example, assume that Lowns all of the stock of Sand all of the stock of L. Lowns the stock of L. L, L, and Lare life companies and Sis a nonlife company. Assume further that in 2019, L, L, and Lfile a consolidated return but Lmakes the election under section 1504(c)(2) for 2020 and Land Lare ineligible. Land Lmust continue to file a consolidated return in 2020. Moreover, Lcould elect in 2020 to file a consolidated return (section 1504(c)(1)) with Leven if they did not file a consolidated return in 2019 with L.
