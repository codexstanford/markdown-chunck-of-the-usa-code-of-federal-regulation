####### Transfer to which section 381 applies.

(iii)This paragraph (b)(2)(iii) applies to any acquisition to which section 381(a) applies if, immediately after the acquisition, the acquiror's principal method of accounting for bad debts (determined under § 1.381(c)(4)-1(c)(2)) with respect to its banking business is the specific charge-off method. In applying § 1.381(c)(4)-1(c)(2) for this purpose, the following rules apply: A transferor large bank is considered to use the specific charge-off method for all of its loans immediately before the acquisition; an acquiror is considered to use a reserve method for all of its loans immediately before the acquisition; and all banking businesses of the acquiror immediately after the acquisition are treated as one integrated business. See §§ 1.585-6(c)(3) and 1.585-7(d)(2) for rules on the treatment of assets acquired from large banks in section 381(a) transactions.
