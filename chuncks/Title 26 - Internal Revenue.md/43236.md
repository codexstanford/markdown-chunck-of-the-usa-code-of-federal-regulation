###### ยง 1.993-1 Definition of qualified export receipts.
####### Relation to leases.

(5)If the gross receipts for services which are related and subsidiary to a lease of property have been prepaid at any time for all such services which are to be performed before the end of the term of such lease, then as of the time of the prepayment the rules in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (relating to prepayment of lease receipts) will determine whether prepaid services under this subdivision are qualified export receipts. Thus, for example if it is reasonably expected that leased property will be export property for the first year of the term of the lease but will not be export property for the second year of the term, prepaid gross receipts for related and subsidiary services to be furnished in the first year may be qualified export receipts. However, any prepaid gross receipts for such services to be furnished in the second year cannot be qualified export receipts.
