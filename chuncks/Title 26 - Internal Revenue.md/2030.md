(ii)A plan that meets the requirements of section 401(a) may receive contributions of TRASOP securities as well as other contributions. If the other contributions continue on a permanent basis, the plan's qualification under section 401(a) will not be adversely affected merely because TRASOP securities cease to be contributed to it. The discontinuance of TRASOP contributions does not alter the requirement that past TRASOP contributions remain invested in employer securities. See paragraph (e)(10) of this section.
