####### Special rule for certain substitute dividend payments.

(3)In the case of a dividend equivalent under section 871(m) paid pursuant to a securities lending transaction described in section 1058 (or a substantially similar transaction), or pursuant to a sale-repurchase transaction, a withholding agent may offset its obligation to withhold under chapter 4 for amounts withheld by another withholding agent under chapters 3 and 4 with respect to the same underlying security in such a transaction, but only to the extent that there is sufficient evidence as required under chapter 3 that tax was actually withheld on a prior dividend equivalent paid to the withholding agent or a prior withholding agent with respect to the same underlying security in such transaction.
