####### Leases of property for ultimate use outside the United States.

(v)For purposes of subdivision (4)(i) of this paragraph, a lessee of property is deemed to use property ultimately outside the United States during a taxable year of the lessor if the property is used predominantly outside the United States (as defined in subdivision (4)(vi) of this paragraph) by the lessee during the portion of the lessor's taxable year which is included within the term of the lease. A determination as to whether the ultimate use of leased property satisfies the requirements of this subdivision is made for each taxable year of the lessor. Thus, leased property may be used predominantly outside the United States for a taxable year of the lessor (and thus, constitute export property if the remaining requirements of this section are met) even if the property is not used predominantly outside the United States in earlier taxable years or later taxable years of the lessor.
