###### ยง 1.7702-2 Attained age of the insured under a life insurance contract.
####### Contract insuring a single life.

(b)(1) If a contract insures the life of a single individual, either of the following two ages may be treated as the attained age of the insured with respect to that contract-

(i) The insured's age determined by reference to the individual's actual birthday as of the date of determination (actual age); or

(ii) The insured's age determined by reference to contract anniversary (rather than the individual's actual birthday), so long as the age assumed under the contract (contract age) is within 12 months of the actual age as of that date.

(2) Once determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attained age with respect to an individual insured under a contract changes annually. Moreover, the same attained age must be used for purposes of applying sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.
