####### Description of qualified New York Liberty Zone property,In general.

(2)-(i)Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2) if the property is-

(A) Described in ยง 1.168(k)-1(b)(2)(i); or

(B) Nonresidential real property or residential rental property depreciated under section 168, but only to the extent it rehabilitates real property damaged, or replaces real property destroyed or condemned, as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Property is treated as replacing destroyed or condemned property if, as part of an integrated plan, the property replaces real property that is included in a continuous area that includes real property destroyed or condemned. For purposes of this section, real property is considered as destroyed or condemned only if an entire building or structure was destroyed or condemned as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Otherwise, the real property is considered damaged real property. For example, if certain structural components (for example, walls, floors, and plumbing fixtures) of a building are damaged or destroyed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but the building is not destroyed or condemned, then only costs related to replacing the damaged or destroyed structural components qualify under this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B).
