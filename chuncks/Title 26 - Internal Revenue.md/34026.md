####### In general.

(a)In computing the percentage requirements in section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B), the term "interest" includes only an amount which constitutes compensation for the use or forbearance of money. For example, a fee received or accrued by a lender which is in fact a charge for services performed for a borrower rather than a charge for the use of borrowed money is not includable as interest.
