####### Requirement of certification by seller.

(a)Taxpayers claiming the credit should attach Form 5405, Credit for Purchase or Construction of New Principal Residence, to their tax returns on which the credit is claimed. Except in the case of self-construction (as defined in ยง 1.44-5(d)), taxpayers must attach a certification by the seller that construction of the residence began before March 26, 1975, and that the purchase price is the lowest price at which the residence was offered for sale after February 28, 1975. For purposes of section 44(e)(4) and this section, the term "price" generally does not include costs of acquisition other than the amount of the consideration from the purchaser to the seller. However, for rules relating to adjustments in price due to changes in financing terms and closing costs see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
