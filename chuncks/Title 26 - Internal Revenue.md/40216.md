####### Depreciation not capitalized to inventory.

(B)Because none of the depreciation with respect to the trucks is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, FS's dual use ratio with respect to the trucks is determined entirely by reference the depreciation deduction with respect to the trucks. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, FS's dual use ratio with respect to the trucks for Year 1 is 75%, which is FS's depreciation deduction with respect to the trucks that is allocated and apportioned to gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) for Year 1 ($15x), divided by the total amount of FS's depreciation deduction with respect to the trucks for Year 1 ($20x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $3,000x ($4,000x x 0.75) of FS's average adjusted bases in the trucks is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining FS's qualified business asset investment for Year 1.
