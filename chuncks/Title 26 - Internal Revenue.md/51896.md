Such report must be made on Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and filed on or before March 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the withholdable payment was made. A withholding agent is not required to report under this paragraph (i)(2) on a withholdable payment made to a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is allocated to a payee that is a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners on an FFI withholding statement when the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI includes on the statement the certification described in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)()(), provided that the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. In the case of an entity to which the preceding sentence does not apply that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary receiving a withholdable payment allocable to a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners, the entity is not required to report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2) if it provides to the withholding agent from which it receives the payment documentation sufficient for the withholding agent to report information with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2), provided that the intermediary or flow-through entity does not know or have reason to know that the withholding agent does not report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2). The report must contain the following information-

(i) Name of the NFFE that is owned by a substantial U.S. owner;

(ii) The name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner of such NFFE;

(iii) For the period from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the total of all withholdable payments made to the NFFE and, with respect to payments made after the 2014 calendar year, the total of all withholdable payments made to the NFFE during the calendar year; and
