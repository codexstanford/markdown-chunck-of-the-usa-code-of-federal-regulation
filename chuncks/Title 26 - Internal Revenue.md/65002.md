####### Rule for determining when the payor receives a taxpayer identification number or certificate from a payee.

(f)In determining whether a payee has failed to provide a taxpayer identification number or any certification to a payor (including a Form W-8 or substitute form), a payor is required to process the taxpayer identification number or certification within 30 days after the payor receives the taxpayer identification number or certification from the payee or in certain cases, from a broker. Thus, the payor may take up to 30 days to treat the taxpayer identification number or a certificate as having been received.
