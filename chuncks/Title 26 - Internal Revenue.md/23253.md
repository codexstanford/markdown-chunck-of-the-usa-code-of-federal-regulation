####### Distributions from applicable defined benefit plans under section 411(a)(13)(C),In general.

(5)-(i)In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount of a future distribution is based on an interest adjustment applied to the current accumulated benefit, then the amount of that distribution is determined by projecting the future interest credits or equivalent amount under the plan's interest crediting rules using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Thus, if a plan provides for a single-sum distribution equal to the balance of a participant's hypothetical account under a cash balance plan, then the amount of that future distribution is equal to the projected account balance at the expected date of payment determined using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
