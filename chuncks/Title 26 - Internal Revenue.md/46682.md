####### Temporary unavailability of a qualified inflation index.

(5)Notwithstanding any other rule of this section, an inflation-indexed debt instrument may provide for a substitute value of the qualified inflation index if and when the publication of the value of the qualified inflation index is temporarily delayed. The substitute value may be determined by the issuer under any reasonable method. For example, if the CPI-U is not reported for a particular month, the debt instrument may provide that a substitute value may be determined by increasing the last reported value by the average monthly percentage increase in the qualified inflation index over the preceding twelve months. The use of a substitute value does not result in a reissuance of the debt instrument.
