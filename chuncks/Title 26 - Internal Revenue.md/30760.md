###### ยง 1.642(c)-7 Transitional rules with respect to pooled income funds.
####### Amendment requirements.

(c)(1) A fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and possessing the initial characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section on the date prescribed therein shall be treated as a pooled income fund if it is amended to meet all the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and ยง 1.642(c)-5 before January 1, 1972, or, if later, on or before the 30th day after the date on which any judicial proceedings commenced before January 1, 1972, which are required to amend its governing instrument or any other instrument which does not permit it to meet such requirements, become final. However, see paragraph (d) of this section for limitation on the period in which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.

(2) In addition, if the transferred property described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is commingled with other property, the transferred property must be separated on or before the date specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph from the other property and allocated to the fund in accordance with the transferred property's percentage share of the fair market value of the total commingled property on the date of separation. The percentage share shall be the ratio which the fair market value of the transferred property on the date of separation bears to the fair market value of the total commingled property on that date and shall be computed in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of ยง 1.642(c)-5. The property which is so allocated to the fund shall be treated as property received from transfers which meet the requirements of section 642(c)(5), and such transfers shall be treated as made on the dates on which the properties giving rise to such allocation were transferred to the fund by the respective donors. The property so allocated to the fund must be representative of all the commingled property other than securities the income from which is exempt from tax under subtitle A of the Code; compensating increases in other commingled property allocated to the fund shall be made where such tax-exempt securities are not allocated to the fund. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
