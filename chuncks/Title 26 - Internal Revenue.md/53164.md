####### Allocation of income attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift.

(6)For purposes of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a thrift institution's allocable share of the income attributable to functionally related activities of a nonthrift is determined by multiplying that income by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the cumulative reductions referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section (minus the cumulative increases under paragraph (f)(2) of this section) made on account of that nonthrift for the thrift and the denominator is the sum of such cumulative reductions (minus such cumulative increases) made on account of that nonthrift for all thrifts.
