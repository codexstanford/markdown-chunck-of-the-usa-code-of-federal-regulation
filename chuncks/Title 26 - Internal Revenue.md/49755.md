####### Withholding foreign partnerships,Reliance on claim of withholding foreign partnership status.

(2)-(i)A withholding foreign partnership is a foreign partnership that has entered into an agreement with the IRS, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, with respect to distributions and guaranteed payments it makes to its partners. A withholding agent that can reliably associate a payment with a certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section may treat the person to whom it makes the payment as a withholding foreign partnership for purposes of withholding under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code, information reporting under chapter 61 of the Code, backup withholding under section 3406, and withholding under other provisions of the Code. Furnishing such a certificate is in lieu of transmitting to a withholding agent withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation for its partners. Although the withholding foreign partnership generally will be required to obtain withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation from its partners pursuant to its agreement with the IRS, it generally will not be required to attach such documentation to its withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate to the extent it is permitted to act as a withholding foreign partnership with respect to the payment under its agreement. In addition, the IRS may permit a foreign partnership to act as a qualified intermediary under ยง 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D) with respect to its partners in appropriate circumstances.
