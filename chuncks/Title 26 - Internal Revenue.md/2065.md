###### ยง 1.46-8 Requirements for taxpayers electing additional one-percent investment credit (TRASOP's).
####### Operational failure to comply.

(iii)Operational failures are corrected by undoing the defective transaction and by making the plan and the participants whole. If the value of TRASOP securities transferred to the TRASOP is less than the amount of the additional credit, the corporation must make up any resulting funding deficiency within the correction period. This is done, for example, by contributing additional TRASOP securities plus an amount equal to the dividends or interest that would have been paid between the time that the TRASOP securities should have been transferred and the actual time for the transfer. The contribution of additional TRASOP securities is based on their value under paragraph (b)(7) of this section as of the date by which they were required to be transferred to the plan. An electing corporation fails to meet an obligation undertaken under this section if, for example, it fails to comply with paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
