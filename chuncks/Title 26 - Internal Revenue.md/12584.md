###### ยง 1.243-3 Certain dividends from foreign corporations.
####### In general.

(a)(1) In determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), section 243(d) provides that a dividend received from a foreign corporation after December 31, 1959, shall be treated as a dividend from a domestic corporation which is subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code, but only to the extent that such dividend is out of earnings and profits accumulated by a domestic corporation during a period with respect to which such domestic corporation was subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law). Thus, for example, if a domestic corporation accumulates earnings and profits during a period or periods with respect to which it is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) and subsequently such domestic corporation reincorporates in a foreign country, any dividends paid out of such earnings and profits after such reincorporation are eligible for the deduction provided in section 243(a) (1) and (2).

(2) Section 243(d) and this section do not apply to dividends paid out of earnings and profits accumulated (i) by a corporation organized under the China Trade Act, 1922, (ii) by a domestic corporation during any period with respect to which such corporation was exempt from taxation under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc. organizations) or 521 (relating to farmers' cooperative associations), or (iii) by a domestic corporation during any period to which section 931 (relating to income from sources within possessions of the United States), as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, applied.
