####### Calculation of adjusted taxable income.

(iv)For purposes of calculating the ATI for a consolidated group, the tentative taxable income is the consolidated group's consolidated taxable income, determined under ยง 1.1502-11 but without regard to any carryforwards or disallowances under section 163(j). Further, for purposes of calculating the ATI of the group, intercompany items and corresponding items are disregarded to the extent that they offset in amount. Thus, for example, certain portions of the intercompany items and corresponding items of a group member engaged in a non-excepted trade or business will not be included in ATI to the extent that the counterparties to the relevant intercompany transactions are engaged in one or more excepted trades or businesses.
