###### ยง 1.6050S-3 Information reporting for payments of interest on qualified education loans.
####### Qualified education loan certification.

(2)If a loan is not subsidized, guaranteed, financed, or is not otherwise treated as a student loan under a program of the Federal, state, or local government or an eligible educational institution, a payee must request a certification from the payor that the loan will be used solely to pay for qualified higher education expenses. A payee may use Form W-9S, "Request for Student's or Borrower's Social Security Number and Certification," to obtain the certification. A payee may establish an electronic system for payors to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. A payee may also develop a separate form to obtain the payor certification or may incorporate the certification into other forms customarily used by the payee, such as loan applications, provided the certification is clearly set forth. If the certification is not received, the loan is not a qualified education loan for purposes of section 6050S and this section.
