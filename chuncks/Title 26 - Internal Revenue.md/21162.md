###### ยง 1.410(b)-5 Average benefit percentage test.
####### Alternative methods of determining compensation.

(6)Employee benefit percentages may be determined on the basis of any definition of compensation that satisfies ยง 1.414(s)-1(d) (without regard to whether the definition satisfies ยง 1.414(s)-1(d)(3)), provided that the same definition is used for all employees and it is reasonable to believe that the definition does not result in an average benefit percentage that is significantly higher than the average benefit percentage that would be determined had employee benefit percentages been determined using a definition of compensation that also satisfies ยง 1.414(s)-1(d)(3).
