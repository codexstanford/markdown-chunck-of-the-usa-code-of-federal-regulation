(ii)The same facts as in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section () apply, except that the gift cards have an expiration date 12 months from the date of sale, E does not accept expired gift cards, and E includes unredeemed gift cards in AFS revenue for the taxable year in which the cards expire. Because E tracks the sale date and the expiration date of the gift cards for its AFS, E can determine the extent to which advance payments are taken into account as AFS revenue for the taxable year of receipt. Therefore, E meets the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and may elect the deferral method for these advance payments.
