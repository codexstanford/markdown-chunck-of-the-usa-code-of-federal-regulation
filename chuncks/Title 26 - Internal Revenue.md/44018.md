###### ยง 1.1017-1 Basis reductions following a discharge of indebtedness.
####### Depreciable property.,depreciable property

(e)For purposes of this section, the termmeans any property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation or amortization, but only if the basis reduction would reduce the amount of depreciation or amortization which otherwise would be allowable for the period immediately following such reduction. Thus, for example, a lessor cannot reduce the basis of leased property where the lessee's obligation in respect of the property will restore to the lessor the loss due to depreciation during the term of the lease, since the lessor cannot take depreciation in respect of such property.
