###### ยง 1.263A-11 Accumulated production expenditures.
####### Property used to produce designated property,In general.

(d)-(1)Accumulated production expenditures include the adjusted bases (or portion thereof) of any equipment, facilities, or other similar assets, used in a reasonably proximate manner for the production of a unit of designated property during any measurement period in which the asset is so used. Examples of assets used in a reasonably proximate manner include machinery and equipment used directly or indirectly in the production process, such as assembly-line structures, cranes, bulldozers, and buildings. A taxpayer apportions the adjusted basis of an asset used in the production of more than one unit of designated property in a measurement period among such units of designated property using reasonable criteria corresponding to the use of the asset, such as machine hours, mileage, or units of production. If an asset used in a reasonably proximate manner for the production of a unit of designated property is temporarily idle (within the meaning of ยง 1.263A-1(e)(3)(iii)(E)) for an entire measurement period, the adjusted basis of the asset is excluded from the accumulated production expenditures for the unit during that measurement period. Notwithstanding this paragraph (d)(1), the portion of the depreciation allowance for equipment, facilities, or any other asset that is capitalized with respect to a unit of designated property in accordance with ยง 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(I) is included in accumulated production expenditures without regard to the extent of use under this paragraph (d)(1) (i.e., without regard to whether the asset is used in a reasonably proximate manner for the production of the unit of designated property).
