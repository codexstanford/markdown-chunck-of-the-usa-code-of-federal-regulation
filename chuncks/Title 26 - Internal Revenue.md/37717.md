####### allocated basis difference adjustment

(6) The termmeans an adjustment to a section 901(m) payor's allocated basis difference with respect to an RFA and a foreign income tax for a U.S. taxable year. If the RFA has a positive basis difference, the allocated basis difference adjustment is equal to the lesser of the allocated basis difference or the portion of any unallocated CAA gain that corresponds to the CAA gain recognized by the section 901(m) payor or a member of the section 901(m) payor's consolidated group. If the RFA has a negative basis difference, the allocated basis difference adjustment is equal to the greater of the allocated basis difference or the portion of any unallocated CAA loss that corresponds to the CAA loss recognized by the section 901(m) payor or a member of the section 901(m) payor's consolidated group. For purposes of this paragraph, CAA gain or CAA loss recognized by the section 901(m) payor or a member of the section 901(m) payor's consolidated group includes their distributive share of CAA gain or CAA loss recognized by a partnership.
