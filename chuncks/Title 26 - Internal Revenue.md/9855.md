###### ยง 1.168(k)-2 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Property was not used by the taxpayer at any time prior to acquisition,1,In general.,1

(B)-()Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)() of this section, the property is treated as used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to acquisition by the taxpayer or predecessor if the taxpayer or the predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to such acquisition, whether or not the taxpayer or the predecessor claimed depreciation deductions for the property. To determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition, only the five calendar years immediately prior to the current calendar year in which the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, and the portion of such current calendar year before the placed-in-service date of the property without taking into account the applicable convention, are taken into account (lookback period). If either the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, have not been in existence for the entire lookback period, only the portion of the lookback period during which the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, as applicable, have been in existence is taken into account to determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition. If a lessee has a depreciable interest in the improvements made to leased property and subsequently the lessee acquires the leased property of which the improvements are a part, the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in ยง 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the acquired property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the improvements.
