###### ยง 1.901(m)-7 De minimis rules.
####### Rules of application.

(d)The following rules apply for purposes of this section.

(1) Whether a basis difference qualifies for the cumulative basis difference exemption, the RFA class exemption, or the RFA exemption is determined when an asset first becomes an RFA with respect to a CAA. In the case of a subsequent CAA described in ยง 1.901(m)-6(b)(4), the application of the cumulative basis difference exemption, the RFA class exemption, and the RFA exemption is based on basis difference, if any, that results from the subsequent CAA.

(2) If there is an aggregated CAA transaction, the cumulative basis difference exemption and each RFA class exemption are applied by treating all CAAs that are part of the aggregated CAA transaction as a single CAA.

(3) Basis difference is computed in accordance with ยง 1.901(m)-4 except that a foreign basis election need not be evidenced if the cumulative basis difference exemption, an RFA class exemption, or the RFA exemption apply to all RFAs with respect to the CAA.

(4) Basis difference is translated into U.S. dollars (if necessary) using the spot rate determined under the principles of ยง 1.988-1(d) on the date of the CAA.
