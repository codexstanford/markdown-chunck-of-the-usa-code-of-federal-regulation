()The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(B)() of this section, except that, in 2024, P sells just ten percent of its S stock to an unrelated third party at a gain of $2.5x. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(E)() of this section, the lesser of P's gain recognized on the sale of the S stock ($2.5x) and the investment adjustments under ยง 1.1502-32 with respect to the S stock P sold ($3x) is $2.5x, an amount less than the $20x limitation under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(F) of this section. Thus, the P group must subtract $2.5x from its tentative taxable income in computing its ATI for its 2024 taxable year.
