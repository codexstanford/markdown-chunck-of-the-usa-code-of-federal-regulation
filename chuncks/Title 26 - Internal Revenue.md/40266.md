####### ii,Dual use ratio.

()Because the depreciation with respect to Asset E is partly deducted and partly capitalized to inventory, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is determined by reference to the depreciation that is deducted and the depreciation that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, FC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is 80%, which is the ratio calculated as the sum ($20x) of the amount of FC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E that is allocated and apportioned to FC's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) for Year 1 ($8x) and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's tested income for Year 1 ($12x), divided by the sum ($25x) of the total amount of FC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($10x) and the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's income or loss for Year 1 ($15x).
