###### ยง 1.249-1 Limitation on deduction of bond premium on repurchase.
####### One-year's interest rule.

(2)For a convertible obligation repurchased on or after March 2, 1998, a call premium specified in dollars under the terms of the obligation is considered to be a normal call premium on a nonconvertible obligation if the call premium applicable when the obligation is repurchased does not exceed an amount equal to the interest (including original issue discount) that otherwise would be deductible for the taxable year of repurchase (determined as if the obligation were not repurchased). The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the amount of interest payable for the corporation's taxable year is subject under the terms of the obligation to any contingency other than repurchase prior to the close of such taxable year.
