####### Analysis.,Example 4

(B)The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B) of this section () with respect to DS Note A. DS Note B is also issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(6) of this section, DS Note B is treated as funding only the remaining portion of DS's distribution to USS1, which is $200x. Accordingly, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by DS to FP on Date C in Year 2. The remaining $100x of DS Note B continues to be treated as indebtedness.
