###### § 31.3406(g)-3 Exemption while payee is waiting for a taxpayer identification number.
####### In general,Backup withholding not required for 60 days.

(a)-(1)If a payor has received an awaiting-TIN certificate from a payee with respect to an account or instrument receiving reportable interest or dividends as described in section 3406(b)(2), the payor must exempt the payee from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) during the 60-day exemption period to the extent and in the manner described in either paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section. The 60-day exemption period means the 60-consecutive-day period beginning with the day the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certificate. The payor must withhold under section 3406 beginning after the 60-day exemption period if the payor has not received a taxpayer identification number from the payee in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1. Regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to a payor, the payor is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2 on reportable interest or dividend payments as described in § 31.3406(d)-2 if the payee fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting as required in section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2.
