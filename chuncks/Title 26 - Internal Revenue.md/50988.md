####### Identification of territory financial institutions acting as intermediaries or that are flow-through entities.

(ii)A withholding agent may treat a payment as being made to a territory financial institution that is acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity if the withholding agent has an intermediary withholding certificate or flow-through withholding certificate as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section that identifies the person who receives the payment as a territory financial institution. A withholding agent that obtains the documentation described in the preceding sentence may treat the territory financial institution as the payee if the withholding certificate contains a certification that the territory financial institution agrees to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment. If the withholding certificate does not contain such a certification, then the withholding agent must treat the person on whose behalf the territory financial institution receives the payment as the payee. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section for additional documentation that must accompany the withholding certificate of the territory financial institution in this case.
