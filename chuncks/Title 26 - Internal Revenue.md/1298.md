####### In general.

(a)(1) Under section 44(d) except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, if the taxpayer disposes of property, with respect to the purchase of which a credit was allowed under section 44(a), at any time within 36 months after the date on which he acquired it (or, in the case of construction by the taxpayer, the date on which he first occupied it as his principal residence), then the tax imposed under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which the replacement period (as provided under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) terminates is increased by an amount equal to the amount allowed as a credit for the purchase of such property.

(2) The replacement period is the period provided for purchase of a new principal residence under section 1034 of the Code without recognition of gain on the sale of the old residence. In the case of residences sold or exchanged after December 31, 1974, it is generally 18 months in the case of acquisition by purchase and 2 years in the case of construction by the taxpayer provided, however, that such construction has commenced within the 18-month period. Thus, a calendar-year taxpayer who disposes of his old principal residence in December 1975 and does not qualify under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section will include the amount previously allowed as additional tax on his 1977 tax return.

(3) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, section 44(d) applies to all dispositions of property, including sales (including foreclosure sales), exchanges (including tax-free exchanges such as those under sections 351, 721, and 1031), and gifts.

(4) In the case of a husband and wife who were allowed a credit under section 44(a) claimed on a joint return, for the purpose of section 44(d) and this section the credit shall be allocated between the spouses in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of ยง 1.44-1.
