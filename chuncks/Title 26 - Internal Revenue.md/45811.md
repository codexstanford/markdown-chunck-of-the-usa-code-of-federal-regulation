####### Property distributed by a partnership to a partner,General.

(f)-(1)For purposes of section 1250 (d)(3) and (e)(2), the basis of section 1250 property distributed by a partnership to a partner shall be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership. Thus, if section 731 applies to a distribution of section 1250 property by a partnership to a partner, then even though the partner's basis is not determined for other purposes by reference to the partnership's basis, (i) the amount of gain taken into account by the partnership under section 1250(a) is limited by section 1250(d)(3) to the amount of gain recognized to the partnership upon the distribution (determined without regard to section 1250), and (ii) the holding period of the property in the hands of the partner shall, under section 1250(e)(2), include the holding period of the property in the hands of the partnership. For nonapplication of section 1250(d)(3) to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, see paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
