###### ยง 1.482-7 Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a cost sharing arrangement.
####### 2,Use of differential income stream as a consideration in assessing the best method.,Example 8

()An analysis under the income method that uses a different discount rate for the cost sharing alternative than for the licensing alternative will be more reliable the greater the extent to which the implied discount rate for the projected present value of the differential income stream is consistent with reliable direct evidence of the appropriate discount rate applicable for activities reasonably anticipated to generate an income stream with a similar risk profile to the differential income stream. Such differential income stream is defined as the stream of the reasonably anticipated residuals of the PCT Payor's licensing payments to be made under the licensing alternative, minus the PCT Payor's cost contributions to be made under the cost sharing alternative. Seeof paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section.
