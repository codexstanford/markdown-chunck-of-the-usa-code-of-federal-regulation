(3)No item of gross income shall be counted as foreign base company shipping income under more than one provision of this section. For example, If $200 of gross income derived from the use of a lighter is treated as foreign base company shipping income under both paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, then such $200 is counted only once as foreign base company shipping income. A taxpayer may choose under which provision to include an item of income.
