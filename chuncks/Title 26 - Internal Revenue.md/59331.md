####### Portion of stock basis allocable to basis of authority when stock of indirect holder of authority is acquired.

(iv)If the qualified acquiring party acquired the stock of a corporation indirectly holding the authority (such as by owning all of the stock of a subsidiary that directly holds the authority), a portion of the qualified acquiring party's cost basis in the stock of the acquired corporation may be allocated to the basis in the operating authority. The portion allocable is the amount that would have been properly allocable under section 334(b)(2) if, immediately before the liquidation of the acquired corporation on the date of the last acquisition by purchase of stock of the acquired corporation within the 12-month period described in section 334(b)(2)(B), the authority had been transferred in such a way (such as by liquidating the subsidiary that directly holds the authority) that the qualified acquiring party would have received direct ownership of the authority upon the liquidation of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition.
