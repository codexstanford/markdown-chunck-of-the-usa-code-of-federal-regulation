###### Treatment of amounts received through accident or health insurance.

(ii)To the extent that the payment of a premium for accident or health insurance constitutes a distribution under this paragraph (e)(1), amounts received through accident or health insurance are neither paid by the employer nor attributable to contributions by the employer that are excludable from the gross income of the employee. Accordingly, to the extent the premium for accident or health insurance constitutes a distribution under this paragraph (e)(1), amounts received through the accident or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness are excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3) and are not treated as distributions from the plan. If those amounts are paid to the plan instead of to the employee, those amounts are treated as having been paid to the employee and then contributed by the employee to the plan (and must satisfy the qualification requirements applicable to employee contributions).
