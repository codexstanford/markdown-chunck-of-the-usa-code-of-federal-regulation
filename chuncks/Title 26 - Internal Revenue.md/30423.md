Such adjusted basis shall be determined by apportioning the total adjusted basis of the property between the part of the property disposed of and the part retained in the same proportion as the fair market value of each part (as of the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition) bears to the total fair market value of the property as of such date. For determining gain or loss on the sale or exchange of any part of the aggregated or combined property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated or combined property (from which the adjusted basis of the part is determined) shall not be reduced below zero.
