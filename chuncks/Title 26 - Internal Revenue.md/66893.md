(h)Tax does not apply on the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if under the applicable provisions of the Code the sale of the article for a similar use would not be subject to tax. For example, the use of gasoline by the producer thereof to propel tankers engaged in foreign trade which are owned or leased by the producer would not be subject to tax under section 4218 since a sale for such use would be exempt from tax as provided in section 4221(a)(3). Also, tax need not be paid with respect to the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if such use would qualify, under the provisions of section 6416(b), for credit or refund of the tax paid.
