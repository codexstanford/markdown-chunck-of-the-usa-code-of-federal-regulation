###### In General
####### § 301.6226-1 Election for an alternative to the payment of the imputed underpayment.
######## Binding nature of statements.

(e)The election under this section, which includes filing and furnishing statements described in § 301.6226-2, are actions of the partnership under section 6223 and, unless determined otherwise by the IRS, the partner's share of the adjustments and the applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts as set forth in the statement are binding on the partner pursuant to section 6223. Accordingly, a partner may not treat any partnership-related items (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) reflected on a statement described in § 301.6226-2 on the partner's return inconsistently with how those items are treated on the statement that is filed with the IRS. See § 301.6222-1(c)(2) (regarding partnership-related items the treatment of which a partner is bound to under section 6223).
