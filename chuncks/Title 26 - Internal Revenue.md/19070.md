()For purposes of calculating the expanded group earnings of a covered member for a taxable year, expanded group earnings are calculated without regard to the application of this section during the taxable year to a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member that was not treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section as of the close of the preceding taxable year, or, if the covered member is an expanded group partner in a controlled partnership that is the issuer of a debt instrument, without regard to the application of ยง 1.385-3(f)(4)(i) during the taxable year with respect to the covered member's share of the debt instrument. To the extent that the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)() reduces the expanded group earnings of the covered member for the taxable year, the expanded group earnings of the covered member are increased as of the beginning of the succeeding taxable year during the expanded group period.
