A qualified acquiring party is a corporation (or a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) that after June 21, 1952, and on or before July 1, 1980 (or after July 1, 1980 under a binding contract in effect on such date) acquired by purchase, within the meaning of section 334(b)(3) and during a period of not more than 12 months, 80 percent or more of the stock (as described in section 334(b)(2)(B)) of a corporation (the acquired corporation) which held the authority directly or indirectly on the date which is the end of the period of 12 months or less within which such 80 percent of the acquired corporation's stock was purchased. The election to allocate basis in an acquired corporation's stock to the basis in an authority may be made only if 80 percent of all classes of the acquired corporation's stock (other than nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends) was acquired by purchase (within the meaning of section 334(b)(3)) during a period of not more than 12 months, as described in section 334(b)(2)(B). If the qualified acquiring party is a corporation, the taxpayer holding the authority on July 1, 1980, may elect the basis allocation of this paragraph only if it is a member of the affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) of which the qualified acquiring party is a member. If there is more than one acquisition of stock that might permit an election to allocate basis under this paragraph (e)(2)(i), the taxpayer may elect to allocate to the authority only the basis in the acquired corporation's stock held by the qualified acquiring party which became a qualified acquiring party as a result of the last of such acquisitions.
