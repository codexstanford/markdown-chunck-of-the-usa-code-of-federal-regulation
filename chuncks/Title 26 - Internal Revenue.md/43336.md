####### Evidence of fair market value.

(ii)For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the fair market value of imported articles constituting foreign content may be evidenced by the customs invoice issued on the importation of such articles into the United States. If the holder of such articles is not the importer (or a related person with respect to the importer), the fair market value of such articles may be evidenced by a certificate based upon information contained in the customs invoice and furnished to the holder by the person from whom such articles (or property incorporating such articles) were purchased. If a customs invoice or certificate described in the preceding sentence is not available to a person purchasing property, such person shall establish that no more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such property is attributable to the fair market value of articles which were imported into the United States.
