()-For purposes of the preceding paragraph, an entity will be considered to be located in a qualifying population census tract if at least 50 percent of the total gross income of the entity is derived from the active conduct of a qualified business (as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) within one or more qualifying population census tracts (gross income requirement); at least 40 percent of the use of the tangible property of the entity (whether owned or leased) is within one or more qualifying population census tracts (use of tangible property requirement); and at least 40 percent of the services performed for the entity by its employees are performed in one or more qualifying population census tracts (services performed requirement). The entity is deemed to satisfy the gross income requirement if the entity satisfies the use of tangible property requirement or the services performed requirement on the basis of at least 50 percent instead of 40 percent. If the entity has no employees, the entity is deemed to satisfy the services performed requirement and the gross income requirement if at least 85 percent of the use of the tangible property of the entity (whether owned or leased) is within one or more qualifying population census tracts.
