####### Analysis.

(B)The combined assets of X and B for 2020 (averaged under ยง 1.861-9T(g)(3)) consist 60% ($6,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating domestic source income, 30% ($3,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating foreign source foreign branch category income, and 10% ($1,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating foreign source general category income. The combined interest expense of X and B is $300x. Thus, $180x ($300x x 60%) of the combined interest expense is apportioned to domestic source income, $90x ($300x x 30%) is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income, and $30x ($300x x 10%) is apportioned to foreign source general category income, yielding net U.S. source income of $820 ($1,000x-$180x), net foreign source foreign branch category income of $410 ($500x-$90x), and net foreign source general category income of $470x ($500x-$30x).
