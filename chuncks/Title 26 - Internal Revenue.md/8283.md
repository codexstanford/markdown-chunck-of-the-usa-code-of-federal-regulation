####### Partner-level computations.

(iv)In computing its limit under section 163(j), each partner has $0 of ATI and $10 of business interest expense. Each partner's section 163(j) limit is $0 ($0 x 30 percent). Thus, each partner's $10 of business interest expense is not allowed as a deduction and is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued by the partner in 2020. X, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $25 of ATI and $30 of business interest expense. X's section 163(j) limit is $7.50 ($25 x 30 percent). Thus, X has $7.50 of deductible business interest expense. X's $22.50 of business interest expense not allowed as a deduction is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued by X in 2020. Y and Z, in computing their respective limits under section 163(j), each have $0 of ATI and $10 of business interest expense. Thus, Y and Z each have $10 of business interest expense not allowed as a deduction that is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued in 2020.
