###### Indirect transactions by a private foundation.

(b)A transaction engaged in directly with a Government official by an organization described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) which is the recipient of a grant from a private foundation shall not constitute an indirect act of self-dealing between such private foundation and Government official if the private foundation does not earmark the use of the grant for any named Government official and does not control or retain any veto power over the selection of the Government official by the grantee organization. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a grant by a private foundation shall not constitute an indirect act of self-dealing even though such foundation had reason to believe that certain Government officials would derive benefits from such grant so long as the grantee, in fact, exercises control over the selecting process and actually makes the selection completely independent of the private foundation.
