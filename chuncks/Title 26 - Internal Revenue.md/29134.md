###### ยง 1.513-7 Travel and tour activities of tax exempt organizations.

(a) Travel tour activities that constitute a trade or business, as defined in ยง 1.513-1(b), and that are not substantially related to the purposes for which exemption has been granted to the organization constitute an unrelated trade or business with respect to that organization. Whether travel tour activities conducted by an organization are substantially related to the organization's exempt purpose is determined by looking at all relevant facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, how a travel tour is developed, promoted and operated. Section 513(c) and ยง 1.513-1(b) also apply to travel tour activity. Application of the rules of section 513(c) and ยง 1.513-1(b) may result in different treatment for individual tours within an organization's travel tour program.
