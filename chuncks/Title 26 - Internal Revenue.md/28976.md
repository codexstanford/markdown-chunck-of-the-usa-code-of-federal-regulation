###### ยง 1.512(a)-6 Special rule for organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business.
####### Combining related interests.

(ii)When determining an organization's percentage interest in a partnership for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the interests of a supporting organization (as defined in section 509(a)(3) and ยง 1.509(a)-4), other than a Type III supporting organization (as defined in ยง 1.509(a)-4(i)) that is not a parent of its supported organization, or of a controlled entity (as defined in section 512(b)(13)(D) and ยง 1.512(b)-1(l)) in the same partnership will be taken into account. For example, if an organization owns 10 percent of the capital interests in a partnership, and its Type I supporting organization owns an additional 15 percent capital interest in that partnership, the organization would not meet the requirements of the participation test because its aggregate percentage interest exceeds 20 percent (10 percent + 15 percent = 25 percent).
