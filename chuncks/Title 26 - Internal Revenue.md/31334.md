####### In general.

(a)If the separate share rule of section 663(c) is applicable for any taxable year of a trust, subpart D is applied as if each share were a separate trust except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and in ยง 1.668(a)-1A(c). Thus, the amounts of an "accumulation distribution", "undistributed net income", "undistributed capital gain", and "capital gain distribution" are computed separately for each share.
