####### Purchase price,General rule.

(b)-(1)For purposes of section 44(a) and ยง 1.44-1, the term "purchase price" means the adjusted basis of the new principal residence on the date of acquisition and includes all amounts attributable to the acquisition or construction, but only to the extent that such amounts constitute capital expenditures and are not allowable as deductions in computing taxable income. Such capital expenditures include but are not limited to the cost of acquisition or construction, title insurance, attorney's fees, transfer taxes, and other costs of transfer. For these purposes the adjusted basis of a factory-made home includes the cost of moving the home and setting it up as the taxpayer's principal residence only where such cost is included in the base price of the residence; it also includes the purchase price of the land on which the home is located, but only if such land was purchased by the taxpayer after March 12, 1975 and only if the taxpayer acquired the land prior to or in conjunction with the acquisition of such factory-made home. However, the adjusted basis does not include any expenditures involved in connection with the leasing of land on which the factory-made home is located. In the case of factory-made homes the adjusted basis includes furniture only where it is included in the base price of the unit.
