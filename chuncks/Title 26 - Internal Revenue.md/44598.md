####### PRS's Capital Interest Allocation Analysis.

(B)Because PRS's partnership agreement provides for no differences as to the amount and timing of capital contributed, the rate of return on capital contributed, the type and level of risk associated with capital contributed, or the rights to cash or property distributions during the PRS's operations and on liquidation, the allocations and distribution rights with respect the capital contributed by GP are reasonably consistent with the allocation and distribution rights with respect to capital contributed by Unrelated Non-Service Partners. Accordingly, GP's allocation of $160 is a Capital Interest Allocation that is treated as made in a similar manner as the allocations made to the Unrelated Non-Service Partners.
