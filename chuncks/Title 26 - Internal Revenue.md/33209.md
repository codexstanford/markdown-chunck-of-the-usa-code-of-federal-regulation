###### ยง 1.801-4 Life insurance reserves.
####### Certain reserves which need not be required by law.

(b)Section 801(b)(2) sets forth certain reserves which, though not required by law, may still qualify as life insurance reserves, provided, however, that they first satisfy the requirements of section 801(b)(1) (A) and (B) and paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section. Thus, reserves need not be required by law:

(1) In the case of policies covering life, health, and accident insurance combined in one policy issued on the weekly premium payment plan, continuing for life and not subject to cancellation, and

(2) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, in the case of policies issued by an organization which met the requirements of section 501(c)(9) (as it existed prior to amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1969) other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof.
