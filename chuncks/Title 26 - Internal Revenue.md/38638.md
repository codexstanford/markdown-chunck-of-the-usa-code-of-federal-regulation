####### Safe harbor.

(B)In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, for the post-2017 taxable year in which a net operating loss carryforward described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is used, the taxpayer may choose to treat the net operating loss carryforward as attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate categories for general category income and foreign branch category income to the extent of any general category income and foreign branch category income, respectively, that is available in the carryforward year to be offset by the net operating loss carryforward. To the extent the net operating loss carryforward offsets any other income in the carryforward year, it is treated as attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income. If the sum of taxpayer's general category income and foreign branch income in the carryforward year exceeds the amount of the net operating loss carryforward, then the amount of each type of separate income that is offset by the net operating loss carryforward, and therefore the separate category treatment of the net operating loss carryforward, is be determined on a proportionate basis. A general category net operating loss to which the exception is applied is absorbed before any general category net operating loss that is incurred after the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018.
