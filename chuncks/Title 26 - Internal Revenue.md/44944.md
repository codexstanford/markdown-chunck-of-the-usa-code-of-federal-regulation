####### Transitional rule for net long-term capital losses sustained in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.,pre-1970 taxable year,post-1969 taxable year,transitional net long-term capital loss component

(4)In the case of a net long-term capital loss sustained by a taxpayer other than a corporation in a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1970 (referred to in this section as a) which is carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969 (referred to in this section as a), the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for the taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1211(b) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and § 1.1211-1(b)(3), and the amount of such long-term capital loss carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1212(b)(1) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (instead of under sections 1211(b) and 1212(b)(1) as in effect for post-1969 taxable years and § 1.1211-1(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, respectively) but only to the extent that such pre-1970 long-term capital loss constitutes a(determined as provided in § 1.1211-1(b)(3)(ii)) in the taxable year to which such pre-1970 long-term capital loss is carried. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (2) of this section, to the extent that a component of the transitional additional allowance deductible for a post-1969 taxable year under section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b)(3)(i) is a transitional net long-term capital loss component carried over to such post-1969 taxable year, such component shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in determining the amount and character of capital loss carryovers from such post-1969 taxable year to the succeeding taxable year. Such component shall be so treated as a short-term capital gain in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis and shall not be doubled for this purpose as is provided by subdivision (ii) of paragraph (2) of this section in the case of a component of the additional allowance made up of net long-term capital losses applied pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1211-1(b)(2)(iii). The transitional rule provided in this paragraph does not apply to a determination of the character of capital losses (as long-term or short-term) actually deductible for the current taxable year under section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b).
