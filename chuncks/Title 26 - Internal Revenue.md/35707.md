(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (the facts in), except that B also has an office in a foreign country that is a material factor in the realization of income from the sales made through B's U.S. office. No income from the sale of merchandise is allocable to B's U.S. sales office for the taxable year, by reason of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and thus none of the $300,000x is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of B's U.S. trade or business.
