####### Example 5: Disregarded payment for depreciable non-inventory property,Facts.,Example 4

(v)-(A)The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section (the facts in), except as set forth in this paragraph (f)(4)(v)(A). Asset A is depreciable property. In Year 2, P is entitled to a $20x depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A, $18x of which is allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and $2x of which is allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. If the transfer of Asset A were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, FDE would be entitled to a $50x depreciation deduction, 90% of which would be allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 10% of which would be allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. In Year 2, FDE earns $315x of gross income that it reflects on its books and records that, in the absence of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, would be foreign branch category income. FDE also earns $35x of passive category income in Year 2 from the non-active rental of a portion of Asset A. In Year 3, FDE reflects $420x of gross income on its separate set of books and records by reason of the sale of Asset A (that is, $600x amount realized less Asset A's $180x adjusted basis), $42x of which is passive category income under paragraph (b) of this section.
