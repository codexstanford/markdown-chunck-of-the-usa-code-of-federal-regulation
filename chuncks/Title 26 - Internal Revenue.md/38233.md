####### Example 12: Application of intangible property rules,Facts.

(xii)-(A)P, a domestic corporation that has a calendar taxable year, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Asset A, a patent with a useful life ending on December 31, Year 2, was obtained with respect to a discovery that was made by FDE in the course of its trade or business and was used in that trade or business until December 31, Year 1. On December 31, Year 1, FDE remits Asset A to P and receives no consideration. Asset A has an adjusted basis of $0. In Year 2, P uses Asset A to generate general category gross income. P earns $1,000x of general category U.S. source gross income in Year 2, including the income generated by its use of Asset A. If FDE were a domestic corporation, P were a foreign corporation, and Asset A had been transferred in exchange for stock in a transaction described in section 351, such that section 367(d) applied by its terms (but all other facts remained the same), the payment determined under section 367(d) for Year 2 would be $300x. A disregarded payment for the use of Asset A, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE's $1,000x of general category U.S. source gross income under ยง 1.861-8.
