###### § 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### Coordination with other limitations.

(v)This paragraph (c)(2) does not allow a net operating loss to offset income to the extent inconsistent with other limitations or restrictions on the use of losses, such as a limitation based on the nature or activities of members. For example, a net operating loss may not offset income in excess of any limitations under section 172(a) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Additionally, any dual consolidated loss may not reduce the taxable income to an extent greater than that allowed under section 1503(d) and §§ 1.1503(d)-1 through 1.1503(d)-8. See also § 1.1502-47(k) (relating to preemption of rules for life-nonlife groups).
