####### 2,Analysis,i,Tentative gross tested income items.,1,2,2

()-()Under paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, the tentative gross tested income item with respect to each of the CFC1X tested unit and the FDE1Y tested unit is the aggregate of the gross income of CFC1X that is attributable to the tested unit, that would be gross tested income (without regard to this paragraph (c)(7)), and that would be in a single tested income group. Under paragraphs (c)(7)(ii)(B)() and () of this section, items of gross income of CFC1X are attributable to the CFC1X tested unit, or the FDE1Y tested unit, to the extent properly reflected on its separate set of books and records, as determined under federal income tax principles and adjusted to take into account disregarded payments. Without regard to the €20x disregarded interest payment from FDE1Y to CFC1X, gross income attributable to the CFC1X tested unit would be €0 (that is, the €20x of interest income reflected on the books and records of CFC1X would be reduced by €20x, the amount attributable to the payment that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes). Similarly, without regard to the €20x disregarded interest payment from FDE1Y to CFC1X, gross income attributable to the FDE1Y tested unit would be €100x (that is, €100x of services income reflected on the books and records of FDE1Y, unreduced by the €20x disregarded interest payment from FDE1Y to CFC1X). However, under paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)() of this section, the gross income attributable to each of the CFC1X tested unit and the FDE1Y tested unit is adjusted by €20x, the amount of the disregarded interest payment from FDE1Y to CFC1X that is deductible for Country Y tax purposes. Accordingly, the tentative gross tested income item attributable to the CFC1X tested unit (the "CFC1X tentative gross tested income item") is €20x (€0 + €20x), and the tentative gross tested income item attributable to the FDE1Y tested unit (the "FDE1Y tentative gross tested income item") is €80x (€100x - €20x).
