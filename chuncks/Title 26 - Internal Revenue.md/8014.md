###### ยง 1.163(j)-2 Deduction for business interest expense limited.
####### Partnership-level analysis.

(ii)For the 2021 taxable year, PRS allocates the $10x of excess business interest expense equally to X and Y ($5x each). See ยง 1.163(j)-6(f)(2). For the 2022 taxable year, section 163(j) does not apply to PRS because PRS qualifies for the small business exemption. As a result, none of PRS's $40x of business interest expense for the 2022 taxable year is subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the partnership level.
