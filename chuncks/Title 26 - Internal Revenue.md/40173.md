()Country X imposes no tax on net income, and Country Y imposes a 25% tax on net income. For Country Y tax purposes, FDE1Y (which is not disregarded under Country Y tax law) has €80x of taxable income (€100x of services income from the unrelated parties, less a €20x deduction for the interest paid to CFC1X). Accordingly, FDE1Y incurs a Country Y income tax liability with respect to Year 1 of €20x (€80x x 25%), the U.S. dollar amount of which is $20x.
