###### Corrective distributions for plan years beginning before January 1, 2008.

(B)The tax treatment of corrective distributions for plan years beginning before January 1, 2008, is determined under ยง 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(vi) (as it appeared in the April 1, 2007, edition of 26 CFR Part 1). If the total amount of excess aggregate contributions determined under this paragraph (b)(2), and excess contributions determined under ยง 1.401(k)-2(b)(2) distributed to a recipient under a plan for any plan year is less than $100 (excluding income), a corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income) is includible in gross income in the recipient's taxable year in which the corrective distribution is made, except to the extent the corrective distribution is a return of employee contributions, or as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(C) of this section.
