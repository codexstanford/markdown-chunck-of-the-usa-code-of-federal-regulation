###### Passenger.

(f)For purposes of sections 4471 and 4472, "passenger" means an individual carried on the vessel except-

(1) The Master; or

(2) A crew member or other individual engaged in the business of the vessel or its owners. A person is engaged in the business of the vessel or its owners if the person is an employee of the vessel or her owners or has a duty, contractual or otherwise, to perform on the vessel on behalf of the vessel or its owners. For example, a person engaged as an entertainer, instructor, or lecturer for the benefit of the passengers is not a passenger, but a person on a promotional trip such as a travel agent or contest winner is a passenger even though the vessel or its owners may derive some future benefit from the promotion.
