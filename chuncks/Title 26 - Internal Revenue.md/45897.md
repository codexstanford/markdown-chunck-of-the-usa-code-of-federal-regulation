####### Relationship to section 1245.

(5)If property is disposed of which qualifies as both section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) as well as farm recapture property, then gain shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) only to the extent that the amount of any gain realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), or to the extent that the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis (in the case of any other disposition), was not recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property (i) is taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.1251-3 for purposes of computing farm net loss (or farm net income) and (ii) is not under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of ยง 1.1251-2 subtracted from the excess deductions account.
