####### Example 5: Specified interest expense and tested loss QBAI amount,Facts.

(5)-(i)D Corp, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of a single class of stock of each of FS1 and FS2, each a controlled foreign corporation. For Year 1, FS1 is a tested income CFC and FS2 is a tested loss CFC. D Corp, FS1, and FS2 all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In Year 1, FS1 pays $100x of interest to FS2. The interest expense of FS1 is allocated and apportioned to its gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3). The interest income of FS2 is excluded from its foreign personal holding company income by reason of section 954(c)(6). Also, in Year 1, FS2 pays $100x of interest to a bank that is not related to FS2, which interest expense is allocated and apportioned to FS2's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3). Neither FS1 nor FS2 holds qualified assets or owns stock of another controlled foreign corporation. Because FS2 is a tested loss CFC, FS2 has no QBAI. See ยง 1.951A-3(b). However, if FS2 were a tested income CFC, FS2 would have QBAI of $1,000x.
