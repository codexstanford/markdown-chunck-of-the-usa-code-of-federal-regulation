() After deduction of T's $48 SRLY NOL in 2022, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 x 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($60-$60).
