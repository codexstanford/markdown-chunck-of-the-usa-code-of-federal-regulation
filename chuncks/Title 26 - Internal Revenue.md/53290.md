###### ยง 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Example 3.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, except that, for 2022, the nonlife consolidated net operating loss is $150. This entire amount is attributable to S; thus, it is eligible to be carried back to 2021 against nonlife consolidated taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and ยง 1.1502-21(b). If P, the agent for the group within the meaning of ยง 1.1502-77, does not elect to relinquish the carryback under section 172(b)(3), the entire $150 will be carried back, reducing 2021 nonlife consolidated taxable income to zero and nonlife consolidated capital gain net income to zero. Under paragraph (h)(3)(xii) of this section, the setoff in 2021 of the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income ($50) by the life consolidated net capital loss ($50) is restored. Accordingly, the 2021 life consolidated net capital loss may be carried over by the life subgroup to 2022. Under paragraph (e) of this section, after the carryback, consolidated taxable income for 2021 is $200 (nonlife consolidated taxable income ($0) plus consolidated LICTI ($200)).
