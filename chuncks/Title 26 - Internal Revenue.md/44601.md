####### Analysis.

(B)GP does not have a capital interest in PRS. Therefore, its allocations from PRS are allocations with respect to its API which are subject to section 1061. The total gain allocable to A as a result of the hypothetical liquidations would be $700. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, $100 of the $700 of A's interest sale gain is A's Capital Interest Disposition Amount, and is not subject to section 1061.
