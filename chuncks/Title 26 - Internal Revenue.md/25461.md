####### Treatment of estimated future costs in year of completion.

(ii)If a taxpayer reasonably expects to incur additional allocable contract costs in a tax year subsequent to the year in which the contract is completed, the taxpayer includes the actual costs incurred as of the end of the completion year plus the additional allocable contract costs that are reasonably expected to be incurred (to the extent includible under the taxpayer's percentage of completion method) in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio. The completion year is the only filing year for which the taxpayer may include additional estimated costs in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio in applying the look-back method. If the look-back method is reapplied in any year after the completion year, only the cumulative costs incurred as of the end of the year of reapplication are includible in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio in reapplying the look-back method.
