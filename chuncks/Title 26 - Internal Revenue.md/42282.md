####### Other community income.

(3)All community income for any taxable year to which this paragraph applies, other than income described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, shall be treated as the income of the spouse who, for such taxable year, has a greater amount of gross income than the other spouse, determined by adding to the amount of gross income which is treated as the gross income of that spouse in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the amount of the gross income for the taxable year which is treated as the separate income of that spouse under the community property laws of the foreign country having jurisdiction to determine the legal ownership of the income. If either spouse dies during a taxable year, the taxable year of the surviving spouse shall be treated as ending on the date of such death for the purpose of determining which spouse has the greater amount of gross income for such taxable year. Moreover, if the U.S. citizen and his nonresident alien spouse do not have the same taxable year, as defined in section 441(b) and the regulations thereunder, the periods for which the amounts of gross income are to be compared under this subparagraph are (i) the taxable year of the citizen and (ii) that period falling within the consecutive taxable years of the nonresident alien spouse which coincides with the period covered by such taxable year of the citizen. See paragraph (c) of ยง 1.981-3.
