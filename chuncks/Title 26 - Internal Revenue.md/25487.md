####### Closely held.

(B)A pass-through entity is closely held if, at any time during any redetermination year, 50 percent of more (by value) of the beneficial interests in that entity are held (directly or indirectly) by or for 5 or fewer persons. For this purpose, the term "person" has the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(1), except that a pass-through entity is not treated as a person. In addition, the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) apply by substituting the term "beneficial interest" for the term "stock" and by substituting the term "pass-through entity" for the term, "corporation" used in that section, as appropriate, for purposes of determining whether a beneficial interest in a pass-through entity is indirectly owned by any person.
