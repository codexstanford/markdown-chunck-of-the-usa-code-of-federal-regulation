####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a significant purpose of Corporation E's activities is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. The gold bar business carried out by Corporation E was merely speculative in nature and was not expected to increase economic activity in the subject qualified opportunity zone in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. As a result, Corporation E's activities are carried on to achieve tax results that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Consequently, the gold bars are not qualified opportunity zone property. Corporation E fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business unless other assets that it owns or leases are qualified opportunity zone business property that satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) (along with other requirements). If Corporation E fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business, Corporation E's stock fails to be qualified opportunity zone property in the hands of Entity E.
