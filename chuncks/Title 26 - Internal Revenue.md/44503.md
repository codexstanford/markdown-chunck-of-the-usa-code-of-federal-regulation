####### Insurance business.

(5)If the trade or business transferred is an insurance business, the rules of this paragraph (c) are modified by the principles of ยง 1.338-11(a) through (d). However, in transactions governed by section 1060, such principles apply even if the transfer of the trade or business is effected in whole or in part through indemnity reinsurance rather than assumption reinsurance, and, for the insurer or reinsurer, an insurance contract (including an annuity or reinsurance contract) is a Class VI asset regardless of whether it is a section 197 intangible. In addition, the principles of ยง 1.338-11(f) through (h) apply if the transfer occurs in connection with the complete liquidation of the transferor.
