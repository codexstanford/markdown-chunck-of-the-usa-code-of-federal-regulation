###### ยง 1.1472-1 Withholding on NFFEs.
####### Rules for determining payee and beneficial owner,In general.

(d)-(1)For purposes of this section, except in the case of a payee that is a QI, WP, or WT, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by the payee as determined under ยง 1.1471-3. Thus, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by an excepted NFFE (other than a QI, WP, or WT) if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation to determine the payee's status as an excepted NFFE under the rules of ยง 1.1471-3(d).
