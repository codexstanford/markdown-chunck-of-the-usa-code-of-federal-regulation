####### Valuation of non-exempt-use assets.

(8)For purposes of determining its distributable amount for a taxable year, a supporting organization determines its minimum asset amount, as defined in paragraph (i)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, by determining the aggregate fair market value of all of its non-exempt-use assets in the immediately preceding taxable year. For these purposes, the determination of the aggregate fair market value of all non-exempt-use assets shall be made using the valuation methods described in ยง 53.4942(a)-2(c) of this chapter. The aggregate fair market value of the supporting organization's non-exempt-use assets shall not be reduced by any amount that is set aside under paragraph (i)(6)(v) of this section. For these purposes, the non-exempt use assets of the supporting organization are all assets of the supporting organization other than-

(i) Assets described in ยง 53.4942(a)-2(c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this chapter (with the term "supporting organization" being substituted for "foundation" or "private foundation" and the date "August 17, 2006" being substituted for "December 31, 1969"); and

(ii) Exempt-use assets, which are assets that are used (or held for use) directly in carrying out the exempt purposes of the supporting organization's supported organization(s) (determined by applying the principles described in ยง 53.4942(a)-2(c)(3) of this chapter) by either-

(A) The supporting organization; or

(B) One or more supported organizations, but only if the supporting organization makes the asset available to the supported organization(s) at no cost (or nominal rent) to the supported organization(s).
