(iv)Under section 301(d)(3) of the 1975 TRA, allocations must be based on the proportion that each participant's compensation bears to all participants' compensation. Compensation in excess of $100,000 must be disregarded in making these allocations. A plan may have a lower stated ceiling on compensation (from $0 to $100,000) and if the plan has such a lower ceiling, compensation in excess of this ceiling must likewise be disregarded. Also, allocations must be based on a participant's compensation while actually employed, not just while actually participating, in the plan year.
