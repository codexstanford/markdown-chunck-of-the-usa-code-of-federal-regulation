####### Analysis.

(B)For Federal income tax purposes, under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, for a payment to qualify as an advance payment, a portion of the payment must be taken into account as AFS revenue for a subsequent taxable year. Under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the amount of the payment included in AFS revenue for a subsequent taxable year is $0, calculated as the $6,000 payment reduced by $6,000 that is treated as taken into account as AFS revenue for 2021 ($3,600 of AFS revenue for 2021 + $2,400 of anticipated chargebacks (section 461 liabilities) which had reduced AFS revenue for 2021). Because no portion of the $6,000 is taken into account as AFS revenue in a subsequent taxable year (that is, on an AFS after 2021), the $6,000 payment received in 2021 is not an advance payment under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
