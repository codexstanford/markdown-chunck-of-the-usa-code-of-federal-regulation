The 1percent penalty must be paid to the United States no later than 90 days after the end of the spending period to which it relates. The 1percent penalty continues to apply at the end of each spending period and each semiannual period thereafter until the earliest of the following-

(i) The termination of the penalty under paragraph (l) of this section;

(ii) The expenditure of all of the available construction proceeds; or

(iii) The last stated final maturity date of bonds that are part of the issue and any bonds that refund those bonds.
