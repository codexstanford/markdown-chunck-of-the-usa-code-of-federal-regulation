####### Analysis.,Example 1

(B)The analysis and results are the same as in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section (the analysis in), except that actual depreciation is $8x ($40x/5) per year and the ceiling rule shortfall under ยง 1.704-3(b)(1) of $2x per year is corrected with a curative allocation of income from DC to FC of $2x per year. Solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each year FC is allocated $12x of total operating income and DC is allocated $8x of operating income. Both the actual depreciation deduction to DC and the curative allocation of income from DC are base erosion tax benefits to DC under paragraphs (c)(5)(v) and (d)(1) of this section.
