####### Analysis.

(ii)The sale by DC to FC is a related party sale. Because FC uses the machine to make product A, but the machine is not a constituent part of product A because FC does not undertake further manufacturing with respect to the machine itself, FC's sale of product A is an unrelated party transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Therefore, DC's sale of the machine is only a FDDEI sale if the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. Because 75 percent of the revenue from future sales of product A will be from unrelated party transactions that would be described in ยง 1.250(b)-4(b), 75 percent of the revenues from DC's sale of the machine to FC constitute FDDEI sales.
