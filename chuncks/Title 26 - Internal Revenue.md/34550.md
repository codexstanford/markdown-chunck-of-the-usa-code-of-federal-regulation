####### iii,Analysis-apportionment.,1

()Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the reserve deduction is ratably apportioned between the statutory grouping (foreign source general category income) and the residual grouping (U.S. source income) on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each grouping. For purposes of apportioning deductions under ยง 1.861-8T(d)(2)(i)(B), exempt income is not taken into account. Under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A)() of this section, in the case of an insurance company taxable under section 801, exempt income includes tax-exempt interest without regard to any reduction for the policyholder's share. U.S.C. has U.S. source income of $200x of which $100x is tax-exempt without regard to the reduction for the policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest that reduces the closing balance of items described in section 807(c). Thus, the gross income taken into account in apportioning U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is $100x of foreign source general category gross income and $100x of U.S. source gross income. Of U.S.C.'s $100x reserve deduction, $50x ($100 x $100x;/$200x) is apportioned to foreign source general category gross income and $50x ($100x x $100x/$200x) is apportioned to U.S. source gross income.
