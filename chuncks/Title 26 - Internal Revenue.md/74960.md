######## Example 2.

(ii)Corporation T fails to file timely 6,000 Forms 1099-MISC for the 1990 calendar year. T files the 6000 Forms 1099-MISC on September 1, 1991. Because T does not correct the failure by August 1, 1991, T is subject to a penalty of $250,000, the maximum penalty under paragraph (a) of this section. Without the limitation of paragraph (a), T would be subject to a $300,000 penalty ($50 x 6,000 = $300,000).
