####### Determination of non-foreign status by withholding agent.,3

(e)A withholding agent may rely on a certification of non-foreign status pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii) to determine whether an interest holder is not a foreign person. Reliance on these documents will excuse the withholding agent from liability imposed under section 1445(e)(1) in the absence of actual knowledge that the interest holder is a foreign person. A withholding agent may also employ other means to determine the status of an interest holder, but, if the agent relies on such other means and the interest holder proves, in fact, to be a foreign person (or, is not a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and therefore is not treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of withholding under section 1445), then the withholding agent is subject to any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder for failure to withhold. See also § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii)(B)() for the period during which a withholding agent may rely on a certification of non-foreign status submitted by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)), which applies under this paragraph (e).
