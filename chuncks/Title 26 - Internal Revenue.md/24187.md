() Guaranteed payments defined in section 707(c) that are deducted in determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section and are not otherwise included in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of partnership items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section, deductions and losses are treated as negative income. Thus, for example, if under section 702(a) a partnership has $1,000 of ordinary taxable income, $500 of specially allocated deductions, and $300 of capital loss, the partnership's aggregate amount of partnership items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section is $200 ($1,000-$500-$300).
