(ii)This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when a section 901(m) payor, or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor, is the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) and, therefore, all of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor is paid or accrued by, or considered paid by, the section 901(m) payor. Thus, this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes and a section 901(m) payor either directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) or directly owns an interest in another fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss recognized by the RFA owner (foreign) for foreign income tax purposes that is (or will be) included in the foreign payor's distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign), and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss.
