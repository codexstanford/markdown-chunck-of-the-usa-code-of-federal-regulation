#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses
###### ยง 1.1251-1 General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of property used in farming where farm losses offset nonfarm income.
####### Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1251(c)(1).

(3)For treatment of gain not recognized under section 1251(c)(1), the principles of paragraph (f) ยง 1.1251-6 shall be applicable. Thus section 1251 does not prevent gain which is not recognized under section 1251 from being considered as gain under another provision of the Code, such as for example, section 1252(a)(1) (relating to treatment of gain from disposition of farm land). See example (1) of paragraph (e) of ยง 1.1252-1.
