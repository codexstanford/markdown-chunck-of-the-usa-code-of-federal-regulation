####### Example 9. Complete liquidation of transferred corporation into transferee foreign corporation,Facts.

(ix)-(A)UST does not make an election under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section in connection with the gain recognition agreement entered into with respect to the initial transfer. In year 3, TFD distributes all of its assets to TFC pursuant to a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply. Under paragraph (k)(8) of this section, UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer such that the liquidation is not a triggering event. Under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the new gain recognition agreement is subject to the conditions and requirements of this section to the same extent as the existing gain recognition agreement, except that the transferred stock is no longer subject to the gain recognition agreement because the transferred stock is cancelled by reason of the liquidation. In year 5 TFC disposes of substantially all of the assets received from TFD in the year 3 liquidation.
