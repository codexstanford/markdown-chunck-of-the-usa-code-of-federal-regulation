######## Partnership pays the imputed underpayment.

(2)An imputed underpayment (determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and included in a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) under section 6231(a)(3)) must be paid by the partnership in the same manner as if the imputed underpayment were a tax imposed for the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6232-1. The FPA will include the amount of any imputed underpayment, as modified under § 301.6225-2 if applicable, unless the partnership waives its right to such FPA under section 6232(d)(2). See § 301.6232-1(d)(2). For the alternative to payment of the imputed underpayment by the partnership, see § 301.6226-1. If a partnership pays an imputed underpayment, the partnership's expenditure for the imputed underpayment is taken into account by the partnership in accordance with § 301.6241-4. For interest and penalties with respect to an imputed underpayment, see section 6233.
