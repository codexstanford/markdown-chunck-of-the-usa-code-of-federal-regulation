####### Special rule for recapture under section 47.

(g)Under section 48(p)(5), if a structure which qualifies for the credit under this section becomes ineligible because it ceases to be held for the specific use by reason of which it qualified (or it is used for other than that qualifying use) before the end of the applicable estimated useful life or period specified in section 47(a), then the investment credit previously allowed with respect to the structure may be partially or entirely recaptured under section 47. Unlike other property to which section 47 applies, single purpose structures may not be converted from one permissible use to another without recapture. See subparagraph (e)(2) of this section.
