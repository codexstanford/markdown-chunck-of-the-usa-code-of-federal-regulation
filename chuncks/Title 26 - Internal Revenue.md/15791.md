###### ยง 1.281-2 Effect of section 281 upon the computation of taxable income.
####### Deduction not disallowed.

(2)In the computation of the taxable income of a terminal railroad corporation, a deduction relating to a "reduced amount", described in paragraph (c) of this section, which is otherwise allowable to it under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to sec. 277) shall not be disallowed by reason of section 281. Thus, deductions for expenses attributable to services rendered to a shareholder are not to be disallowed to a terminal railroad corporation merely because, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge which would be made to any railroad corporation for related terminal services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any liability payable by any railroad corporation with respect to related terminal services is discharged. To the extent that section 281 applies to a deduction relating to a "reduced amount", such deduction shall not be disallowed under section 277.
