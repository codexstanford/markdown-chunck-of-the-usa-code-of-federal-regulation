####### Trusts with unrelated business income.

(5)Every fiduciary for a trust described in section 511(b)(2) which is subject to the tax imposed on its unrelated business taxable income by section 511(b)(1) shall make a return on Form 990-T for each taxable year if the trust has gross income, included in computing unrelated business taxable income for such taxable year, of $1,000 or more. The filing of a return of unrelated business income does not relieve the fiduciary of such trust from the duty of filing other required returns.
