()FS is a tested loss CFC for Year 5. Before taking into account the tested loss in Year 5, FS had sufficient earnings and profits to satisfy the accrued but unpaid dividends of $36x. The amount of the reduction in earnings below the amount necessary to satisfy the accrued but unpaid dividends attributable to the tested loss is $16x ($36x - ($120x - $100x)). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, $16x of the tested loss is allocated to Individual A's preferred stock in the hypothetical distribution described in section 951(a)(2)(A) and ยง 1.951-1(b)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(i), and $84x ($100x - $16x) of the tested loss is allocated to P Corp's common shares in the hypothetical distribution.
