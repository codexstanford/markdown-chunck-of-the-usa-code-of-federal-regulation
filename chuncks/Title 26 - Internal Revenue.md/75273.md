(b)The provisions of section 7425, as added by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, are effective with respect to sales described in section 7425 occurring after November 2, 1966. The notice of sale provisions of section 7425 (c) (1) or (3) do not apply to sales occurring after Nobember 2, 1966, if the seller of the property performed an act before November 3, 1966, which act at the time of performance was required and effective under local law with respect to the sale.

With respect to a notice of sale required under section 7425 (c) (1) or (3)-
