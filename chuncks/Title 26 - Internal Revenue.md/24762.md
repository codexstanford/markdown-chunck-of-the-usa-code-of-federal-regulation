####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A's contract with the customer has three performance obligations, and each performance obligation yields a corresponding item of gross income that is accounted for separately. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A is required to allocate the $108x transaction price amount to each corresponding item of gross income in accordance with the transaction price amount allocated to each respective performance obligation for AFS purposes. Accordingly, A initially allocates $60x to the software license item, $40x to the installation service item, and $8 to the technical support item. However, because the transaction price amount was reduced by the anticipated refund of $2x, which relates specifically to the technical support item, A must increase the transaction price allocable to that item of gross income pursuant to the specific identification approach in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the amount allocated to the item of gross income related to technical support is $10x.
