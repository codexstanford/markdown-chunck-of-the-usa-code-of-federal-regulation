###### ESOP.

(i)The term "ESOP" refers to an employee stock ownership plan that meets the requirements of section 4975(e)(7) and ยง 54.4975-11. It is not synonymous with "stock bonus plan." A stock bonus plan must, however, be an ESOP to engage in an exempt loan. The qualification of an ESOP under section 401(a) and ยง 54.4975-11 will not be adversely affected merely because it engages in a non-exempt loan.
