####### iii,Partner adjusted basis.

()Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset E, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is $240x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E for Year 1 ($300x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E for Year 1 (80 percent).
