###### ยง 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### 4

() Under ยง 1.1502-15(a), the $52 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation is treated as a $52 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is subject to the SRLY limitation because, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Year 3 is treated as a SRLY. The built-in loss is carried to other years in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals $40 (zero from Year 3 + $40). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 4 is $32 ($40 x 80 percent). Therefore, under paragraph (c) of this section, $32 of T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 4.
