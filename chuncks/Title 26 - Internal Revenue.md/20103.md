####### Relationship to satisfaction of section 410(b) by the plan.

(ii)Satisfaction of section 410(b) by a component plan is relevant solely for purposes of determining whether the plan of which it is a part satisfies section 401(a)(4), and not for purposes of determining whether the plan satisfies section 410(b) itself. The plan must still independently satisfy section 410(b) in order to be a qualified plan. Similarly, satisfaction of section 410(b) by a plan is relevant solely for purposes of determining whether the plan, and not the component plan, satisfies section 410(b). Thus, for example, a component plan that does not satisfy the ratio percentage test of ยง 1.410(b)-2(b)(2) must still satisfy the average benefit test of ยง 1.410(b)-2(b)(3), even though the plan of which it is a part satisfies the ratio percentage test.
