###### ยง 1.410(b)-5 Average benefit percentage test.
####### Plans which may not use permitted disparity.

(ii)Permitted disparity may be reflected in the determination of rates only to the extent that the plans for which rates are being determined are plans for which the permitted disparity of section 401(l) is available. Thus, for example, if a section 401(k) plan is included in the testing group and permitted disparity is imputed under ยง 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(iv), then employee benefit percentages are determined by first calculating an adjusted allocation rate (within the meaning of ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7(b)(1)) without regard to the amount of allocations under the section 401(k) plan and adding to it the allocation rate for the section 401(k) plan. See ยง 1.401(l)-1(a)(4) for a list of types of plans for which permitted disparity is not available.
