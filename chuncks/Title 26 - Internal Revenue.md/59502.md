##### ยง 1.401(l)-3 Permitted disparity for defined benefit plans.
###### PIA offsets.

(ix)In the case of an offset plan, the plan provides that the offset applied to each employee's benefit is the lesser of a specified percentage of the employee's PIA and an offset that otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section (the "section 401(l) overlay"). The specified percentage of PIA must be the same for all employees with the same number of years of service. In the case of a plan that determines each employee's accrued benefit under the fractional accrual method of section 411(b)(1)(C), the specified percentage of PIA is deemed to be the same for all employees with the same number of years of service if the plan satisfies either of the deemed uniformity rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, substituting "offset, expressed as a percentage of PIA, per year of service" for the term "offset percentage" (in addition to satisfying either of those rules with respect to the section 401(l) overlay).
