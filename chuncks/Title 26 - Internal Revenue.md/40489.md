####### Liability from delivery of property.

(vi)If the person who is obligated to deliver property is liable with regard to such delivery, such liability will be considered to result from the activity performed of delivering such property. For example, if a corporation which exports all of its inventory from the United States to foreign countries or possessions of the United States is liable with regard to its failure to make delivery outside the United States of inventory it has sold, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, if a corporation which exports all of its inventory from a foreign country to the United States is liable with regard to its improper delivery in the United States of inventory it has sold, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.
