###### ยง 1.951A-4 Tested interest expense and tested interest income.
####### 2,Tested interest expense and tested interest income of FS2.

()FS2 has $300x of interest expense that is allocated and apportioned to its gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3). FS2 has no interest income. While FS2 holds no qualified assets directly, $4,000x of FS3's average adjusted basis in FS3 stock is treated as adjusted basis in a qualified asset, which is equal to FS3's average adjusted basis in FS3 stock ($6,000x) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is FS3's average adjusted bases in qualified assets ($8,000x), and the denominator of which is FS3's average adjusted bases in all its assets ($12,000x). Accordingly, FS2 has qualified interest expense of $200x, the amount of FS2's interest expense allocated and apportioned to FS2's gross tested income under ยง 1.951A-2(c)(3) ($300x), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is FS2's average adjusted bases in qualified assets ($4,000x), and the denominator of which is FS2's average adjusted bases in all its assets ($6,000x). Therefore, FS2 has tested interest expense of $100x ($300x-$200x) and no tested interest income for Year 1.
