###### ยง 1.461-1 General rule for taxable year of deduction.
####### Exceptions.

(ii)The rule of nonallowance set forth in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is not applicable to a taxpayer in the year in which it liquidates (other than following, or as part of, an acquisition of its assets in which the acquiring corporation, pursuant to section 381(a), takes into account certain items of the taxpayer, which for purposes of this paragraph shall be referred to as an acquisition described in section 381(a)). In addition, such rule of nonallowance is not applicable to a taxpayer which pays or credits grace interest or dividends to terminating depositors or shareholders, provided the total amount of the grace interest or dividends paid or credited during the payment or crediting period (for example, a quarterly or semiannual period) does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the interest or dividends paid or credited during such period, computed without regard to the grace interest or dividends. For example, providing the 10 percent limitation is met, the rule of nonallowance does not apply in a case in which a calendar year taxpayer, with regular interest payment dates of January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, pays grace interest for the period beginning October 1 to a depositor who terminates his account on December 10.
