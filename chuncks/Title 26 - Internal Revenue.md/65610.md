(3)(i) If more than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2)), is collected by an employer from an employee and paid to the IRS, the employee may file a claim for refund of the overpayment and receive a refund or credit if the overcollection cannot be corrected under ยง 31.3503-1 and if the employee has not received repayment or reimbursement from the employer in the context of an interest-free adjustment. The claim for refund shall be made on Form 1040, "U.S. Individual Income Tax Return," by taking the overcollection into account in claiming a credit against, or refund of, tax.

The employee may not authorize the employer to claim the credit or refund for the employee. See ยง 31.6402(a)-2(a)(1)(iii).
