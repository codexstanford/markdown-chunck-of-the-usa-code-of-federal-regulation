####### Time when manufacture, construction or production considered to begin.

(B)For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the acquisition date of such property is the date on which the manufacture, construction, or production of property (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) begins. The manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a factory is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; this could occur, for example, when work begins on the excavation of footings, or the pourings of pads for the factory. Preliminary work, such as clearing or testing of soil condition, does not constitute the beginning of construction.
