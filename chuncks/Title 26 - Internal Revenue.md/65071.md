####### Accounts or instruments that are pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are not post-1983 brokerage accounts.

(2)With respect to a pre-1984 account (as described in ยง 31.3406(d)-1(b)(1)) or with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in ยง 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), a payor or broker is not required to retain any Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form. If, however, the payor or broker requires the payee to file only one Form W-9 or substitute form for all accounts or instruments of the payee, the payor or broker must retain the single form in the manner and for the period of time described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if that form relates to any account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account or relates to a post-1983 brokerage account. If a payee has certified that the payee is an exempt recipient described in ยง 31.3406(g)-1, the payor or broker must retain the form unless the payor or broker can establish the existence of procedures that are reasonably calculated to ensure that a payee who has so certified is accurately identified in the payor's or broker's records.
