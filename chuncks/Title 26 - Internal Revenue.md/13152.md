####### Analysis.

(2)DC has a section 250(a)(2) amount of $100x, which is equal to the excess of the sum of DC's FDII and GILTI of $400x ($100x + $300x) over its taxable income of $300x. As a result, DC's FDII and GILTI are reduced, in the aggregate, by $100x under section 250(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for purposes of calculating DC's deduction allowed under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. DC's FDII is reduced by $25x, the amount that bears the same ratio to the section 250(a)(2) amount ($100x) as DC's FDII ($100x) bears to the sum of DC's FDII and GILTI ($400x). DC's GILTI is reduced by $75x, which is the remainder of the section 250(a)(2) amount ($100x-$25x). Therefore, for purposes of calculating its deduction under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, DC's FDII is $75x ($100x-$25x) and its GILTI is $225x ($300x-$75x). Accordingly, DC is allowed a deduction for the taxable year under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $140.63x ($75x x 0.375 + $225x x 0.50).
