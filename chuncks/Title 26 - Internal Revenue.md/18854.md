####### Presumption regarding net unrealized built-in loss.

(2)For purposes of determining whether a net unrealized built-in loss of a loss corporation is attributable to a taxable year (the determination year) with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group, the built-in loss in a prior change date asset is deemed to be attributable to a period ending before the determination year. A prior change date asset is any asset held by the loss corporation at all times during the period beginning on the change date of its most recent ownership change after 1986 (the first change date), and ending on the first day of the determination year. The built-in loss in a prior change date asset is the amount by which the adjusted basis of the asset on the first change date exceeds the fair market value of the asset on that date. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) also apply to items described in section 382(h)(6)(B).
