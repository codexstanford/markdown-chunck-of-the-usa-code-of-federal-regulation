####### Facilities performing multiple functions or used in connection with several plants, etc.

(3)(i) If a facility is designed to perform or does perform a function in addition to abating or controlling water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing or storing pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, such facility shall be a treatment facility only with respect to that part of the cost thereof which is certified by the Federal certifying authority as attributable to abating of controlling water or atmospheric pollution or contamination. For example, if a machine which performs a function in addition to abating water pollution is installed at a cost of $100,000 in, and is used only in connection with, a plant which was in operation before January 1, 1969, and if the Federal certifying authority certifies that $30,000 of the cost of such machine is allocable to its function of abating water pollution, such $30,000 will be deemed to be the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of ยง 1.169-3.

(ii) If a facility is used in connection with more than one plant or other property, and at least one such plant or other property was not in operation before January 1, 1969, such facility shall be a treatment facility only to the extent of that part of the cost thereof certified by the Federal certifying authority as attributable to abating or controlling water or atmospheric pollution in connection with plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969. For example, if a machine is constructed after December 31, 1968, at a cost of $100,000 and is used in connection with a number of plants only some of which were in operation before January 1, 1969, and if the Federal certifying authority certifies that $20,000 of the cost of such machine is allocable to its function of abating or controlling water pollution in connection with the plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969, such $20,000 will be deemed to be the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of ยง 1.169-3. In a case in which the Federal certifying authority certifies the percentage of a facility which is used in connection with plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969, the adjusted basis for the purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of ยง 1.169-3 of the portion of the facility so used shall be the adjusted basis for determining gain of the entire facility multiplied by such percentage.
