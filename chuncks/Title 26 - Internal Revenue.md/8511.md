####### Analysis.

(B)Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section because X is not leasing at least 90 percent of the real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control that operates an excepted trade or business and/or unrelated parties. Under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 20 percent of the fair market rental value of the real property subleased to an unrelated party because X is treated as directly leasing this portion to an unrelated party. X is not eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 80 percent of the building subleased to a party under common control because X is still treated as directly leasing this portion to a related party. Under ยง 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(D), X must allocate 80 percent of the basis in the real property as a non-excepted trade or business and 20 percent of the basis in the real property as an excepted trade or business.
