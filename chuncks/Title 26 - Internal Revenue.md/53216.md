####### Example 3.

(iii)Since 2012, L has owned all the stock of Lwhich has owned all the stock of S, a nonlife insurance company. Lwrites some accident and health insurance business. In 2018, Ltransfers this business, and Stransfers some of its business, to a new nonlife insurance company, S., in a transaction described in section 351 (a). The property transferred to S. by Lhad a fair market value of $50 million. The property transferred by Shad a fair market value of $40 million. S. is ineligible for 2020 because the tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section does not apply. The old corporations (Land S) and the new corporation (S.) do not all have the same tax character. See subparagraph (b)(12)(v)(B) and (E) of this section. The result would be the same if Ltransferred other property (for example, stock and securities) with the same value, rather than accident and health insurance contracts, to S.
