(B)Because DC failed to file a GRA with its timely filed tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, there is a failure to timely file the GRA as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Furthermore, because DC intentionally chose not to file a GRA for the FS Transfer, its actions constitute a willful failure to timely file a GRA. Accordingly, DC is ineligible for relief under paragraph (p) of this section, the GRA is not considered timely filed for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC must recognize the full amount of the gain realized on the FS Transfer in Year 1.
