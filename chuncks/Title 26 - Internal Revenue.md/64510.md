###### ยง 31.3401(a)-4 Reimbursements and other expense allowance amounts.
####### Per diem or mileage allowances.

(ii)If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement providing a per diem or mileage allowance satisfies the requirements of section 62(c) and ยง 1.62-2, but the allowance is paid at a rate for each day or mile of travel that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for a day or mile of travel, the excess portion is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan and is included in wages. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as a reimbursement, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes when paid. In the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as an advance, the excess portion is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the expenses with respect to which the advance was paid (i.e., the days or miles of travel) are substantiated. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe special rules in pronouncements of general applicability regarding the timing of withholding and payment of employment taxes on per diem and mileage allowances.
