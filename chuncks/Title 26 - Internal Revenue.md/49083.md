####### Certificates.

(a)(1) The optional provision contained in section 1402(e)(5)(A) may be applied to a certificate on Form 2031 filed within the period September 14, 1960, to April 16, 1962, inclusive, in the case of a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, a member of a religious order (other than a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty as a member of such order), or a Christian Science practitioner, who has derived net earnings, in any taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960, from the performance of service in the exercise of his ministry, in the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, respectively, and who has reported such earnings as self-employment income on a return filed before September 14, 1960, and on or before the date prescribed for filing such return (including any extension thereof). The certificate may be filed by such minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner or by a fiduciary acting for such individual or his estate, or by his survivor within the meaning of section 205(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act, and it must be filed after September 13, 1960, and on or before April 16, 1962. Subject to the conditions stated in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such certificate may be effective at the election of the person filing it, for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which a return, as described in the first sentence of this subparagraph, was filed, and for all succeeding taxable years, rather than for the period prescribed in ยง 1.1402(e)(3)-1. The election for retroactive application of the certificate may be made by indicating on the certificate the first taxable year for which it is to be effective and that such year is the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which the minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner filed an income tax return on which he reported net earnings for such year from the exercise of his ministry, the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be, and by fulfilling the conditions prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.

(2) A certificate to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph relates may be effective for a taxable year prior to the taxable year immediately preceding the earliest taxable year for which, at the time the certificate is filed, the period for filing a return (including any extension thereof) has not expired, only if the following conditions are met:

(i) The tax under section 1401 is paid on or before April 16, 1962, in respect of all self-employment income (whether or not derived from the performance of service by the individual in the exercise of his ministry, in the exercise of duties required by his religious order, or in the exercise of his profession as a Christian Science practitioner, as the case may be) for the first taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1960 for which such individual has filed a return, as described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and for each succeeding taxable year ending before 1960; and

(ii) In any case where refund has been made of any such tax which (but for section 1402(e)(5)) is an overpayment, the amount refunded (including any interest paid under section 6611) is repaid on or before April 16, 1962. For regulations under section 6611 (relating to interest on overpayments), see ยง 301.6611-1 of part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
