###### § 1.1502-14Z Application of opportunity zone rules to members of a consolidated group.
####### Application of § 1.1502-36(d).

(e)This paragraph (e) clarifies how § 1.1502-36(d) applies if a member (M) transfers a loss share of another member (S) that is a QOF owner that owns a qualifying investment. To determine S's attribute reduction amount under § 1.1502-36(d)(3), S's basis in its qualifying investment is included in S's net inside attribute amount to compute S's aggregate inside loss under § 1.1502-36(d)(3)(iii)(A). However, S's basis in the qualifying investment is not included in S's Category D attributes available for attribute reduction under § 1.1502-36(d)(4). Thus, S's basis in the qualifying investment cannot be reduced under § 1.1502-36(d). If S's attribute reduction amount exceeds S's attributes available for reduction, then to the extent of the lesser of S's basis in the qualifying investment or the remaining attribute reduction amount, the common parent is treated as making the election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reduce M's basis in the transferred loss S shares.
