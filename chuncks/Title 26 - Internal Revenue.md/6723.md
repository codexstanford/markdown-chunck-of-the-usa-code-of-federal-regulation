(f)If a taxpayer elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under § 1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts paid for the production or acquisition of tangible property, then the taxpayer must apply the de minimis safe harbor to amounts paid for all materials and supplies that meet the requirements of § 1.263(a)-1(f), except for those materials and supplies that the taxpayer elects to capitalize and depreciate under paragraph (d) of this section or for which the taxpayer properly uses the optional method of accounting for rotable and temporary spare parts under paragraph (e) of this section.

See § 1.263(a)-1(f)(5) for the time and manner of electing the de minimis safe harbor and § 1.263(a)-1(f)(3)(iv) for the treatment of safe harbor amounts.
