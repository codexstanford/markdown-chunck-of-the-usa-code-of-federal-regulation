####### § 301.9100-1 Extensions of time to make elections.
######## Introduction.

(a)The regulations under this section and §§ 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 provide the standards the Commissioner will use to determine whether to grant an extension of time to make a regulatory election. The regulations under this section and § 301.9100-2 also provide an automatic extension of time to make certain statutory elections. An extension of time is available for elections that a taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make. However, the granting of an extension of time is not a determination that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. Section 301.9100-2 provides automatic extensions of time for making regulatory and statutory elections when the deadline for making the election is the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions. Section 301.9100-3 provides extensions of time for making regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of § 301.9100-2.
