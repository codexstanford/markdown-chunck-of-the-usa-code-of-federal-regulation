For purposes of the preceding sentence, if an obligation is acquired as part of an investment unit consisting of an option, security, or other property and an obligation, the purchase price of the obligation is that portion of the price paid or payable for the unit which is allocable to the obligation. The price paid for the unit shall be allocated to the individual elements of the unit on the basis of their respective fair market values. However, if the fair market value of the option, security, or other property is not readily ascertainable (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of ยง 1.421-6), then the price paid for the unit shall be allocated in accordance with the rules under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for allocating the initial offering price of an investment unit to its elements. If, under chapter 1 of the Code, the basis of an obligation in the hands of the holder is the same, in whole or in part, for the purposes of determining gain or loss from a sale or exchange, as the basis of the obligation in the hands of another person who purchased the obligation at a premium, then the holder shall be considered to have purchased the obligation at a premium. Thus, the donee of an obligation purchased at a premium by the doner will be considered a holder who purchased the obligation at a premium.
