() S2 directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P and X each is treated as constructively owning an additional 12.5% of the stock of S1. Under a second application of section 318(a)(2)(C) as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P and X each constructively owns an additional 6.25% of the stock of S1 as follows: 12.5% (each of P's and X's new attributed ownership of S1) x 100% (S1's ownership of S2) x 50% (S2's ownership of S1) = 6.25%. After two iterations, each of P's and X's ownership in S1 is 43.75% (25% direct ownership + 12.5% first order constructive ownership + 6.25% second order constructive ownership). Subsequent iterative calculations of each of P's and X's ownership, treating constructive ownership as actual ownership, would demonstrate that P and X each owns, directly and indirectly, 50% of the stock of S1.
