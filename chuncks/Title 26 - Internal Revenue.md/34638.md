(27)-(i)Assume the same facts as in paragraph (g)(25)(i) of this section (the facts in), except that state A, in which USP has significant income-producing activities, does not impose a corporate income tax or other state tax computed on the basis of income derived from business activities conducted in state A. USP therefore has a total state income tax liability in Year 1 of $14,000x ($10,000x paid to state B plus $4,000x paid to state C), all of which is subject to allocation and apportionment under paragraph (b) of this section.
