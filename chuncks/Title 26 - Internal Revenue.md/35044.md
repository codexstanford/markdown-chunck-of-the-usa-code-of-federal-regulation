###### ยง 1.861-13 Special rules for characterization of controlled foreign corporation stock.
####### Step 4: Aggregate stock within each separate category and assign stock to the residual grouping.

(4)The portions of the value of stock of the controlled foreign corporation assigned to foreign source statutory groupings that were not specifically assigned to the section 951A category under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (Step 2) are aggregated within the general category and the passive category to characterize the stock as general category stock and passive category stock, respectively. The portions of the value of stock of the controlled foreign corporation assigned to U.S. source statutory groupings that were not specifically assigned to a particular treaty category under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (Step 3) are aggregated to characterize the stock as U.S. source category stock, which is in the residual grouping. Stock assigned to the separate category for income described in section 901(j)(1) remains in that category.
