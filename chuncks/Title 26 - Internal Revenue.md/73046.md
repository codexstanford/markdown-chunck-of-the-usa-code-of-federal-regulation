####### ยง 301.6225-2 Modification of imputed underpayment.
######## Rate modification in the case of special allocations.

(iv)If an imputed underpayment results from adjustments to more than one partnership-related item and any relevant partner for whom modification described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is approved has a distributive share of such items that is not the same with respect to all such items, the imputed underpayment as modified based on the modification types described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is determined as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section except that each relevant partner's distributive share is determined based on the amount of net gain or loss to the partner that would have resulted if the partnership had sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the close of the reviewed year appropriately adjusted to reflect any approved modification under paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (5) through (10) of this section with respect to any relevant partner. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the partnership may request that the IRS apply the rule in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section when determining each relevant partner's distributive share for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv). Upon request by the IRS, the partnership may be required to provide the relevant partners' capital account calculation through the end of the reviewed year, a calculation of asset liquidation gain or loss, and any other information necessary to determine whether rate modification is appropriate, consistent with the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Any calculation by the partnership that is necessary to comply with the rules in this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) is not considered a revaluation for purposes of section 704.
