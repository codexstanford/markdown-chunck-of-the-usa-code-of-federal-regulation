(B)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section (the facts in), except that CFC uses the modified gross income method to apportion interest expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the unrelated person interest expense is apportioned based on gross income. Therefore, $33x of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to CFC's passive category income ($33x = $100x x ($200x - $150x)/($300x - $150x)) and $67x of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to CFC's general category income ($67x = $100x x $100x/($300x - $150x)).
