####### Deposits.

(2)Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited shall be accompanied by a Federal Tax Deposit form which shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the remittance, together with the form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for such period.
