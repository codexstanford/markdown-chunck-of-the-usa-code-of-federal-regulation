####### Separate amendments for different plan populations.

(C)In lieu of a single amendment that applies to both currently employed participants and other participants as described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the employer can adopt multiple amendments-such as one that increases benefits for participants currently employed on the effective date of the current amendment and another one that increases benefits for other participants. In that case, the two amendments are considered separately in determining the increase in average wages, and the exception in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) applies separately to each amendment. Thus, the increase in benefits for currently employed participants takes effect if it satisfies the exception under this paragraph (c)(4), but the amendment increasing benefits for other participants who received no increase in wages from the employer during the period over which the increase in average wages is separately subject to the rules of this paragraph (c) without regard to the rules of this paragraph (c)(4).
