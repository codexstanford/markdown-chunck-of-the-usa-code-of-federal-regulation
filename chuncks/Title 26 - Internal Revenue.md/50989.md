####### Reason to know.

(iii)In addition to the general standards of knowledge described in paragraph (e) of this section, a withholding agent will have reason to know that an entity is not a territory financial institution if the withholding agent has: a current residence or mailing address, either in the entity's account files or on documentation provided by the payee, for the entity that is outside the U.S. territory in which the entity claims to be organized; a current telephone number for the payee that has a country code other than the country code for the U.S. territory or has an area code other than the area code(s) of the applicable U.S. territory and no telephone number for the payee in the applicable U.S. territory; or standing instructions for the withholding agent to pay amounts from its account to an address or account outside the applicable U.S. territory. A withholding agent that has knowledge of a current address, current telephone number, or standing payment instructions for the entity outside of the applicable U.S. territory, may nevertheless treat the entity as a territory financial institution if it obtains documentary evidence that establishes that the entity was organized in the applicable U.S. territory.
