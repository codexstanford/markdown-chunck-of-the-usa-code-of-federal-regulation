####### Reasonable techniques permitted.

(ii)In the case of a plan sponsor using the monthly corporate bond yield curve under this paragraph (e)(4), if with respect to a decrement the benefit is only expected to be paid for one-half of a year (because the decrement was assumed to occur in the middle of the year), the interest rate for that year can be determined as if the benefit were being paid for the entire year. See ยง 1.430(d)-1(f)(7) for additional reasonable techniques that can be used in determining present value.
