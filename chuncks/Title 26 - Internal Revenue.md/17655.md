####### Result.

(B)The year 3 disposition of the TFC stock is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The disposition does not terminate the gain recognition agreement pursuant to paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section because the basis of each share of TFC stock received in exchange for the TFD stock in the initial transfer is $5.5x, which exceeds the $0x basis of the TFD stock at time of the initial transfer. However, under paragraph (o)(1)(iii) of this section, to satisfy the basis condition of paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section, UST can reduce the basis of the 10 shares of the TFC stock received in exchange for the TFD stock to $0x. If UST reduces the basis of the 10 shares of TFC stock to $0x, under paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section the disposition of the TFC stock shall not constitute a triggering event but instead shall terminate the gain recognition agreement without further effect.
