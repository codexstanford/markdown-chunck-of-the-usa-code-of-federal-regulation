###### ยง 1.852-4 Method of taxation of shareholders of regulated investment companies.
####### c

() In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company beginning after December 31, 1974, by 70 percent of such amount.

(iv) For purposes of determining whether the purchaser or seller of a share or regulated investment company stock is the shareholder at the close of such company's taxable year who is required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income, the amount of the undistributed capital gains shall be treated in the same manner as a cash dividend payable to shareholders of record at the close of the company's taxable year. Thus, if a cash dividend paid to shareholders of record as of the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year would be considered income to the purchaser, then the purchaser is also considered to be the shareholder of such company at the close of its taxable year for purposes of including an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income. If, in such a case, notice on Form 2439 is, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of ยง 1.852-9, mailed by the regulated investment company to the seller, then the seller shall be considered the nominee of the purchaser and, as such, shall be subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of ยง 1.852-9. For rules for determining whether a dividend is income to the purchaser or seller of a share of stock, see paragraph (c) of ยง 1.61-9.
