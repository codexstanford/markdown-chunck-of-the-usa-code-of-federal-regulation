####### Tax treatment of patron.

(f)(1) The following rules apply for purposes of computing the amount includible in gross income with respect to a per-unit retain certificate which was issued to a patron by a cooperative association with respect to a taxable year of such association for which paragraph (d) of this section applies.

(i) If the patron is a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate (within the meaning of paragraph (d) (2) of this section), he shall, in accordance with his agreement, include (as ordinary income) the stated dollar amount of the certificate in gross income for his taxable year in which the certificate is received by him.

(ii) If the patron is not a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate, no amount is includible in gross income on the receipt of the certificate; however, any gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of such certificate shall, to the extent of the stated dollar amount thereof, be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is not a capital asset.

(2) The amount of the fair market value of a per-unit retain certificate which is issued to a patron by a cooperative association with respect to a taxable year of the association for which paragraph (d) of this section does not apply shall be included, as ordinary income, in the gross income of the patron for the taxable year in which the certificate is received. Any gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of such a per-unit retain certificate shall, to the extent its stated dollar amount exceeds its fair market value at the time of issue, be treated as gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of property which is not a capital asset.
