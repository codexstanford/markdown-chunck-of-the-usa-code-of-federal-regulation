####### Exception.

(b)The last sentence of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if all exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970, and deducted by him on his income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which he pays or incurs such expenditures are outside the scope of section 617(a) (as it existed before its amendment by section 504(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969). For example, assume that, in his return for his taxable year ending December 31, 1966, a calendar-year taxpayer deducts exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not attach to his return the statement described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable year were paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in the United States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will be deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all or part of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.
