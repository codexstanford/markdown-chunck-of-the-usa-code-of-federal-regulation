(a)For purposes of this section, the term "controlled group of corporations" has the same meaning as is assigned to the term in section 1563(a) and the regulations thereunder, except that (1) the term "controlled group of corporations" shall not include an "insurance group" described in section 1563(a)(4), and (2) section 1563(e)(3)(C) (relating to stock owned by certain employees' trusts) shall not apply. For purposes of this section, the term "members of a controlled group" means two or more corporations connected through stock ownership described in section 1563(a) (1), (2), or (3), whether or not such corporations are "component members of a controlled group" within the meaning of section 1563(b). Two or more corporations are members of a controlled group at any time such corporations meet the requirements of section 1563(a) (as modified by this paragraph). For purposes of this section, if a corporation is a member of more than one controlled group of corporations, such corporation shall be treated as a member of each controlled group.
