###### ยง 301.7701-13 Pre-1970 domestic building and loan association.
####### Business operations test,In general.

(c)-(1)An association must utilize its assets so that substantially all of its business consists of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section. The requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the prescribed loans includes ancillary or incidental activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even though an association meets the supervisory test in paragraph (b) and all the assets tests described in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building and loan association if any substantial part of its business consists of activities which are not directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as brokering mortgage paper, selling insurance, or subdividing real estate. However, an association will meet the business operations test for a taxable year if it meets the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating respectively to acquiring the savings of the public, and investing in loans.
