######## Adjustment to a creditable expenditure,In general.

(ii)-(A)For purposes of this section, an adjustment to a partnership-related item is treated as an adjustment to a creditable expenditure if any person could take the item that is adjusted (or item as adjusted if the item was not originally reported by the partnership) as a credit. See ยง 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) of this chapter. For instance, if the adjustment is a reduction of qualified research expenses, the adjustment is to a creditable expenditure for purposes of this section because any person allocated the qualified research expenses by the partnership could claim a credit with respect to their allocable portion of such expenses under section 41, rather than a deduction under section 174.
