####### Change in tax character.

(vii)A corporation must not experience during the base period a change in tax character (as defined in paragraph (b)(12)(v)(B) of this section) if the change is attributable to an acquisition of assets from outside the group in transactions not conducted in the ordinary course of its trade or business. However, if a new corporation relies on the tacking rules in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section, this paragraph (b)(12)(vii) shall apply during the base period and the current consolidated return year even if the change in tax character is attributable to an asset acquisition from within the group.
