####### Rule for overestimates.

(3)An insurance company is required under section 11305(c)(4) of the 1990 Act to include in gross income 87 percent of any amount (adjusted for discounting) by which the section 481 adjustment is overestimated. The rule is applied by comparing the amount of the section 481 adjustment (determined without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and any discounting) to the sum of the actual salvage recoveries and remaining undiscounted estimated salvage recoverable that are attributable to losses incurred in accident years beginning before 1990. For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, any excess of the section 481 adjustment over this sum (reduced by amounts treated as overestimates in prior taxable years pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3)) is an overestimate. To determine the amount to be included in income, it is necessary to discount this excess and multiply the resulting amount by 87 percent.
