####### Special rule for employers using annual option under section 410(b).

(4)Notwithstanding the fact that paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section generally only require employees to be assigned on testing days beginning with the first testing day, if a plan is tested under section 410(b) using the annual option of ยง 410(b)-8(a)(4) (including for purposes of the average benefit percentage test), employees must be assigned on every day of the plan year of that plan for purposes of this paragraph (b). Thus, all employees who provide services at any time during the plan year of a plan that is tested using the annual option of ยง 1.410(b)-8(a)(4) must be assigned to a line of business even if they terminate employment before the first testing day within the meaning of ยง 414(r)-11(b)(7) of the testing year in which the plan year begins.
