(7)The corporation has the burden of establishing under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section that it made a good faith effort to comply. For example, if a corporation shows that it has made a good faith effort to establish the fair market value of the employer securities transferred to the TRASOP, it may be entitled to the additional credit even if, on later examination of the return, it is determined that more securities should have been transferred. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(7), reasonable reliance on Technical Information Release 1413 (1975-50 I.R.B. 16), questions and answers relating to ESOP's, is a good faith effort to comply.
