####### Payments to participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, and certain QIs.,2

(B)Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B), a U.S. withholding agent that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT must complete a Form 1042-S treating such FFI as the recipient. With respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT or QI that elects to be withheld upon under section 1471(b)(3) and from whom the withholding agent receives an FFI withholding statement allocating the payment (or portion of the payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool, a U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) as the recipient with respect to each such pool identified on an FFI withholding statement, described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(). If, however, a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) has made an election under § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii), for the portion of the payment that the FFI allocates to each recalcitrant account holder that is subject to backup withholding under section 3406, the withholding agent must report on Form 1099 the amount of the payment and tax withheld in accordance with the form's requirements and accompanying instructions. See § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(i) for the requirement of a withholding agent to withhold on payments of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii) in the case of payments made to a QI. See § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required under that section for U.S. source FDAP income that is reportable on Form 1042-S under chapter 3 and not subject to withholding under chapter 4, in which case the U.S. withholding agent must report in the manner described under § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for reporting rules applicable if participating FFIs or deemed-compliant FFIs provide specific payee information for reporting to the recipient of the payment for Form 1042-S reporting purposes. See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the residual reporting responsibilities of an NQI, NWP, or NWT that is an FFI.
