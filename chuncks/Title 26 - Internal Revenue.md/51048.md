()For a payment made after December 31, 2016, to a payee that the withholding agent has documented prior to January 1, 2017, as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE with a valid withholding certificate that includes the GIIN of the sponsoring entity, the withholding agent must obtain and verify the GIIN of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section by March 31, 2017. A withholding agent required to obtain a GIIN of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE in the preceding sentence may obtain such GIIN by oral or written confirmation (including by email) rather than obtaining a new withholding certificate, provided that the withholding agent retains a record of the confirmation, which will become part of the withholding certificate.
