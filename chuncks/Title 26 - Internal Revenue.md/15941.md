(b)-(1)If, for the taxable year which includes June 30, 1972, (i) the allowance for depreciation of any property is computed under a method other than the straight line method or a method described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and (ii) paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to such property for the first taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972, then adjustments to earnings and profits for depreciation of such property for taxable years beginning after June 30, 1972, shall be determined as if the corporation changed to the straight line method with respect to such property as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972. Thus, if an election under ยง 1.167 (a)-11 is in effect with respect to the property, the change shall be made under the provisions of ยง 1.167(a)-11(c)(1)(iii), except that no statement setting forth the vintage accounts for which the change is made shall be furnished with the income tax return of the year of change if the change is only for purposes of computing earnings and profits. In all other cases, the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property (less a reasonable estimate for salvage) as of such first day shall be recovered through equal annual allowances over the estimated remaining useful life determined in accordance with the circumstances existing at that time. See paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section for rules relating to the applicability of section 167(f) in determining salvage value.
