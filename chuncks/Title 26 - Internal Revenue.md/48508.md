()If the contributions had been of property other than cash, the contributions and distributions would have been tested under the disguised sale rules of section 707 and the regulations in this part under section 707 of the Code, determining the timing of the distribution and amount of the debt allocated to each partner. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)() of this section, the cash of $200 ($100 from A and $100 from B) is treated as property that could be sold in a disguised sale transaction and each partner's share of the debt is zero for purposes of determining the amount of the qualifying investment. To the extent there would have been a disguised sale applying the rule of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)() of this section, the amount of the qualifying investment would be reduced by the amount of the contribution so recharacterized.
