() In the case of an amount described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)()() of this section, the rules for determining how a disregarded payment is allocated to gross income of a foreign branch or foreign branch owner in ยง 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(B) are applied by treating the disregarded payment as allocated and apportioned ratably to all of the gross income attributable to the tested unit that is making the disregarded payment. If a tested unit is both a payor and payee of an amount described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)()() of this section, gross income to which the disregarded payments are allocable include gross income allocated to the payor tested unit as a result of the receipt of amounts described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)()() of this section, to the extent thereof. If a tested unit makes and receives payments described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)()() of this section to and from the same tested unit, the payments are netted so that paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B)()() of this section and the principles of ยง 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) apply only to the net amount of such payments between the two tested units.
