###### ยง 1.7701(l)-3 Recharacterizing financing arrangements involving fast-pay stock.
####### Relationship between benefited shareholders and fast-pay shareholders.

(i)The benefited shareholders issue financial instruments (the financing instruments) directly to the fast-pay shareholders in exchange for cash equal to the fair market value of the fast-pay stock at the time of issuance (taking into account any related agreements). The financing instruments have the same terms (other than issuer) as the fast-pay stock. Thus, for example, the timing and amount of the payments made with respect to the financing instruments always match the timing and amount of the distributions made with respect to the fast-pay stock.
