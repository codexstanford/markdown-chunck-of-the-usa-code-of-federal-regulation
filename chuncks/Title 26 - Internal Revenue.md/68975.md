###### ยง 53.4960-2 Determination of remuneration paid for a taxable year.
####### Conclusion (Amounts other than regular wages).

(iii)The $10,000 bonus is not regular wages within the meaning of ยง 31.3402(g)-1(a)(1)(ii) because it is not an amount paid at a periodic rate for the current payroll period. Thus, $10,000 is treated as remuneration paid on December 31, 2023 (when it is vested) and, therefore, is treated as remuneration paid in ATEO 5's 2023 applicable year.
