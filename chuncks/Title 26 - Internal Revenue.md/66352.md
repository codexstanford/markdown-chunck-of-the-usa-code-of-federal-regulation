####### State or local government.

(2)For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section a "vessel is being used by a State or local government" if it is operated by any State, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision of a State. If a private party is contracted to haul for a State or local government, the vessel is not "being used by a State or local government." Similarly, if a person other than a State or local government is contracted to supply vessel operators, the fuel consumed by the vessel is not used "by a State or local government," regardless of ownership of the vessel. However, when a local government leases barges and employees of the local government operate the barges, the vessel is being used by the local government.
