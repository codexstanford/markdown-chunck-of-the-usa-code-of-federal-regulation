####### Example 1,Facts.

(i)-(A)During 2021, A enters into a contract with Customer to manufacture and deliver a good with a total contract price of $100x. The costs to produce the good are required to be capitalized under sections 471 and 263A as the good is inventory in the hands of A. Ownership of the good is transferred from A to Customer upon its delivery in 2022. A determines, under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, that its AFS inventory inclusion amount for 2021 is $20x. A incurs $12x of costs in 2021, and $48x of costs in 2022 ($60x in total) that are permissibly capitalized and allocated to the produced good under sections 471 and 263A. A has a fixed right to receive the $100x contract price when it delivers the good in 2022. A does not receive any payments from Customer prior to delivery. Further, all $100x is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" as of the last day of 2022.
