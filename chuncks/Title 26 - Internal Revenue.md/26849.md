####### Definition of Applicable Financial Statement (AFS).

(ii)The term applicable financial statement (AFS) is defined in section 451(b)(3) and the accompanying regulations. See ยง 1.451-3(a)(5). The rules relating to additional AFS issues provided in ยง 1.451-3(h) apply to the AFS section 471(c) inventory method. In the case of a taxpayer with a financial accounting year that differs from the taxpayer's taxable year, the taxpayer must consistently use the same method of accounting described in ยง 1.451-3(h)(4)(i)(A) through (C) that is used for section 451(b) purposes to also determine its inventory for the taxable year under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii). A taxpayer has an AFS for the taxable year if all of the taxpayer's taxable year is covered by an AFS.
