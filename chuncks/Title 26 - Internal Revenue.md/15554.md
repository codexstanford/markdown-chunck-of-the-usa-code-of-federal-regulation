## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Items Not Deductible
###### ยง 1.279-7 Effect on other provisions.

Under section 279(j), no inference is to be drawn from any provision in section 279 and the regulations thereunder that any instrument designated as a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness by its issuer represents an obligation or indebtedness of such issuer in applying any other provision of this title. Thus, for example, an instrument, the interest on which is not subject to disallowance under section 279 could, under section 385 and the regulations thereunder, be found to constitute a stock interest, so that any amounts paid or payable thereon would not be deductible.
