###### ยง 1.382-8 Controlled groups.
####### Transition rule,In general.

(2)-(i)The members of a controlled group on January 1, 1997, that have had an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss before January 1, 1997, must determine the limitations under section 382 for any post-change year with respect to controlled group losses by using a reasonable method to preclude the value of stock of a component member that was owned directly or indirectly by another member immediately after an ownership change from being taken into account more than once in determining the limitations under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses. If such a reasonable method was not used for a post-change year, subject to the exception in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the members of the controlled group described in the preceding sentence must reduce their limitations under section 382 for post-change years for which the income tax return is filed after January 1, 1997, to recapture, as quickly as possible, any limitation that members took into account in excess of the amount that would be allowable under this section.
