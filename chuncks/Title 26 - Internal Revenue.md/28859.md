###### ยง 1.509(a)-7 Reliance by grantors and contributors to section 509(a) (1), (2), and (3) organizations.
####### General rule.

(a)Once an organization has received a final ruling or determination letter classifying it as an organization described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3), the treatment of grants and contributions and the status of grantors and contributors to such organization under sections 170, 507, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 2055, 2106(a)(2), and 2522 will not be affected by reason of a subsequent revocation by the service of the organization's classification as described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) until the date on which notice of change of status is made to the public (such as by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin) or another applicable date, if any, specified in such public notice. In appropriate cases, however, the treatment of grants and contributions and the status of grantors and contributors to an organization described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) may be affected pending verification of the continued classification of such organization under section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3). Notice to this affect will be made in a public announcement by the service. In such cases the effect of grants and contributions made after the date of the announcement will depend upon the statutory qualification of the organization as an organization described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3).
