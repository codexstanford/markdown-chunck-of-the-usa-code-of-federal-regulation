####### Example 3.

(iii)Domestic corporation USP operates in branch form in foreign countries X and Y. The branches are qualified business units (QBUs), within the meaning of section 989(a). In Year 1, QBU X earns passive royalty income, interest income, and rental income. All of the QBU X passive income is from Country Z sources. The royalty income is not subject to a withholding tax, and is not taxed by Country X, and the interest and the rental income are subject to a 4% and 10% withholding tax, respectively. QBU Y earns interest income in Country Y that is not subject to foreign tax. For purposes of determining whether USP's foreign source passive income is high-taxed income, the rental income and the interest income earned in QBU X are treated as one item of income pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The interest income earned in QBU Y and the royalty income earned in QBU X are each treated as a separate item of income under paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If, after allocation of expenses, QBU X's items of income composed of rental income and interest income are high-taxed income, the income may be treated as foreign branch category income.
