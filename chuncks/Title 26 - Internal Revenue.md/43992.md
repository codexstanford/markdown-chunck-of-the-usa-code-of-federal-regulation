####### Sale of land with unharvested crop.

(g)In the case of an unharvested crop which is sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted with the land and which is considered as property used in the trade or business under section 1231, the basis of such crop shall be increased by the amount of the items which are attributable to the production of such crop and which are disallowed, under section 268, as deductions in computing taxable income. The basis of any other property shall be decreased by the amount of any such items which are attributable to such other property, notwithstanding any provisions of section 1016 or of this section to the contrary. For example, if the items attributable to the production of an unharvested crop consist only of fertilizer costing $100 and $50 depreciation on a tractor used only to cultivate such crop, and such items are disallowed under section 268, the adjustments to the basis of such crop shall include an increase of $150 for such items and the adjustments to the basis of the tractor shall incude a reduction of $50 for depreciation.
