####### Alternative facts.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(19)(i) of this section, except that the Country X mirror legislation also applies to losses attributable to DE1, but the mirror agreement does not apply to such losses. The mirror legislation rule would apply with respect to P's interest in DE1and, as a result, there is a deemed foreign use of the dual consolidated loss attributable to the Country X separate unit and a domestic use election cannot be made for such loss. This is the case even though, pursuant to ยง 1.1503(d)-5(c)(4)(ii)(A), P's interest in DE1(which is subject to the Country X mirror legislation) does not, as an individual separate unit, have a dual consolidated loss in year 1. Further, the stand-alone exception to the mirror legislation rule in ยง 1.1503(d)-3(e)(2) does not apply because, absent the mirror legislation, the Country X combined separate unit's dual consolidated loss would be available in the year incurred for a foreign use (as defined in ยง 1.1503(d)-3) because it could be used to offset income of FSunder the Country X consolidation regime. This is the case even if Country X requires an election to consolidate and no such election is made. The result would be the same even if Country X did not recognize DE1as having a loss.
