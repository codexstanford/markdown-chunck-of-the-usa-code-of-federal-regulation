##### Items Specifically Excluded From Gross Income
###### ยง 1.132-1 Exclusion from gross income for certain fringe benefits.
####### Customers not to include employees.

(d)For purposes of section 132 and the regulations thereunder, the term "customer" means any customer who is not an employee. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to section 132(c)(2) (relating to the gross profit percentage for determining a qualified employee discount). Thus, an employer that provides employee discounts cannot exclude sales made to employees in determining the aggregate sales to customers.
