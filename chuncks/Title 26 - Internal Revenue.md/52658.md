() After deduction of $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $10 ($10 x 80 percent = $8). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $10, and $35 remains in the cumulative register ($45-$10).
