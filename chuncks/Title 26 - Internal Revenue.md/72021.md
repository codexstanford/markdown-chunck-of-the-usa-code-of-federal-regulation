####### ยง 301.6057-1 Employee retirement benefit plans; identification of participant with deferred vested retirement benefit.
######## Plans subject to filing requirement.

(3)The term "employee retirement benefit plan" means a plan to which the vesting standards of section 203 of part 2 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 854) apply for any day in the plan year. (For purposes of this section, "plan year" means the plan year as determined for purposes of the annual return required by section 6058(a)). Accordingly, a plan need not be a qualified plan within the meaning of section 401(a) to be subject to these filing requirements. A plan to which more than one employer contributes must file the report of deferred vested retirement benefits described in this section, but see paragraph (b) of this section for special rules applicable to such a plan. The filing requirements described in this section and ยง 301.6057-2 (relating to notification of change in plan status) do not apply to a governmental or church plan described in section 414 (d) or (e).
