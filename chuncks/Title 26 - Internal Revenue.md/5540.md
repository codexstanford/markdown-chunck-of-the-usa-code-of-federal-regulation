####### Application only to purpose investments,In general.

(2)-(i)A loan may be either a purpose investment or a nonpurpose investment. A loan that is a nonpurpose investment does not cause the private loan financing test to be met. For example, proceeds invested in loans, such as obligations of the United States, during a temporary period, as part of a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund, as part of a refunding escrow, or as part of a minor portion (as each of those terms are defined in ยง 1.148-1 or ยง 1.148-2) are generally not treated as loans under the private loan financing test.
