(xxi)-(A)In 2021, X, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, enters into a contract to sell 1,000 units to W, a wholesaler, for $10 per unit, totaling $10,000 (1,000 x $10 = $10,000). The contract also provides that X will credit W $4 per unit (chargeback) for sales W makes to qualifying customers. X delivers 600 units to W on December 31, 2021, and bills W $6,000 under the contract. X anticipates that all of W's sales will be to qualifying customers and subject to chargeback. For AFS purposes, X adjusts its 2021 AFS revenue of $6,000 by $2,400, the anticipated chargebacks, and reports $3,600 of AFS revenue.
