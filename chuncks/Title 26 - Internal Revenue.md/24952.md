####### Example 10: Insurance claims administration,Facts.

(x)-(A)L is in the business of negotiating, placing, and servicing insurance coverage and administering claims for insurance companies. On December 1, 2021, L enters into a contract with an insurance company to provide property and casualty claims administration services for a 4-year period beginning January 1, 2022. Pursuant to the contract, the insurance company makes four equal annual payments to L; each payment relates to a year of service and is made during the month prior to the service year. Since L does not perform any services related to the payment prior to the service year, L does not meet the requirements of ยง 1.451-1(a) for the payment prior to the service year. For example, L is paid on December 1, 2021, for the service year beginning January 1, 2022. L takes into account the first payment as AFS revenue for 2022; the second payment as AFS revenue for 2023; the third payment as AFS revenue for 2024; and the fourth payment as AFS revenue for 2025.
