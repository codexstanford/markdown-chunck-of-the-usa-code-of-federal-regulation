## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter D - Miscellaneous Excise Taxes
#### PART 145 - TEMPORARY EXCISE TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE HIGHWAY REVENUE ACT OF 1982 (PUB. L. 97-424)
##### ยง 145.4052-1 Special rules and definitions.
###### Certain sales made prior to November 12, 1985.

(2)If a sale to a lessor before November 12, 1985, was not taxable under ยง 145.4052-1 of the temporary regulations contained in 26 CFR part 145 revised as of April 1, 1983, (the "prior regulations") and it was so treated by the parties, a subsequent sale or lease that was or would have been treated as the first retail sale of the article under the prior regulations will be treated as a taxable sale for purposes of this section. The tax on such subsequent sale will be based on a price determined under paragraph (d) of this section. For example, if an article was sold to a purchaser who intended to lease such article long-term, the sale would not have been taxable under the prior regulations even though the seller did not receive a certificate of the purchaser's intent to lease the vehicle. If such a sale was treated as nontaxable by the parties, and the purchaser leases it long-term on or after October 1, 1987, the lease will be treated as a taxable sale of the article. The tax is to be computed under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and the price will be computed under paragraph (d)(5).
