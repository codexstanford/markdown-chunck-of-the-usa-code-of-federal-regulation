(ii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this section, whether coverage under X's plan is affordable for E is determined for the remainder of X's plan year (May through August). E's required contribution for a full plan year ($1,800) exceeds 9.5 percent of E's household income (1,800/18,000 = 10 percent). Therefore, the Exchange determines that X's coverage is unaffordable for May through August. Although E's actual household income for 2015 is $20,000 (and E's required contribution of $1,800 does not exceed 9.5 percent of E's household income), under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A)() of this section, X's plan is unaffordable for E for the part of the plan year May through August 2015. Consequently, E is not eligible for minimum essential coverage under X's plan for the period May through August 2015.
