(ii)In Year 2, PRS's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI, or $30x ($100x x 30 percent). Thus, PRS has $30x of deductible business interest expense and $18x of excess business interest expense ($48x-$30x). The $30x of deductible business interest expense is includible in PRS's non-separately stated income or loss, and is not subject to further limitation under section 163(j) at the partners' level.
