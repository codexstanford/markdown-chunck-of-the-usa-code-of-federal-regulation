####### Example 2.

(ii)CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC is incorporated and operating in Country Y and has a branch in Country Z. CFC has two QBUs (QBU Y and QBU Z). In Year 1, CFC earns $65x of gross royalty income that is passive income in Country Y through QBU Y and $65x of gross royalty income that is passive income in Country Z through QBU Z. CFC allocates $15x of expenses to the gross royalty income earned by each QBU, resulting in pre-tax passive income of $50x in each QBU. Country Y imposes $5x of foreign tax on the royalty income earned in Y, and Country Z imposes $10x of tax on royalty income earned in Z. All of CFC's income constitutes foreign personal holding company income that is passive income and is included under section 951(a)(1) in USP's gross income for the taxable year. USP allocates $50x of expenses pro rata to the $100x section 951(a)(1) inclusion attributable to the QBUs (consisting of the $45x section 951(a)(1) inclusion derived through QBU Y, the $5x section 78 amount attributable to QBU Y, the $40x section 951(a)(1) inclusion derived through QBU Z, and the $10x section 78 amount attributable to QBU Z), resulting in net passive income of $50x. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the high-tax kickout rules must be applied separately to the subpart F inclusion attributable to the income earned by QBU Y and the income earned by QBU Z. After application of the high-tax kickout rules, the $25x of net passive income attributable to QBU Y will be treated as passive category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income do not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $25x of net passive income ($5x < $5.25x (21% x $25x)). The $25x of net passive income attributable to QBU Z will be treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $25x of net passive income ($10x > $5.25x (21% x $25x)).
