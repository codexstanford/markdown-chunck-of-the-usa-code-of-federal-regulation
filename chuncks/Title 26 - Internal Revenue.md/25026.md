####### Special rule for convertible securities,General rule.

(e)-(1)For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if an obligation contains a right whereby the holder of such obligation may convert it directly or indirectly into another obligation which would be treated as a payment under paragraph (b) of this section or may convert it directly or indirectly into stock which would be treated as readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market under paragraph (d) of this section, the convertible obligation shall be considered to be in a form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market unless such obligation is convertible only at a substantial discount. In determining whether the stock or obligation, into which an obligation is convertible, is readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market, the rules stated in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply, and for purposes of such paragraph (d) if such obligation is convertible into stock then the term "stock" shall be substituted for the term "obligation" wherever it appears in such paragraph (d).
