####### Analysis.

(ii)Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the $100x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2 is reduced for limitation purposes to the extent of the $50x interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 before application of the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 is disregarded. CFC1 is treated as if it paid $50x of interest to CFC2, all of which is allocable to CFC1's passive category foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the $50x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2 is passive category income.
