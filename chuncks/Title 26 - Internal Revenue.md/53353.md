###### ยง 1.1502-50 Consolidated section 250.
####### Allocation of reduction.

(B)Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII is reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount as the consolidated FDII bears to the sum of the consolidated FDII and consolidated GILTI, and the P group's consolidated GILTI is reduced by the excess of the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount over the reduction described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, for purposes of determining the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount and consolidated GILTI deduction amount, its consolidated FDII is reduced to $221.54x ($240x -($25x x ($240x/$325x))) and its consolidated GILTI is reduced to $78.46x ($85x -($25x -($25x x ($240x/$325x)))).
