####### ATI.

(iii)Under section ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(1), to determine ATI, D must add business interest expense to tentative taxable income, but only to the extent that the business interest expense reduced tentative taxable income, or $200x. The $200x of business interest expense that was tentatively disallowed under section 469 is not added to tentative taxable income to determine ATI. D's ATI is $200x, which is determined by adding the $200x of business interest expense that reduced tentative taxable income to D's tentative taxable income, or $0 (0 + $200x).
