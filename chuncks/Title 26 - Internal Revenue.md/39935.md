###### ยง 1.937-2 Income from sources within a possession.
####### In general.,domestic

(b)Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section, the principles of sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions (relating to the determination of the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without the United States) generally will be applied in determining the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without the relevant possession. In the application of such principles, it generally will be sufficient to substitute, where appropriate, the name of the relevant possession for the term "United States," and to substitute, where appropriate, the term "bona fide resident of" followed by the name of the relevant possession for the term "United States resident." Furthermore, the termwill be construed to mean created or organized in the relevant possession. In applying these principles, additional substitutions may be necessary to accomplish the intent of section 937(b) and this section. For example, in applying the principles of sections 863(d) and (e) to individuals under this paragraph (b), the term "bona fide resident of a possession" will be used instead of the term "United States person." In no case, however, will a bona fide resident or other person have, as a result of the application of these principles, more income from sources within the relevant possession than the amount of income from sources within the United States that a similarly situated U.S. person who is not a bona fide resident would have under sections 861 through 865.
