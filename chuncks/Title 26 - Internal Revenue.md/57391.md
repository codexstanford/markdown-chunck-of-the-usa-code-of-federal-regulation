####### Manner of soliciting TIN.

(iii)A payee must request the payor's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the payor that the law requires the payor to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the payee. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, "Request for Student's or Borrower's Social Security Number and Certification," satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(iii). A payee may establish a system for payors to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. A payee may also develop a separate form to request the payor's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the payee, such as loan applications.
