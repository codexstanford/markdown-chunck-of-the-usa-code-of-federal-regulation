##### Real Estate Investment Trusts
###### ยง 1.856-5 Interest.
####### Where amount depends on income or profits of any person.

(b)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to an obligation is not includable as interest for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B) if, under the principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(3) and (6)(i) of ยง 1.856-4, the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (whether or not derived from property secured by the obligation). Thus, for example, if in accordance with a loan agreement an amount is received or accrued by the trust with respect to an obligation which includes both a fixed amount of interest and a percentage of the borrower's income or profits, neither the fixed interest nor the amount based upon the percentage will qualify as interest for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B). This paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section apply only to amounts received or accrued in taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, pursuant to loans made after May 27, 1976. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a loan is considered to be made before May 28, 1976, if it is made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into before May 28, 1976.
