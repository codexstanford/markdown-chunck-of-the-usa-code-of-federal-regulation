####### Timing rules when disqualified basis gives rise to a deferred or disallowed loss.

(C)To the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is deferred, then the determination of whether the item of deduction or loss gives rise to a basis benefit amount under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is made when the item of deduction or loss is no longer deferred. In addition, to the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is disallowed under section 267(a)(1), then a basis benefit amount is treated as occurring in the taxable year when and to the extent that gain is reduced pursuant to section 267(d), and provided that the gain is described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section.
