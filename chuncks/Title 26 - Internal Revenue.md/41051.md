##### controlled foreign corporations
###### ยง 1.955A-2 Amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations.
####### Coordination of provisions.

(2)No amount shall be counted as a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations under more than one provision of this section. Thus, for example, if a $10,000 investment in stock of a controlled foreign corporation is treated as a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations under both subparagraphs (1)(iii) and (v) of this paragraph, then such $10,000 is counted only once as a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations.
