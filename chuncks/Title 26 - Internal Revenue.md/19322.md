###### ยง 1.385-4 Treatment of consolidated groups.
####### Analysis.

(B)UST is acquiring the stock of DS3, the non-common parent member of a consolidated group. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the transaction is first analyzed without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and therefore UST is treated as issuing a covered debt instrument in exchange for expanded group stock. The exchange of UST Note for DS3 stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of ยง 1.385-3(g)(11) because UST and USS1 are not parties to an asset reorganization. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, ยง 1.385-3 (including ยง 1.385-3(b)(2)(ii)) is then applied to the transaction, thereby treating UST Note as stock for Federal tax purposes when it is issued by UST to USS1. The UST Note is not treated as property for purposes of section 304(a) because it is not property within the meaning specified in section 317(a). Therefore, UST's acquisition of DS3 stock from USS1 in exchange for UST Note is not an acquisition described in section 304(a)(1).
