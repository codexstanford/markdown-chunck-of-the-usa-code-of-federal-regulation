###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### T owns multiple assets.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, except that, in addition to Equipment #6, T also owns Asset A (depreciable real estate that is not eligible property). With respect to Equipment #6, the results are the same as in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section. However, the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule does not apply to Asset A because it is not eligible property. Accordingly, New T is not treated as transferring Asset A to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019 and then, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property for Asset A. If Equipment #6 had ceased to be eligible property as of June 1, 2019, the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule also would not apply to Equipment #6.
