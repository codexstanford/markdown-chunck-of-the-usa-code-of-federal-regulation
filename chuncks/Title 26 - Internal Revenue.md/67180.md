###### ยง 48.6420-2 Time for filing claim for credit or payment.
####### In general.

(a)A claim for credit or payment described in ยง 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline used after June 30, 1965, on a farm for farming purposes, shall cover only gasoline used during the taxable year on a farm for farming purposes. Therefore, gasoline on hand at the end of a taxable year as, for example, in fuel supply tanks of farm machinery or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for that taxable year (but may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year if used during that later year on a farm for farming purposes). Gasoline used during a taxable year may be covered by a claim filed for that taxable year although the gasoline was not paid for at the time the claim is filed. For purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in ยง 48.6420-1 (c) is considered to have as its taxable year, the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see paragraph (h) of this section.
