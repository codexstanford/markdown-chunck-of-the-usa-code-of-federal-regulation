() The rules of paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B)() of this section are illustrated by the following examples. Each example illustrates a payment that is not a withholdable payment and, as a result of which, neither the chapter 4 status of the NQI nor payee specific documentation with respect to the chapter 4 status is required to be provided to the withholding agent (and no withholding applies under chapter 4 on each payment). See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C) of this section for the requirements of a withholding statement provided by a nonqualified intermediary that receives a withholdable payment and for an example illustrating the requirements of an NQI providing a withholding statement to a withholding agent for a withholdable payment.
