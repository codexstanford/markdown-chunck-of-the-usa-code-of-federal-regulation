####### Example 2.

(ii)Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that in 2019, X physically modified CC3 to enable CC3 to capture 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The physical modification to upgrade CC3 does not satisfy the 80/20 Rule in ยง 1.45Q-2(g)(5). In 2020 X enters into a binding written contract with Z to provide 80,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for Z to dispose of in secure geological storage. X operates CC3 to capture carbon dioxide pursuant to the binding written contract with Z. Because the physical modification to upgrade CC3 does not satisfy the 80/20 Rule, the physical modification to upgrade CC3 is considered the installation of additional carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, rather than new carbon capture equipment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. As a result, any section 45Q credits attributable to the first 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z are calculated under section 45Q(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and are subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section. Any section 45Q credits attributable to additional carbon dioxide captured by CC3 and disposed of by Z in excess of those first 50,000 metric tons are calculated under section 45Q(a)(4) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and are not subject to the 75,000,000 metric ton limitation described in section 45Q(g) and paragraph (f) of this section.
