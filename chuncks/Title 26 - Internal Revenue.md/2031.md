####### Income distribution.

(iii)Income paid with respect to employer securities acquired by a TRASOP may be distributed at any time after receipt by the plan to participants on whose behalf such securities have been allocated without adversely affecting the qualified status of the plan under section 401(a). (See the last sentence of section 803(h), Tax Reform Act of 1976.) However, under a TRASOP that is a stock bonus or profit-sharing plan, income held by the plan for a 2-year period or longer must be distributed under rules generally applicable to stock bonus and profit-sharing plans qualified under section 401(a). Income distributed by a TRASOP is not subject to the partial exclusion of dividends provided in section 116, whether or not the income is held by the plan for two or more years.
