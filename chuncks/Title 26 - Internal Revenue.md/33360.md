(a)-(1)In order to compute the operations loss deduction of a life insurance company the company must first determine the part of any losses from operations for any preceding or succeeding taxable years which are carryovers or carrybacks to the taxable year in issue. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, a loss from operations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954, shall be carried back to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year. Except as limited by section 812(e)(2) and paragraph (b) of ยง 1.812-6, if the life insurance company is a new company (as defined in section 812(e)(1)) for the loss year, the loss from operations shall be carried back to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years succeeding the loss year. In determining the span of years for which a loss from operations may be carried, taxable years in which a company does not qualify as a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)), or is not treated as a new company, shall be taken into account.
