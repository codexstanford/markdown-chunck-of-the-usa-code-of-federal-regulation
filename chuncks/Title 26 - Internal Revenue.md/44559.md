####### Example 4: S corporation, Passthrough Interest, Indirect API, and Passthrough Taxpayer.

(iv)A owns all of the stock of S Corp, an S corporation. S Corp is engaged in an ATB, as defined in ยง 1.1061-1(a). S Corp is the general partner of PRS, a partnership, and provides substantial management services to PRS. A provides substantial services in S Corp's ATB. In connection with S Corp providing substantial services to PRS, PRS issues a profits interest to S Corp. S Corp's interest in PRS is its only asset. Because S Corp's profits interest in PRS was issued to S Corp in connection with substantial services in an ATB, S Corp is a Passthrough Taxpayer and its interest in PRS is an API. Because A is a shareholder in S Corp, A holds a Passthrough Interest in S Corp and an Indirect API in PRS as a result of S Corp's API in PRS. A is treated as an Owner Taxpayer because A holds an interest in S Corp, a Passthrough Taxpayer, and also indirectly holds an API in PRS in connection with A's services in S Corp's ATB.
