####### residual condition provision

(13) Ameans a provision in a rental agreement that requires a payment to be made by either the lessor or the lessee to the other party based on the difference between the actual condition of the property subject to the agreement, determined as of the expiration of the lease term, and the expected condition of the property at the expiration of the lease term, as set forth in the rental agreement. The amount of any such payment may be determined by reference to any objective measure relating to the use or condition of the property, such as miles, hours or other duration of use, units of production, or similar measure. A provision will be treated as a residual condition provision only if the payment represents compensation for the use of, or wear and tear on, the property in excess of, or below, a standard set forth in the rental agreement, and the standard is reasonably expected, as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as or later than the lease date, as of the agreement date), to be met at the expiration of the lease term.
