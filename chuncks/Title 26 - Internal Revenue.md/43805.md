(B)The parties have modified the terms of the debt instrument to replace a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR (six-month USD LIBOR plus 100 basis points) with a qualified rate (six-month CME Term SOFR plus 100 basis points) and have added an obligation for B to make the basis adjustment payment, which is a single cash payment that is intended to compensate L for the basis difference between the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (six-month USD LIBOR) and the interest rate benchmark to which the qualified rate refers (six-month CME Term SOFR). Accordingly, the basis adjustment payment is a qualified one-time payment as defined in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment payment is described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. Because it is described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section and not described in any of paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section, the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment payment is a covered modification of the debt instrument.
