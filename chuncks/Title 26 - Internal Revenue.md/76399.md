###### ยง 301.7701(i)-2 Special rules for portions of entities.
####### Portion defined.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and ยง 301.7701(i)-1, a portion of an entity includes all assets that support one or more of the same issues of debt obligations. For this purpose, an asset supports a debt obligation if, under the terms of the debt obligation (or underlying arrangement), the timing and amount of payments on the debt obligation are in large part determined, either directly or indirectly, by the timing and amount of payments or projected payments on the asset or a group of assets that includes the asset. Indirect payment arrangements include, for example, a swap or other hedge, or arrangements where the timing and amount of payments on the debt obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets (or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment experience similar to that of the assets. For purposes of this paragraph, the term payments includes all proceeds and receipts from an asset.
