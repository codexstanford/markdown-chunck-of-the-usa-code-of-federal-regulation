()Taxpayer F, a sole proprietor, and Taxpayer F's spouse travel from New York to Boston to attend a series of business meetings related to F's trade or business. F's spouse is not an employee of F, does not travel to Boston for a bona fide business purpose of F, and the expenses would not otherwise be deductible. While in Boston, F and F's spouse go out to dinner. Under section 274(m)(3) and paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the expenses associated with the food and beverages consumed by F's spouse are not deductible. Therefore, the cost of F's spouse's dinner is not deductible. F may deduct 50 percent of the expense associated with the food and beverages F consumed while on business travel if F meets the requirements in sections 162 and 274, including section 274(k) and (d).
