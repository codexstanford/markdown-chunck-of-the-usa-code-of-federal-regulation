######## Determination of the amount of accuracy-related penalty and fraud penalty,In general.

(2)-(i)The amount of any penalty under part II of subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Code (accuracy-related or fraud penalties) that relates to any partnership adjustment for the reviewed year is determined in accordance with this paragraph (c)(2). If in determining the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1 (or § 301.6225-2 in the case of modification), any grouping or subgrouping contains a negative adjustment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(ii)) and at least one positive adjustment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(iii)) that is subject to penalty, first apply the rules for allocating negative adjustments in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Then, apply the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to calculate penalty amounts. If there are no negative adjustments, do not apply the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and instead apply only the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. For all purposes under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adjustments that do not result in the imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)) and adjustments excluded from the determination of the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-2(b)(2) are disregarded.
