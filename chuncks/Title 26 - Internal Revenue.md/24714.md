####### Analysis for 2021.

(B)The $40x payment A receives in 2021 meets the definition of an advance payment under ยง 1.451-8(a)(1) as the full inclusion of $40x in gross income in the year of receipt is a permissible method of accounting, a portion of the payment ($35x) is "taken into account as AFS revenue" in a subsequent year, and the payment is for a good. Pursuant to ยง 1.451-8(a)(3), A's advance payment inventory inclusion amount for 2022 is $35x (the portion of the payment deferred for AFS purposes). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, A must first determine the AFS inventory inclusion amount for 2021 by applying the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section. A then reduces such amount by the cost of goods in progress offset for 2021, as determined under paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section.
