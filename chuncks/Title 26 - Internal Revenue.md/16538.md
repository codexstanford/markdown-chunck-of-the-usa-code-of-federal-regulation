####### Erroneous filing of deemed sale return.

(C)If, under this paragraph (a)(6)(ii), target files a deemed sale return but the selling group does not file a consolidated return, target must file a substituted return for old target not later than the due date (including extensions) for the return of the common parent with which old target would have been included in the consolidated return. The substituted return is for so much of old target's taxable year as ends at the close of the acquisition date. Under ยง 1.1502-76(c)(2), the deemed sale return is not considered a return for purposes of section 6011 (relating to the general requirement of filing a return) if a substituted return must be filed.
