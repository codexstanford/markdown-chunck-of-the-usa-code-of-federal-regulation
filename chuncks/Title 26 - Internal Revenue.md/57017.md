####### Mortgage,In general.

(2)-(i)Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an obligation is a mortgage if real property (regardless of where located) secures all or part of the obligation. An interest recipient must determine whether real property secures an obligation at the time the obligation is created or, if security is added or removed at a later time, at that later time. Real property includes a manufactured home as defined in section 25(e)(10). An obligation includes a line of credit or a credit card obligation. For purposes of this section and ยง 1.6050H-2, a borrower incurs a line of credit or credit card obligation when the borrower first has the right to borrow against the line of credit or credit card, whether the borrower actually borrows an amount at that time. An obligation will not fail to be treated as a mortgage solely because, under an applicable State or local homestead law or other debtor protection law in effect on August 16, 1986, the security interest is ineffective or the enforceability of the security interest is restricted.
