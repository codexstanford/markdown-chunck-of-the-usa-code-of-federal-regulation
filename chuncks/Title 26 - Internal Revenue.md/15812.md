####### Time of inclusion in gross income and time of determination of fair market value.

(c)A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders is included in the gross income of the distributees when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly made subject to their demands, without regard to whether such date is the same as that on which the corporation made the distribution. For example, if a corporation distributes a taxable dividend in property on December 30, 2021, that is received by, or unqualifiedly made subject to the demands of, its shareholders on January 3, 2022, the amount to be included in the gross income of the shareholders will be the fair market value of such property on December 30, 2021, determined under paragraph (b) of this section, although such amount will not be includible in the gross income of the shareholders until January 3, 2022.
