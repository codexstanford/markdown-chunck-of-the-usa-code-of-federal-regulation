####### Analysis.

(B)Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, any investment income or investment expense that a partnership receives, pays, or accrues and that is treated as properly allocable to a trade or business of a C corporation partner is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business of the C corporation partner. Because PRS generates its income and expense from investment activity that is not a trade or business under section 162 or a real property trade or business under section 469, U's allocation of $80x of income and $9x of deductible expense from PRS is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business.
