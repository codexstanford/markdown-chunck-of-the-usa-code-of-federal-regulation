() Derived by such person from finance charges connected with the financing of such sale, which is held in a reserve account by such financial institution for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customer, or both. Thus, the term includes amounts held in a reserve account by a financial institution in transactions in which the customer becomes obligated to the institution as well as such amounts so held by a financial institution in transactions in which the taxpayer is the obligee on the contract, note, or other evidence of indebtedness. For purposes of the definition of the term "dealer reserve income" it is immaterial whether or not the taxpayer guarantees the customer's obligation in excess of the reserve retained by the financial institution. The term does not include the consideration derived from transactions relating to the sale of intangible property such as stocks, bonds, copyrights, patents, etc. Further, the term does not include consideration derived by the taxpayer from transactions relating to the sale of property by a person not the taxpayer or to casual sales of property not in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
