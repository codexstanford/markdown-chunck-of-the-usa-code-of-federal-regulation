####### Carryover allocations,In general.

(a)-(1)A carryover allocation is an allocation that meets the requirements of section 42(h)(1)(E) or (F). If the requirements of section ยง 42(h)(1)(E) or (F) that are required to be satisfied by the close of a calendar year are not satisfied, the allocation is not valid and is treated as if it had not been made for that calendar year. For example, if a carryover allocation fails to satisfy a requirement in ยง 1.42-6(d) for making an allocation, such as failing to be signed or dated by an authorized official of an allocating agency by the close of a calendar year, the allocation is not valid and is treated as if it had not been made for that calendar year.
