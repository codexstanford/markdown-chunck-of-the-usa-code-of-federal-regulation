####### Property held primarily for sale to customers.

(2)For the purposes of section 856(e)(4)(C), foreclosure property held by the trust primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is considered to be property used in a trade or business conducted by the trust. Thus, if a trust holds foreclosure property (whether real property or personal property incident to real property) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business more than 90 days after the day on which the trust acquired the real property, the trade or business of selling the property must be conducted by the trust through an independent contractor from whom the trust does not derive or receive any income. Otherwise, after such 90th day the property will cease to be foreclosure property.
