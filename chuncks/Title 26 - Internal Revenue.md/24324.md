####### Other nonperiodic swap payments.,Example 6

(B)Nonperiodic payments on a swap other than an upfront payment may be amortized by treating the contract as if it provided for a single upfront payment (equal to the present value of the nonperiodic payments) and a loan between the parties. The discount rate (or rates) used in determining the deemed upfront payment and the time value component of the deemed loan is the same as the rate (or rates) used in the level payment method. The single upfront payment is then amortized under the level payment method described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The time value component of the loan is not treated as interest, but, together with the amortized amount of the deemed upfront payment, is recognized as a periodic payment. See paragraph (f)(4)of this section. If both parties make nonperiodic payments, this calculation is done separately for the nonperiodic payments made by each party.
