(3)-(i)Livestock qualifying as "section 38 property" under ยง 1.48-1(l) constitutes livestock for purposes of this section. Thus, for example, horses are not livestock for purposes of this section since they do not qualify as "section 38 property" under ยง 1.48-1(l). Under section 48(p)(6) poultry constitutes livestock for purposes of section 48(a)(1)(D). The term "livestock" includes the offspring of livestock. "Livestock" is distinguished from the produce of livestock, such as milk and eggs held for sale. For purposes of this section, eggs held for hatching and newborn livestock are considered livestock. A structure used solely to house produce of livestock or equipment necessary to house produce of livestock will not qualify as a single purpose agricultural structure. Thus, for example, a dairy facility used solely for storing milk will not qualify.
