####### Determination of costs of local advertising.

(4)Where an advertisement identifies more than one article, and all such articles are not taxable, or are not taxable at the same rate under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code, a reasonable allocation of the cost of the advertisement must be made among (i) articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code and (ii) articles which are not taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code. For example, in the case of a single page newspaper or magazine advertisement, an allocation of costs reflecting the lineage or space devoted to the specified categories will be considered to reflect a reasonable allocation of the cost of advertising the different articles. As a general rule, only the cost of the "spot" portion identifying the retail establishment is considered "local advertising" in the case of national television or radio programs.
