### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses
###### ยง 1.1251-2 Excess deductions account.
####### Certain operating rules.

(iii)For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the operating rules of section 381(b) and ยง 1.381(b)-1 shall apply. Thus, for example, except in the case of a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F) (whether or not such reorganization also qualifies under any other provision of section 368(a)(1)), the amount of the excess deductions account of the transferor shall be computed, as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer (as determined under paragraph (b) of ยง 1.381(b)-1), as if the taxable year of the transferor closed on such date (regardless of whether the taxable year actually closed). In the case of a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F) (whether or not such reorganization also qualifies under any other provision of section 368(a)(1)), the acquiring corporation's excess deductions account shall be treated for purposes of section 1251 just as the transferor corporation's excess deductions account would have been treated if there had been no reorganization.
