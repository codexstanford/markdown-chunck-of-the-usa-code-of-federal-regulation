####### Carryovers.

(v)The portion of the life consolidated net operating loss that is not absorbed in a prior year as a carryback, or as a life subgroup loss that set off nonlife consolidated taxable income for the year the loss arose, constitutes a life carryover under this paragraph (g)(2) to reduce consolidated LICTI before that portion may constitute a life subgroup loss that sets off nonlife consolidated taxable income for that particular year. For limitations on the use of life carryovers to offset nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated LICTI, see ยง 1.1502-21(b).
