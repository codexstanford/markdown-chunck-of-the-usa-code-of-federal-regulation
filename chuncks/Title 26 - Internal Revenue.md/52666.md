###### ยง 1.1502-21 Net operating losses.
####### Application to other than loss carryovers.

(ix)Paragraph (g) of this section and the phrase "or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or ยง 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)" in this paragraph (c)(2) apply only to carryovers of net operating losses, net capital losses, and for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, to carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2). Accordingly, as the context may require, if another regulation references this section and such other regulation does not concern a carryover of net operating losses, net capital losses, or for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2), then such reference does not include a reference to such paragraph or phrase.
