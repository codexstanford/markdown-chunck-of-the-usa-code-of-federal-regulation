####### Depreciation capitalized to inventory.

(C)Because all of the depreciation with respect to the warehouse is capitalized to inventory, FS's dual use ratio with respect to the warehouse is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to the warehouse that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, FS's dual use ratio with respect to the warehouse for Year 1 is 80%, which is FS's depreciation with respect to the warehouse that is capitalized to inventory of Product A, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining in FS's tested income for Year 1 ($1,200x), divided by FS's depreciation with respect to the warehouse that is capitalized to inventory of Product A, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining FS's income for Year 1 ($1,500x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $16,000x ($20,000x x 0.8) of FS's average adjusted basis in the warehouse is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining FS's qualified business asset investment for Year 1.
