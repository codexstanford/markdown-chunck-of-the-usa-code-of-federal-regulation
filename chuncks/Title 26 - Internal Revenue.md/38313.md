() Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the non-interest expenses that are not definitely related are apportioned on the basis of the asset values reduced by the allocated related person debt. Therefore, $10x of these expenses are apportioned to the passive category ($50x x ($2,000x - $1,500x)/($4,000x - $1,500x)) and $40x are apportioned to the general category ($50x x $2,000x/($4,000x - $1,500x)).
