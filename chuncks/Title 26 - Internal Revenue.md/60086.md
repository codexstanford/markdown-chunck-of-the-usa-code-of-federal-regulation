###### Hardship rules.

(2)A hardship distribution under this paragraph (d) has the same meaning as a distribution on account of hardship under ยง 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) and is subject to the rules and restrictions set forth in ยง 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) (including limiting the amount of a distribution in the case of hardship to the amount necessary to satisfy the hardship). In addition, a hardship distribution is limited to the aggregate dollar amount of the participant's section 403(b) elective deferrals under the contract (and may not include any income thereon), reduced by the aggregate dollar amount of the distributions previously made to the participant from the contract.
