####### Transactions entered into as part of a plan to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254.

(ii)In the case of a contribution of property prior to a sale or exchange of stock pursuant to a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply. Instead, the amount recognized as ordinary income under section 1254 is the amount of ordinary income the selling or exchanging shareholder would have recognized under section 1254 (with respect to the shares sold or exchanged) had the S corporation sold its natural resource recapture property the disposition of which would have resulted in the recognition of ordinary income under section 1254. The amount recognized as ordinary income under the preceding sentence reduces the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the stock.

This reduced amount realized is used in determining any gain or loss on the sale or exchange.
