####### Analysis.

(B)The year 4 transfer by TFD of all its assets to FA and the exchange by TFC of its TFD stock for FA voting stock pursuant to the reorganization constitute triggering events under paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(1) of this section, respectively. However, under paragraph (k)(6)(iii) of this section, the transfers shall not constitute triggering events if UST enters into a new gain recognition agreement with respect to the initial transfer that designates FA as the transferred corporation. In addition, under paragraph (k)(6)(iii) of this section only the assets of TFD acquired by FA in the asset reorganization shall be treated as assets of the transferred corporation for purposes of the new gain recognition agreement.
