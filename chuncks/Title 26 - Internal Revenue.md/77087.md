(2)Where such individual is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate a total of 183 days during a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1951, any compensation received by him (irrespective of when received, if received in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1951) for such labor or personal services performed in the United States during such year shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from United States tax if such compensation does not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate. Thus, if a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Switzerland performs personal services in the United States during the taxable year as an employee of a domestic corporation for which he receives compensation of $15,000 in the aggregate, none of such compensation shall be exempt from United States tax even though such individual is present in the United States during such year for a period or periods not exceeding a total of 183 days, since the aggregate compensation received is in excess of $10,000.
