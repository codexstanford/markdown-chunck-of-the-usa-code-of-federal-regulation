####### Effect of the non-member QOF C corporation election.

(B)As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(iii), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated as not being a member of the consolidated group from day one. Consequently, the consolidated group must file amended or superseding returns, as applicable, to exclude all of the pre-existing QOF sub's income, gain, deduction, and loss from the consolidated returns; the pre-existing QOF sub also must file its own returns for taxable periods beginning on day one, as applicable. In addition, all adjustments resulting from the pre-existing QOF sub's operations must be eliminated from the consolidated group, including investment adjustments made under ยง 1.1502-32 to basis in members' stock (as well as stock in the pre-existing QOF sub) and adjustments made under ยง 1.1502-33 to members' earnings and profits.
