#### PART 40 - EXCISE TAX PROCEDURAL REGULATIONS
##### ยง 40.6011(a)-2 Final returns.
###### Change in law without cessation of operations.

(2)Any person that is required under ยง 40.6011(a)-1 to make returns must make a final return in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form on which the return is made if, by reason of a change in law, that person is no longer liable for any tax (or, in the case of a collected tax, is no longer responsible for collecting and paying over any tax). For example, if the tax on a product is changed from a retail tax to a manufacturers tax, a retailer formerly liable for the tax but now buying the product tax-paid from its supplier must make a final return (assuming that the retailer has no other tax liability reportable on the return).
