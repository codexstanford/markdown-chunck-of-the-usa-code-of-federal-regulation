###### ยง 1.1502-47 Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
####### Subgroup rule.

(iv)In determining the portion of the life consolidated net operating loss that is absorbed when the loss is carried back to a consolidated return year, ยง 1.1502-21 is applied by treating the life subgroup as the group. Therefore, the absorption is determined without taking into account any nonlife subgroup losses that were previously reported on a consolidated return as setting off life consolidated taxable income for the year to which the life subgroup loss is carried back.
