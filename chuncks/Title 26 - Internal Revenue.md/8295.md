####### Partner-level computations.

(iv)X, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $135.60 of ATI ($100 from its sole proprietorship, plus $35.60 ATI from PRS) and $25 of business interest expense ($20 from its sole proprietorship, plus $5 of excess business interest expense treated as paid or accrued in Year 2). X's section 163(j) limit is $40.68 ($135.60 x 30 percent). Thus, $25 of X's business interest expense is deductible business interest expense. Y is not subject to section 163(j) under section 163(j)(3). As a result, Y's business interest expense is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation. Thus, all $45 of Y's business interest expense ($20 from its sole proprietorship, plus $20 disallowed from year 1, plus $5 of excess business interest expense treated as paid or accrued in Year 2) is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
