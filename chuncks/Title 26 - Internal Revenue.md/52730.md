()Because the P Group made a valid amended statute split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any taxable years of the X Group (that is, a former group). However, the amended statute split-waiver election does not prevent T's Year 7 amended carryback CNOL from being carried back to years of the P group (that is, the acquiring group) during which T was a member. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)()() of this section. As a result, the entire amount of T's amended carryback CNOL is eligible to be carried back to taxable Year 6 of the P Group. Any remaining CNOL may then be carried over within the P Group. See ยง 1.1502-21(b)(1).
