###### ยง 1.863-7 Allocation of income attributable to certain notional principal contracts under section 863(a).
####### Scope,Introduction.

(a)-(1)This section provides rules relating to the source and, in certain cases, the character of notional principal contract income. However, this section does not apply to income from a section 988 transaction within the meaning of section 988 and the regulations thereunder, relating to the treatment of certain nonfunctional currency transactions. Further, this section does not apply to a dividend equivalent described in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder. Notional principal contract income is income attributable to a notional principal contract as defined in ยง 1.446-3(c). An agreement between a taxpayer and a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) of the taxpayer, or among qualified business units of the same taxpayer, is not a notional principal contract, because a taxpayer cannot enter into a contract with itself.
