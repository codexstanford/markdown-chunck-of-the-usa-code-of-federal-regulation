(c)When a taxpayer that claimed a section 45Q credit with respect to qualified carbon oxide stored at a secure storage site, operator of the secure storage site, or regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the site determines that the qualified carbon oxide that was disposed of in secure geological storage has leaked to the atmosphere, the taxpayer or the party with whom the taxpayer contracted to ensure the secure geological storage of the qualified carbon oxide must quantify the metric tons of qualified carbon oxide that has leaked to the atmosphere pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart RR or CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019. The quantity determined pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019 must be certified by a qualified independent engineer or geologist, including a statement that the quantity was determined in accordance with sound engineering principles in the same manner as required in ยง 1.45Q-3. The IRS will consider all available facts and circumstances, and may consult with the relevant regulatory agency with jurisdiction over such site, in verifying the amount of qualified carbon oxide that has leaked to the atmosphere. The verified amount is the leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide.
