####### Recapture of deduction where 39-week test is not met.

(3)Paragraph (3) of section 217(d) provides a special rule which applies in cases where a taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) prior to his satisfying the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2), and the 39-week test is not satisfied during the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the expenses were deducted. In such cases an amount equal to the expenses which were deducted must be included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the expenses were deducted. In the event the taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) for the taxable year, and subsequently files an amended return for such year on which he eliminates such deduction, such expenses will not be deemed to have been deducted for purposes of the recapture rule of the preceding sentence.
