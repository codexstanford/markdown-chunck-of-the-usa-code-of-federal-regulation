####### 3,Attribution of gross income.,2,ii,3

()Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the gross income attributable to FDE ($400x) is adjusted downward to the extent that the $500x disregarded payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income of FDE that is reflected on FDE's separate set of books and records. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)()() of this section, the $500x payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of FDE's adjusted disregarded gain ($300x) with respect to Asset A. The source and separate category of the gross income of FDE to which the payment is allocable is proportionate to the source and separate category of the gain recognized by FDE with respect to Asset A. Accordingly, $300x of the payment is allocable to foreign source income that would be foreign branch category income. Thus, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)() of this section, foreign source gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward by $300x (increasing foreign source general category income by $300x) and foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward by $300x (decreasing foreign source foreign branch category income by $300x) in Year 3.
