###### ยง 1.382-2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
####### Aggregation of the public shareholders.

(C)The public shareholders are aggregated and, under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, are treated as a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder without regard to whether such group, at any time during the testing period, owns five percent or more of the loss corporation. For this purpose, if the public group of any first tier entity indirectly owns less than five percent of the loss corporation on the testing date, and is thus not treated as a 5-percent shareholder, but is treated as part of the public group of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the ownership interest of that group is included in the public group of the loss corporation referred to in the preceding sentence.
