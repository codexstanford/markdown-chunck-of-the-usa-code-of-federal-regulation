####### Special rule for changes in the relative values of stock of different classes.

(10)(i) In the case of a corporation that has more than one class of stock outstanding, if the percentage of value held by the private foundation, its disqualified persons, or both, increases over a period of time solely as a result of changes in the relative values of the stock of different classes, then the foundation value level, the disqualified person value level, and the substituted combined value level, as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, shall be adjusted to reflect such increase. An increase in the percentage of value held shall not be considered to have occurred solely as a result of changes in the relative values of the stock of different classes if:

(A) There has been any increase during the period in the percentage of any class of stock held by the private foundation, its disqualified persons, or both, or

(B) There has been any issuance, redemption, or purchase by the issuing corporation of any stock during the period.
