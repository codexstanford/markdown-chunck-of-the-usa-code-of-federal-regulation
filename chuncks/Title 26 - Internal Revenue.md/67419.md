###### § 49.4261-3 Payments made within the United States.
####### Other transportation.

(b)In the case of transportation, other than that described in paragraph (a) of this section, for which payment is made in the United States, the taxes imposed by section 4261(a) and (b) apply with respect to the amount paid for that portion of such transportation by air which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part of uninterrupted international air transportation within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) of the Code and § 49.4262-3(c). Transportation that:

(1) Begins in the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends outside such area,

(2) Begins outside the United States or the 225-mile zone and ends inside such area, or

(3) Begins outside the United States and ends outside such area, is taxable only with respect to the portion of the transportation by air which is directly or indirectly from one port or station in the United States to another port or station in the United States, but only if such portion is not a part of "uninterrupted international air transportation" within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and § 49.4262-3(c). Thus, on a trip by air from Chicago to London, England, with a stopover at New York, for which payment is made in the United States, if the portion from Chicago to New York is not a part of "uninterrupted international air transportation" within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and § 49.4262-3(c), the taxes would apply to the part of the payment which is applicable to the transportation from Chicago to New York. However, if the portion from Chicago to New York is a part of "uninterrupted international air transportation" within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and § 49.4262-3(c), the taxes would not apply.
