###### ยง 1.1275-4 Contingent payment debt instruments.
####### Safe harbor for exchange listed debt instruments.

(E)If the debt instrument is exchange listed property (within the meaning of ยง 1.1273-2(f)(2) as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2011), it is reasonable for the holder to allocate any difference between the holder's basis and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument pro-rata to daily portions of interest (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) over the remaining term of the debt instrument. A pro-rata allocation is not reasonable, however, to the extent the holder's yield on the debt instrument, determined after taking into account the amounts allocated under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(E), is less than the applicable Federal rate for the instrument. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument is determined as if the purchase date were the issue date and the remaining term of the instrument were the term of the instrument.
