####### Analysis.

(B)USS1 Note B is a covered debt instrument that is issued by USS1 to FP, a member of the expanded group of which USS1 is a member, in a distribution. Accordingly, USS1 Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP on Date B in Year 2. Accordingly, USS1 is treated as distributing USS1 stock to its shareholder FP in a distribution that is subject to section 305. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, because the distribution of USS1 Note B is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the distribution of USS1 Note B is not treated as a distribution of property described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, USS1 Note A is not treated as funding the distribution of USS1 Note B for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
