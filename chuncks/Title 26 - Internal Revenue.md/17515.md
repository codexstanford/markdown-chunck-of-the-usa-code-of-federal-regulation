####### Payment and reporting of interest.

(v)Interest must be paid on any additional tax due with respect to gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Any interest due shall be determined based on the rates under section 6621 for the period between the date that was prescribed for filing the Federal income tax return of the U.S. transferor for the year of the initial transfer and the date on which the additional tax due is paid. If paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section applies, any interest due must be included with the payment of tax due with the Federal income tax return of the U.S. transferor for the taxable year during which the gain recognition event occurs (or should reduce the amount of any refund due to the U.S. transferor for such taxable year). A schedule entitled "Calculation of Section 367 Tax and Interest" that separately identifies and calculates any additional tax and interest due must be included with the Federal income tax return on which any interest due is reported.
