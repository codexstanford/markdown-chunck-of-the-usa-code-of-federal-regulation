(14) Ameans a provision in a rental agreement that may require the lessee to make one or more payments to the lessor in the event that the Federal, foreign, state, or local income tax consequences actually realized by a lessor from owning the property subject to the rental agreement and leasing it to the lessee differ from the consequences reasonably expected by the lessor, but only if the differences in such consequences result from a misrepresentation, act, or failure to act on the part of the lessee, or any other factor not within the control of the lessor or any related person.
