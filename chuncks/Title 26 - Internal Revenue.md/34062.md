####### Reasonable cause,In general.

(c)-(1)The failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs) will be considered due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if the real estate investment trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to satisfy the requirements. Such care and prudence must be exercised at the time each transaction is entered into by the trust. However, even if the trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in entering into a transaction, if the trust later determines that the transaction results in the receipt or accrual of nonqualified income and that the amounts of such nonqualified income, in the context of the trust's overall portfolio, reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the trust must use ordinary business care and prudence in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the transaction, dispose of property acquired or leased in the transaction, or alter other elements of its portfolio. In any case, failure to meet an income source requirement will be considered due to willful neglect and not due to reasonable cause if the failure is willful and the trust could have avoided such failure by taking actions not inconsistent with ordinary business care and prudence. For example, if the trust enters into a lease knowing that it will produce nonqualified income which reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the failure is due to willful neglect even if the trust has a legitimate business purpose for entering into the lease.
