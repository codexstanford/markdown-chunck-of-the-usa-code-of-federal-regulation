####### aggregate basis difference

(1) The termmeans, with respect to a foreign income tax and a foreign payor, the sum of the allocated basis differences and the allocated basis difference adjustments for a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor, plus any aggregate basis difference carryover from the immediately preceding U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor with respect to the foreign income tax and foreign payor, as adjusted under ยง 1.901(m)-6(c). For purposes of this definition, if foreign law imposes tax on the combined income (within the meaning of ยง 1.901-2(f)(3)(ii)) of two or more foreign payors, all foreign payors whose items of income, deduction, gain, or loss are included in the U.S. taxable income or earnings and profits of the section 901(m) payor are treated as a single foreign payor. Aggregate basis difference is determined with respect to each separate category.
