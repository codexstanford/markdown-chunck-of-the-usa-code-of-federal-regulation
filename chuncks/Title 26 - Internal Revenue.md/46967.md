####### Allocation of interest.

(iii)For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest that is received or accrued, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, from a related person is allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income in proportion to the ratio of the portion of the related person's non-passive gross income for its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient to the total amount of the related person's gross income for the taxable year. If the related person does not have gross income for the taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient, the interest is either allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income to the extent the related person's deduction for the interest would be allocable to non-passive income of the related person under the principles of §§ 1.861-9 through 1.861-13T, applied in a reasonable and consistent manner taking into account the general operation of the PFIC rules and the purpose of section 1297(b)(2)(C) or, alternatively, at the election of the tested foreign corporation is treated as allocated entirely to passive income.
