() If a controlled foreign corporation has positive post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, such earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income if the earnings would qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4) if the entire amount of post-1986 undistributed earnings were treated as a net item of income subject to the rules of ยง 1.954-1(d). If the high withholding tax interest earnings would not qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4), then the earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.
