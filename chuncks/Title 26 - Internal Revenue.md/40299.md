()CFC2's holding of Asset A as of each of the December 31, Year 1 tested quarter close and the March 31, Year 2 tested quarter close does not satisfy the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section because CFC1, the predecessor CFC, does not hold Asset A on a quarter close of CFC1 that occurs on the same date as the September 30, Year 1, quarter close of CFC2, the acquiring CFC, which is the last quarter close of CFC2 preceding the December 30, Year 1 acquisition of Asset A. In addition, because CFC2 held Asset A for less than 12 months (from December 31, Year 1, until April 10, Year 2), the presumption in paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(A) of this section applies such that CFC2 is presumed to have acquired Asset A temporarily with a principal purpose of increasing the deemed tangible income return of USP for the shareholder inclusion year, and the facts and circumstances do not clearly establish that CFC2 did not acquire Asset A with such a principal purpose. Because CFC2 holds Asset A as of December 31, Year 1, the tested quarter close, the adjusted basis in Asset A would be, without regard to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, taken into account for purposes of determining USP's deemed tangible income return for its Year 1 taxable year as of five quarter closes (CFC1's quarter closes on February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30, and CFC2's quarter close on December 31). If instead CFC1 had retained Asset A during the period CFC2 temporarily held the asset and had transferred Asset A directly to CFC3 on January 10, Year 2, the adjusted basis in Asset A would have been taken into account for purposes of determining USP's deemed tangible income return for its Year 1 taxable year as of only four quarter closes (CFC1's quarter closes on February 28, May 30, August 30, and November 30). Under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, because the adjusted basis in Asset A would (without regard to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section) be taken into account for only one additional quarter close of a tested income CFC of USP in determining USP's deemed tangible income return for Year 1 and Year 2, the adjusted basis in Asset A is disregarded for purposes of determining CFC's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property only as of December 31, Year 1, the first tested quarter close that follows the acquisition. Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis in Asset A is disregarded in determining CFC2's aggregate adjusted basis in specified tangible property as of December 31, Year 1.
