####### Property acquired subject to lien,Mortgages.,acquisition indebtedness,acquisition indebtedness

(b)-(1)Except as provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, whenever property is acquired subject to a mortgage, the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness secured by such mortgage is treated aswith respect to such property even though the organization did not assume or agree to pay such indebtedness. The preceding sentence applies whether property is acquired by purchase, gift, devise, bequest, or any other means. Thus, for example, assume that an exempt organization pays $50,000 for real property valued at $150,000 and subject to a $100,000 mortgage. The $100,000 of outstanding principal indebtedness isjust as though the organization had borrowed $100,000 to buy the property.
