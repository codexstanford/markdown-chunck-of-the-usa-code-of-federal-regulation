####### ยง 301.6057-1 Employee retirement benefit plans; identification of participant with deferred vested retirement benefit.
######## Information relating to deferred vested retirement benefit,Incomplete records.

(3)-(i)Section 6057(a) and paragraph (a)(4) of this section require the filing on schedule SSA of a description of the deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled. If the plan administrator of a plan to which more than one employer contributes maintains records of a participant's service covered by the plan which are incomplete as of the close of the plan year with respect to which the plan administrator files information relating to the participant on schedule SSA, the plan administrator may elect to file the information required by schedule SSA based only upon these incomplete records. The plan administrator is not required, for purposes of completing schedule SSA, to compile from sources other than such records a complete record of a participant's years of service covered by the plan. Similarly, if retirement benefits under the plan are determined by taking into account a participant's service with an employer which is not service covered by the plan, but the plan administrator maintains records only with respect to periods of service covered by the plan, the plan administrator may complete schedule SSA taking into account only the participant's period of service covered by the plan.
