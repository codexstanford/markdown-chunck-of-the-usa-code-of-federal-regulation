(2)If, 90 days before the date on which the return described in this paragraph is due, a piece of coal mine safety equipment has not been certified as permissible by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines, then the election may be made by a statement in an amended income tax return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. The statement and amended return in such case must be filed not later than 90 days after the date the equipment is certified as permissible by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines. Amended income tax returns or claims for credit or refund should also be filed at this time for other taxable years which are within the amortization period and which are subsequent to the taxable year for which the election is made.
