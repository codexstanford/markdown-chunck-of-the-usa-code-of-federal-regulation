###### ยง 1.1001-3 Modifications of debt instruments.
####### Modifications of different terms.

(4)Modifications of different terms of a debt instrument, none of which separately would be a significant modification under paragraphs (e) (2) through (6) of this section, do not collectively constitute a significant modification. For example, a change in yield that is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and a substitution of collateral that is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section do not together result in a significant modification. Although the significance of each modification is determined independently, in testing a particular modification it is assumed that all other simultaneous modifications have already occurred.
