####### Alternative facts.

(iii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, except that FScannot use the loss of DE1under Country X tax law without an election, and no such election is made. Pursuant to the exception in § 1.1503(d)-3(c)(2), there is no foreign use of the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to P's interest in DE1. In addition, P files a domestic use election with respect to the year 1 dual consolidated loss attributable to its interest in DE1and, at the beginning of year 3, P sells its interest in DE1to F, a Country Y entity that is a foreign corporation. The sale of the interest in DE1to F results in a foreign use triggering event pursuant to § 1.1503(d)-6(e)(1)(i) because, immediately after the sale, the loss attributable to the interest in DE1carries over under Country X law and, therefore, is available under U.S. tax principles to offset income of the owner of the interest in DE1which, in the hands of F, is not a separate unit. It is also a foreign use because the loss is available under U.S. tax principles to offset the income of F, a foreign corporation. See § 1.1503(d)-3(a)(1). Finally, the transfer is a triggering event pursuant to § 1.1503(d)-6(e)(1)(iv) and (v).
