####### Result.

(B)The year 5 disposition by TFC of substantially all of the assets received from TFD in the year 3 liquidation is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and therefore UST must recognize the gain subject to the gain recognition agreement. UST must report the gain recognized on an amended return for the taxable year during which the initial transfer occurred. UST must also pay applicable interest on any additional tax due with respect to the gain recognized. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of the TFC stock received by UST in the initial transfer is increased as of the date of the initial transfer by the amount of gain recognized under the gain recognition agreement. The basis of the assets of TFD, however, is not increased.
