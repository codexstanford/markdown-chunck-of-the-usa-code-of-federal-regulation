()The facts are the same as inin paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(I)() of this section, except that the partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect, and B recognizes a capital loss from its sale of the partnership interest to X on December 31 of Year 4. Because there is no difference between B's depreciation deductions from the partnership taken into account and the recomputed depreciation deductions, S does not take any of its gain into account during Years 1 through 4 as a result of B's partnership's items. Instead, S's entire intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's loss taken into account from the sale to X and the recomputed gain or loss.
