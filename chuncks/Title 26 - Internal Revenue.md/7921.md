(B)-()A is engaged in a manufacturing business and uses the calendar year as its annual accounting period. A does not use gold in its manufacturing business. In 2021, A expects to borrow $1,000x for six months. In January 2021, A borrows from B two ounces of gold at a time when the spot price for gold is $500x per ounce. A agrees to return the two ounces of gold in six months. A sells the two ounces of gold to C for $1,000x. A then enters into a contract with D to purchase two ounces of gold six months in the future for $1,013x. In exchange for the use of $1,000x in cash for six months, A has sustained a loss of $13x in connection with these related transactions. A would not have entered into the gold transactions in the ordinary course of A's trade or business.
