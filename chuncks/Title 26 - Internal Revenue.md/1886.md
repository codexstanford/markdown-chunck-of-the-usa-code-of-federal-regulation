###### ยง 1.46-5 Qualified progress expenditures.
####### Property partially self-constructed.

(2)If an item of property is non-self-constructed, but a taxpayer uses its own employees to construct a portion of the property, expenditures for construction of that portion are made directly by the taxpayer (see ยง 1.46-5(h)(1)). Subject to the limitations of paragraph (g) of this section, those expenditures are qualified progress expenditures for non-self-constructed property if they satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (j) (4), (5), and (6) of this section. Wages actually paid to the taxpayer's employees are presumed to correspond to progress in construction. Other amounts, including expenditures for materials, parts, and overhead, must be actually paid, not borrowed from the payee, and attributable to progress made in construction by the taxpayer.
