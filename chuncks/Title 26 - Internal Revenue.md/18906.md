###### ยง 1.382-9 Special rules under section 382 for corporations under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case.
####### Amended returns.

(C)If the retroactive application of this paragraph (d) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable year, then, except as precluded by the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation (or the common parent of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effects of the retroactive application of the rules of this paragraph (d). If the statute of limitations precludes the filing of an amended return for one or more such prior taxable years, the loss corporation (or the common parent) must make appropriate adjustments under the principles of section 382(l)(2)(A) in subsequent taxable years to reflect the difference between the losses and credits actually used in such prior taxable years and the amount that would have been used in those years applying the rules of this paragraph (d).
