###### § 1.905-1 When credit for foreign income taxes may be taken.
####### Analysis.

(B)Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the additional liability asserted by Country X with respect to U.S.C.'s Year 1 income does not accrue until the contest is resolved in Year 6. U.S.C.'s remittance of €40x of contested tax in Year 3 is not a payment of accrued tax, and so is not a foreign tax redetermination. Both the €40x of Country X taxes paid in Year 3 and the €10x of Country X taxes paid in Year 6 accrue in Year 6, when the contest is resolved. Once accrued and paid, the €50x relates back for foreign tax credit purposes to Year 1, and can be claimed as a credit by U.S.C. on a timely-filed amended return for Year 1. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a), for foreign tax credit purposes the €40x paid in Year 3 is translated into dollars at the average exchange rate for Year 1 (€40x x $1/€1 = $40x), and the €10x paid in Year 6 is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date paid (€10x x $1/€2 = $5x). Accordingly, after the €50x of Country X income tax is paid in Year 6 U.S.C. may claim an additional foreign tax credit of $45x for Year 1.
