###### ยง 1.901(m)-3 Disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover.
####### 2

() In determining aggregate basis difference under ยง 1.901(m)-1(a)(1) for a U.S. taxable year of CFC1, CFC1 has three computations with respect to Country F tax, because there are three foreign payors for Country F tax purposes whose foreign income tax amount, if any, is considered paid or accrued by CFC1 as the section 901(m) payor. Furthermore, for each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will compute a separate disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with respect to each foreign payor.
