####### Leasing rule.

(iii)For purposes of this subparagraph, leased property is deemed to be ultimately used by a member of the same controlled group as the lessor if such property is leased to a person which is not a member of such controlled group but which subleases such property to a person which is a member of such controlled group. Thus, for example, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a movie film to Y, a foreign corporation which is not a member of the same controlled group as X, and Y then subleases the film to persons which are members of such group for showing to the general public, the film is not export property. On the other hand, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a movie film to Z, a foreign corporation which is a member of the same controlled group as X, and Z then subleases the film to Y, another foreign corporation, which is not a member of the same controlled group for showing to the general public, the film is not disqualified under this subparagraph from being export property.
