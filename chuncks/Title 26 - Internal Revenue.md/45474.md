###### § 1.1248-1 Treatment of gain from certain sales or exchanges of stock in certain foreign corporations.
####### Gain recognized.

(c)Section 1248(a) applies to a sale or exchange of stock in a foreign corporation only if gain is recognized in whole or in part upon the sale or exchange. Thus, for example, if a United States person exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and no gain is recognized on the exchange under section 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361, taking into account the application of section 367, then no amount is includible in the gross income of the person as a dividend under section 1248(a). But see §§ 1.1248(f)-1 and 1.1248(f)-2, providing that a domestic distributing corporation must include in gross income amounts under section 1248(f) as a result of certain foreign stock distributed pursuant to section 337, 355(c)(1), or 361(c)(1) (in certain cases without regard to the amount of gain realized by the domestic distributing corporation in the distribution).
