##### ยง 400.4-1 Notice required with respect to a nonjudicial sale.
###### Postponement of scheduled sale-,Where notice of sale is given.

(2)(i)In the event that notice of a sale is given in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), with respect to a scheduled sale which is postponed to a later time or date, the seller of the property is required to give notice of the postponement to the district director in the same manner as is required under local law with respect to other secured creditors. For example, assume that in M State local law requires that in the event of a postponement of a scheduled foreclosure sale of real property, an oral announcement of the postponement at the place and time of the scheduled sale constitutes sufficient notice to secured creditors of the postponement. Accordingly, if at the place and time of a scheduled sale in M State an oral announcement of the postponement is made, the Internal Revenue Service is considered to have notice of the postponement for the purpose of this subparagraph.
