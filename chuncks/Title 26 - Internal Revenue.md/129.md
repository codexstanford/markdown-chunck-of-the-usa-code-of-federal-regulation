## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury

#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Changes in Rates During a Taxable Year
###### ยง 1.25-2T Amount of credit (Temporary).
####### Carryforward of unused credit.

(2)(i) If the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and ยง 1.25-2T for any taxable year exceeds the applicable tax limit for that year, the excess (the "unused credit") will be a carryover to each of the 3 succeeding taxable years and, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(2)(ii), will be added to the credit allowable by section 25 (a) and ยง 1.25-2T for that succeeding year.

(ii) The amount of the unused credit for any taxable year (the "unused credit year") which may be taken into account under this paragraph (d)(2) for any subsequent taxable year may not exceed the amount by which the applicable tax limit for that subsequent taxable year exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and ยง 1.25-1T for the current taxable year, and (B) the sum of the unused credits which, by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), are carried to that subsequent taxable year and are attributable to taxable years before the unused credit year. Thus, if by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), unused credits from 2 prior taxable years are carried forward to a subsequent taxable year, the unused credit from the earlier of those 2 prior years must be taken into account before the unused credit from the later of those 2 years is taken into account.

(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) the term "applicable tax limit" means the limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for the taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable for that year under section 21, relating to expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment, section 22, relating to the credit for the elderly and the permanently disabled, section 23, relating to the residential energy credit, and section 24, relating to contributions to candidates for public office. The limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for any taxable year is equal to the taxpayer's tax liability (as defined in section 26 (b)) for that year.

(iv) The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2):
