####### Election,Method of making election.

(b)-(1)The election must be made in the return filed by the company for the taxable year. The election shall be made by the taxpayer (the regulated investment company) by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which such election applies as a dividend paid during the taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income, or if the dividend (or portion thereof) to which such election applies is to be designated by the company as a capital gain dividend, in computing the amount of capital gain dividends paid during such taxable year. The election provided in section 855(a) may be made only to the extent that the earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed with the application of section 852(c) and ยง 1.852-5) exceed the total amount of distributions out of such earnings and profits actually made during the taxable year (not including distributions with respect to which an election has been made for a prior year under section 855(a)). The dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which the regulated investment company has made a valid election under section 855(a), shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year for which such election is made, and not out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made.
