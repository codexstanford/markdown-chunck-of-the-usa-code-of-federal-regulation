####### Three year QEF net capital gain adjustment.

(ii)For purposes of calculating an Owner Taxpayer's API Three Year Distributive Share Amount, the entire amount determined under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, after any allowed reduction, is included as an item in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section unless the QEF provides information to determine the amount of the inclusion that would constitute net capital gain (as defined in ยง 1.1293-1(a)(2), as limited by section 1293(e)(2)) if the QEF's net capital gain for the taxable year were calculated under section 1222(11) applying paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1222 by substituting three years for one year. If such information is provided, the amount included as an item in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is the amount determined under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section that would not be treated as long-term gain if three years were substituted for one year in paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1222. See ยง 1.1061-6 for reporting rules.
