###### ยง 1.1502-68 Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.
####### Analysis.

(ii)B's acquisition of Equipment #4 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. The Group Prior Use Rule does not apply to treat B as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #4 because B is a member of the X group and no member of the X group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 while a member of the X group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period. Assuming all other requirements in ยง 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
