() Any reasonable method may be used to attribute taxable income to USP's activities in state A. For example, the rules of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act ("UDITPA") attribute income to a state on the basis of the average of three ratios that are based upon the taxpayer's facts-property within the state over total property, payroll within the state over total payroll, and sales within the state over total sales-and, with adjustments, provide a reasonable method for this purpose. When applying the rules of UDITPA to estimate U.S. source income derived from state A activities, the taxpayer's UDITPA factors must be adjusted to eliminate both taxable income and factors attributable to a foreign branch. Therefore, in the example in this paragraph (g)(27) all taxable income as well as UDITPA apportionment factors (property, payroll, and sales) attributable to USP's Country Y branch must be eliminated.
