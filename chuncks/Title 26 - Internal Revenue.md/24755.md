####### Decrease to transaction price amount.

(ii)If the transaction price amount has been increased because a significant financing component is deemed to exist under the standards the taxpayer uses to prepare its AFS, the taxpayer must determine the specific performance obligation to which such amount relates and decrease the transaction price amount allocable to the corresponding item of gross income by such amount (specific identification approach). If it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to use the specific identification approach, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method to allocate such amount to the items of gross income in the contract. A pro-rata allocation of such amount across all items of gross income under the contract based on the relative transaction price amounts allocated to such items under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is a reasonable method.
