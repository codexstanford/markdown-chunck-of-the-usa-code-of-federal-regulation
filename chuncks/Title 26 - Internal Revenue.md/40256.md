()The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset D is $500x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $50x with respect to Asset D, $10x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product A and $40x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. None of the $10x depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $40x capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining FC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $5x ($10x x 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining FC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $15x ($30x x 0.5).
