####### b,Agreement as to assumed price.,a,Provided,,And, provided further,,a,a

()In the case of an investment unit which is privately placed, the assumed price at which the obligation would have been issued had it been issued apart from such unit may be agreed to by the issuer and the original purchaser of the investment unit in writing on or before the date of purchase. Alternatively, an agreement between the issuer and original purchaser may specify the rate of interest which would have been paid on the obligation if the transaction were one not involving the issuance of options, and an assumed issue price may be determined (in the manner described in () of this subdivision) from such agreed assumed rate of interest. An assumed price based upon such an agreement between the parties will generally be presumed to be the issue price of the obligation with respect to the issuer, original purchaser, and all subsequent holders:That the agreement was made in arm's length negotiations between parties having adverse interests:That such price does not, under the rules stated in () of this subdivision, appear to be clearly erroneous. An assumed issue price agreed to by the parties as provided herein will not be considered clearly erroneous if it is not less than the face value adjusted (in the manner described in () of this subdivision) to a yield which is one percentage point greater than the actual rate of interest payable on the obligation. Similarly, if the agreement between the parties specifies an agreed assumed rate of interest (in lieu of an agreed assumed issue price) and such agreed rate is not more than 1 percentage point greater than the actual rate payable on the obligation, an adjusted issue price based upon such agreed assumed rate of interest will not be considered clearly erroneous.
