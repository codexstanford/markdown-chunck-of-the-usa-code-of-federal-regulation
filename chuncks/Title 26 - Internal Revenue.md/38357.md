####### Example 2.,Example 1

(ii)The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in), except that instead of a $100x interest payment, CFC3 pays a $50x dividend to CFC2 in Year 1. USP and V each own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of both CFC2 and CFC3, and, therefore, CFC2 and CFC3 have the same United States shareholders. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, because CFC2 and CFC3 have a common United States shareholder, for purposes of applying this section to the dividend from CFC2 to CFC3, CFC2 and CFC3 are treated as related look-through entities. Therefore, look-through principles apply. Because CFC3 has no passive category income or earnings and profits, the dividend income is characterized as general category income to CFC2. The dividend is subpart F income of CFC2 that is taxable to USP and V. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the subpart F inclusions of USP and V are not passive category income to USP and V and therefore under ยง 1.904-4 the subpart F inclusions are general category income to USP and V.
