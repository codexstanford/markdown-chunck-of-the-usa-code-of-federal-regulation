####### Nonaccount balance plan providing right to discontinue future accrual of benefits.

(C)If under the terms of the nonaccount balance plan in effect as of November 2, 2017, the corporation has no right to terminate the plan, but may discontinue future accruals of benefits and distribute the benefit in accordance with the terms of the plan, then the grandfathered amount would be the lump sum value of the total benefit (lump sum value) determined as if the corporation had exercised the right to discontinue the future accrual of benefits on November 2, 2017, or, if later, the earliest permissible date the corporation could exercise such right in accordance with the terms of the plan (the freeze date). If, after the freeze date, the plan required the corporation to increase or decrease the lump sum value through the payment date, then any increase to the grandfathered lump sum would also be grandfathered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation may treat the lump sum value determined as of the freeze date as the grandfathered amount regardless of when the amount is paid and regardless of whether it has been increased or decreased prior to payment. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(C), the lump sum value is determined based on the actuarial methods and assumptions provided in the plan in effect on November 2, 2017, if the assumptions are reasonable, or any reasonable actuarial assumptions if the plan does not provide for applicable actuarial methods and assumptions or the terms of the plan were not reasonable. The determination of the lump sum value may not take into account the likelihood that payments will not be made (or will be reduced) because of the unfunded status of the plan, the risk that the employer, the trustee, or another party will be unwilling or unable to pay, the possibility of future plan amendments, the possibility of a future change in the law, or similar risks or contingencies. If the benefit paid under the plan in effect on November 2, 2017, is paid as a life annuity or other form of benefit that is not a single lump sum payment, the application of the grandfathered amount to the payments of the benefit is determined in accordance with the ordering rule of paragraph (g)(1)(viii) of this section.
