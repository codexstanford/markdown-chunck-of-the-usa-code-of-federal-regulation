######## Transfers of funds.

(f)The transfers of funds between the United States and Guam required to effectuate the provisions of this section shall be made when convenient for the two governments, but not less frequently than once in each calendar year. In complying with paragraph (b) of this section, only net balances will be transferred between the two governments. Further, amounts transferred pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may be determined on the basis of estimates rather than the actual amounts derived from information furnished by taxpayers, except that the net collections for 1973 and every third calendar year thereafter are to be transferred on the basis of the information furnished by taxpayers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In order to facilitate the transfer of funds pursuant to this section, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation of Guam shall exchange such information, including copies of income tax returns, as will ensure that the provisions of section 7654 and this section are being properly implemented.
