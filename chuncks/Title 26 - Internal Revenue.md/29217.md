(2)For purposes of this paragraph, liens similar to mortgages shall be treated as mortgages. A lien is similar to a mortgage if title to property is encumbered by the lien for the benefit of a creditor. However, in the case where State law provides that a tax lien attaches to property prior to the time when such lien becomes due and payable, such lien shall not be treated as similar to a mortgage until after it has become due and payable and the organization has had an opportunity to pay such lien in accordance with State law. Liens similar to mortgages include (but are not limited to):

(i) Deeds of trust,

(ii) Conditional sales contracts,

(iii) Chattel mortgages,

(iv) Security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code,

(v) Pledges,

(vi) Agreements to hold title in escrow, and

(vii) Tax liens (other than those described in the third sentence of this subparagraph).
