##### treatment of excess distributions of trusts applicable to taxable years beginning before january 1, 1969
###### ยง 1.668(b)-1A Tax on distribution.
####### Disallowance of short-cut method.

(d)If, in any prior taxable year of the beneficiary in which any part of the accumulation distribution of undistributed net income is deemed to have been distributed under section 666(a) to such beneficiary, any part of prior accumulation distributions of undistributed net income by each of two or more other trusts is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, then the short-cut method under paragraph (c) of this section may not be used and the partial tax imposed by section 668(a)(2) shall be computed only under the exact method under paragraph (b) of this section. For example, assume that, in 1978, trust X makes an accumulation distribution of undistributed net income to A, who is on the calendar year basis, and part of the accumulation distribution is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed on March 31, 1974. In 1977, A had received an accumulation distribution of undistributed net income from both trust Y and trust Z. Part of the accumulation distribution from trust Y was deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to A on June 30, 1974, and part of the accumulation distribution from trust Z was deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to A on December 31, 1974. Because there were portions of accumulation distributions of undistributed net income from two other trusts deemed distributed within the same prior taxable year of A (1974), the 1978 accumulation distribution from trust X may not be computed under the short-cut method provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore the exact method under paragraph (b) of this section must be used to compute the tax imposed by section 666(a)(2).
