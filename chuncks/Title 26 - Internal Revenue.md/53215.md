####### Example 2.

(ii)Since 2012, L1 has been a life company owning all the stock of L2. In 2018, L1 transfers assets to S1, a new nonlife insurance company subject to taxation under section 831(a). For 2020, only L1 and L2 are eligible corporations. The tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section does not apply in 2020 because the old corporation (L1) and the new corporation (S1) do not have the same tax character.
