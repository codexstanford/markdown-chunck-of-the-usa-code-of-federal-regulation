####### Overview.

(a)An individual engaged in a farming or fishing business may make a farm income averaging election to compute current year (election year) income tax liability under section 1 by averaging, over the prior three-year period (base years), all or a portion of the individual's current year electible farm income as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Electible farm income includes income from both farming and fishing businesses. An individual who makes a farm income averaging election-

(2) Determines the election year section 1 tax by calculating the sum of-

(i) The section 1 tax that would be imposed for the election year if taxable income for the year were reduced by elected farm income; plus

(ii) The amount by which the section 1 tax would be increased if taxable income for each base year were increased by one-third of elected farm income.
