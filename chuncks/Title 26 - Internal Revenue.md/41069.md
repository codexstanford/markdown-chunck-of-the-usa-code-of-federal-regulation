####### Excluded property.

(f)For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, property acquired principally for the purpose of artificially increasing the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations will not be recognized; whether an item of property is acquired principally for such purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the factors that will be considered in making such a determination with respect to an item of property is whether the item is disposed of within 6 months after the date of its acquisition.
