####### ยง 301.6225-1 Partnership adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.
######## Subgroupings for adjustments to CFTEs.

(B)Each adjustment to a CFTE is subgrouped based on the separate category of income to which the CFTE relates in accordance with section 904(d) and the regulations in part 1 of this chapter, and to account for any different allocation of the CFTE between partners. Two or more adjustments to CFTEs are included within the same subgrouping only if each adjustment relates to CFTEs in the same separate category, and each adjusted partnership-related item would be allocated to the partners in the same ratio had those items been properly reflected on the partnership return for the reviewed year.
