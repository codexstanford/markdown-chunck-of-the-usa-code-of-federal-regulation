() For purposes of determining each person's portion of the combined income, the treatment of a payment is determined under foreign law. Thus, for example, interest accrued by one group member with respect to an instrument held by another member that is treated as debt for foreign tax purposes but as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes would be considered income of the holder and would reduce the income of the issuer. See also ยง 1.909-2(b)(3)(i) for rules requiring suspension of foreign income taxes paid by the owner of a U.S. equity hybrid instrument.
