###### § 1.901(m)-4 Determination of basis difference.
####### Result.

(ii)Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(3), the acquisitions of the partnership interests in USPS by US1, US2, and FP each give rise to separate section 743(b) CAAs, but under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(3), they are treated as an aggregated CAA transaction because they occur as part of a plan. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), USPS is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to the assets of DE1 and DE2 that are RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), DE1 is a foreign payor for Country X tax purposes, and DE2 is a foreign payor for Country Y tax purposes. Because the RFA owner (U.S.) is a partnership, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that US1, US2, and FP (the relevant partners in USPS) separately choose whether to make a foreign basis election for purposes of determining basis difference. Furthermore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the choice to make the election is made separately by each partner with respect to each foreign payor. Thus, in this case, each partner may make separate elections for the RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE1 for Country X tax purposes and the RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE2 for Country Y tax purposes.
