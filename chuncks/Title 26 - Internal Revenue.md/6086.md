###### ยง 1.148-4 Yield on an issue of bonds.
####### Special aggregation rule treating certain bonds as a single fixed yield bond.

(5)Two variable yield bonds of an issue are treated in the aggregate as a single fixed yield bond if-

(i) Aggregate treatment would result in the single bond being a fixed yield bond; and

(ii) The terms of the bonds do not contain any features that could distort the aggregate fixed yield from what the yield would be if a single fixed yield bond were issued. For example, if an issue contains a bond bearing interest at a floating rate and a related bond bearing interest at a rate equal to a fixed rate minus that floating rate, those two bonds are treated as a single fixed yield bond only if neither bond may be redeemed unless the other bond is also redeemed at the same time.
