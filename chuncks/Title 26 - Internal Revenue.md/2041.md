####### Continued investment in employer securities.

(10)The requirement that a plan be designed to invest primarily in employer securities is a continuing obligation. Therefore, a transaction changing the status of a corporation as an employer may require the conversion of certain plan assets into other securities. See paragraphs (d)(9) and (g)(6) of this section. In general, cash or other assets derived from the disposition of employer securities must be reinvested in employer securities not later than the 90th day following the date of disposition. However, the Commissioner may grant an extension of the period for reinvestment in employer securities depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.
