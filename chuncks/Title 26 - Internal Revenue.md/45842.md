####### Step 1.

(2)The first step is to make the following computations:

(i) In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)), and the gain realized. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange or involuntary conversion, the gain realized shall be considered to be the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis.

(ii) In respect of each element as if it were a separate property, compute the additional depreciation for the element, and the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250(a)(2)) for the element. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in ยง 1.1250-4.
