####### Joint returns.

(b)(1) In the case of a husband and wife filing a joint return under section 6013, the tax on self-employment income is computed on the separate self-employment income of each spouse, and not on the aggregate of the two amounts. The requirement of section 6013(d)(3) that in the case of a joint return the tax is computed on the aggregate income of the spouses is not applicable with respect to the tax on self-employment income. Where the husband and wife each has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more, it will be necessary for each to complete separate schedules of the computation of self-employment tax with respect to the net earnings of each spouse, despite the fact that a joint return is filed. If the net earnings from self-employment of either the husband or the wife are less than $400, such net earnings are not subject to the tax on self-employment income, even though they must be shown on the joint return for purposes of the tax imposed by section 1 or 3.

(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, section 6013 is applicable to the return of the tax on self-employment income; therefore, the liability with respect to such tax in the case of a joint return is joint and several.
