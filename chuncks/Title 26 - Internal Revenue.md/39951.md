In the case of an individual who is not a possessions shareholder (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section), the preceding sentence will apply only if the corporation qualifies as a "United States-owned foreign corporation" for purposes of section 904(h); and

(2) In all other cases, the amount will be considered income from sources in the jurisdiction in which the corporation is created or organized.
