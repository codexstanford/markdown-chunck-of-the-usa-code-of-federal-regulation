####### Method of making election.

(2)(i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, any unincorporated organization described in subparagraphs (1) and either (2) or (3) of paragraph (a) of this section which wishes to be excluded from all of subchapter K must make the election provided in section 761(a) in a statement attached to, or incorporated in, a properly executed partnership return, Form 1065, which shall contain the information required in this subdivision. Such return shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom a partnership return, Form 1065, would be required to be filed if no election were made. Where, for the purpose of determining such officer, it is necessary to determine the internal revenue district (or service center serving such district) in which the electing organization has its principal office or place of business, the principal office or place of business of the person filing the return shall be considered the principal office or place of business of the organization. The partnership return must be filed not later than the time prescribed by paragraph (e) of ยง 1.6031-1 (including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return with respect to the first taxable year for which exclusion from subchapter K is desired. Such partnership return shall contain, in lieu of the information required by Form 1065 and by the instructions relating thereto, only the name or other identification and the address of the organization together with information on the return, or in the statement attached to the return, showing the names, addresses, and identification numbers of all the members of the organization; a statement that the organization qualifies under subparagraphs (1) and either (2) or (3) of paragraph (a) of this section; a statement that all of the members of the organization elect that it be excluded from all of subchapter K; and a statement indicating where a copy of the agreement under which the organization operates is available (or if the agreement is oral, from whom the provisions of the agreement may be obtained).

(ii) If an unincorporated organization described in subparagraphs (1) and either (2) or (3) of paragraph (a) of this section does not make the election provided in section 761(a) in the manner prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, it shall nevertheless be deemed to have made the election if it can be shown from all the surrounding facts and circumstances that it was the intention of the members of such organization at the time of its formation to secure exclusion from all of subchapter K beginning with the first taxable year of the organization. Although the following facts are not exclusive, either one of such facts may indicate the requisite intent:
