###### ยง 1.382-2T Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
####### ii

() If B, C and D, but not A, each exercise their respective rights to acquire an additional 85 shares of L stock (10 shares x 8.5 shares that may be acquired for each share owned) on July 12, 1988, their combined ownership interest in L on that date would exceed 80 percent (255 shares deemed to be acquired + 30 shares actually owned)/355 shares outstanding (actual and deemed)). B, C and D thus would increase their ownership interest in L by 50.3 percentage points during the testing period, causing an ownership change, because, under paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the options are treated as exercised if the exercise would cause an ownership change.
