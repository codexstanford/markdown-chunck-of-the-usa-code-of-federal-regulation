Section 48(g)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section define the term "qualified rehabilitation expenditure." Section 48(g) (2)(B)(iv) and (3) and paragraph (d) of this section describe the rules applicable to "certified historic structures."

Paragraph (f) of this section provides guidance for coordination of these provisions with other sections of the Code, including rules for determining when the rehabilitation credit may be claimed.
