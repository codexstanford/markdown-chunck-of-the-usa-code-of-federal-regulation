####### Limitation on contributions.

(2)Except as otherwise provided in ยง 1.468A-8 (relating to special transfers under section 468A(f)), a nuclear decommissioning fund is not permitted to accept any contributions in cash or property other than cash payments with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 468A(a) and ยง 1.468A-2(a). Thus, for example, except in the case of a special transfer pursuant to ยง 1.468A-8, securities may not be contributed to a nuclear decommissioning fund even if the taxpayer or a fund established by the taxpayer previously held such securities for the purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant.
