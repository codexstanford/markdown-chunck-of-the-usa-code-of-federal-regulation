###### ยง 1.337(d)-5 Old transitional rules imposing tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT
####### Effective date.

(d)In the case of carryover basis transactions involving the transfer of property of a C corporation to a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to transactions occurring on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to such qualifications that are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. However, RICs and REITs that are subject to section 1374 treatment under this section may not rely on paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but must apply paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(3) of ยง 1.337(d)-6, with respect to built-in gains and losses recognized in taxable years beginning on or after January 2, 2002. In lieu of applying this section, taxpayers may rely on ยง 1.337(d)-6 to determine the tax consequences (for all taxable years) of any conversion transaction. For transactions and qualifications that occur on or after January 2, 2002, see ยง 1.337(d)-7.
