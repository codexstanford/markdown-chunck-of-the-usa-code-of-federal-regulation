(iv)Any motor vehicle, ship, aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or any container transported thereby, which is used exclusively in the commercial transportation of persons or property to or from the United States (including such transportation from one place to another in the United States) and is ordinarily located in the United States will be considered property in the United States both when such property is ordinarily located in, and when such property is temporarily located outside, the United States. Whether such property is used in the transportation of persons or property to or from the United States and is ordinarily located in the United States are issues to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case. However, in all cases such transportation property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if either more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States or such property is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during such period. Further, such transportation property will not at any time be considered property in the United States if either not more than 30 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States or such property is located in the United States for not more than 30 percent of the time during such period. Nevertheless, if not more than 30 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such transportation property are traversed within the United States, such property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during such period Moreover, if such transportation property is located in the United States for not more than 30 percent of the time during the applicable policy period, such property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during such period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States. If such transportation property is considered property in the United States because more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States, the apportionment of premium provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made on a mileage basis. If, however, such property is considered property in the United States because such property is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during the applicable policy period, the apportionment of premium provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made on a time basis.
