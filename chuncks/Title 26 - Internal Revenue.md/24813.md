(3)If a consolidated AFS does not separately list items for the taxpayer, the portion of the AFS revenue allocable to the taxpayer is determined by relying on the taxpayer's separate source documents that were used to create the consolidated AFS and includes amounts subsequently eliminated in the consolidated AFS. Whether a taxpayer that changes the source documents it uses for this purpose from one taxable year to another taxable year has changed its method of accounting is determined under the rules of section 446.
