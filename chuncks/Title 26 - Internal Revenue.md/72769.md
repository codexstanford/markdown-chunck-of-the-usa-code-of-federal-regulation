####### ยง 301.6221-1 Tax treatment determined at partnership level.
######## In general.

(a)A partner's treatment of partnership items on the partner's return may not be changed except as provided in sections 6222 through 6231 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, if a partner treats an item on the partner's return consistently with the treatment of the item on the partnership return, the IRS generally cannot adjust the treatment of that item on the partner's return except through a partnership-level proceeding. Similarly, the taxpayer may not put partnership items in issue in a proceeding relating to nonpartnership items. For example, the taxpayer may not offset a potential increase in taxable income based on changes to nonpartnership items by a potential decrease based on partnership items.
