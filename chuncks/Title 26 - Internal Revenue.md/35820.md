()FP is eligible for benefits under the Treaty and derives the gain on the deemed sale of U.S. Business section 1231 asset. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section, because gain from the disposition of the U.S. Business section 1231 asset does not form part of a U.S. PE, the gain is exempt from U.S. tax under the Treaty, and is not taken into account in determining FP's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section. Therefore, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $0x under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
