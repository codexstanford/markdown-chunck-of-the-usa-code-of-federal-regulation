####### Analysis.

(ii)The Segregated Pool is not a qualified segregated account, because it is not maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and because income attributable to assets in the Segregated Pool (including the Company A stock) may inure to Guarantor, which is not a qualified recipient. Accordingly, Fund and Guarantor do not qualify as an organization or arrangement that is an eligible fund with respect to the Company A stock. Therefore, Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale of its shares in Company A.
