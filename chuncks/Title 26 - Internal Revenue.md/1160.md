(B)To determine qualified basis, all 9 units in the identified qualified group of units are used in the applicable fraction determination when calculating qualified basis for purposes of determining the annual credit amount under section 42(a). Unit #6 could not have been identified in the qualified group of units for use in the applicable fraction determination because its lack of habitability prevents it from being a low-income unit. Thus, Units ##1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are taken into account in the applicable fraction determination.
