###### § 1.1382-2 Taxable income of cooperatives; treatment of patronage dividends.
####### Deduction for patronage dividends,In general.

(b)-(1)In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of any cooperative organization to which part I of subchapter T applies, amounts paid to patrons during the payment period for the taxable year as patronage dividends with respect to patronage occurring during such taxable year, but only to the extent that such amounts are paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (other than non qualified written notices of allocation). See section 1382 (e) and (f) and §§ 1.1382-5 and 1.1382-6 for special rules relating to the time when patronage is deemed to occur where products are marketed under a pooling arrangement or where earnings are includible in the gross income of the cooperative organization for a taxable year after the year in which the patronage occurred. For purposes of this paragraph, a written notice of allocation is considered paid when it is issued to the patron. A patronage dividend shall be treated as paid in money during the payment period for the taxable year to the extent it is paid by a qualified check which is issued during the payment period for such taxable year and endorsed and cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of such payment period. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when paid, and a qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount.
