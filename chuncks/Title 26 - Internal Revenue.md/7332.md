# Title 26 - Internal Revenue
## Chapter I - Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Income Tax
#### PART 1 - INCOME TAXES
##### Itemized Deductions for Individuals and Corporations
###### ยง 1.162-33 Certain employee remuneration in excess of $1,000,000 not deductible for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
####### Conclusion.

(B)If this section applies, Employee A is a covered employee for Corporation X's 2019 taxable year. Because the October 2, 2017, agreement is a written binding contract to pay Employee A $4,000,000 if Employee A is terminated without cause prior to December 31, 2020, and $200,000 if Corporation X terminates Employee A's employment without cause prior to October 31, 2019, this section does not apply (and ยง 1.162-27 does apply) to the deduction for $4,200,000 of Employee A's severance payment. The deduction for $4,200,000 of Employee A's severance payment is not subject to section 162(m)(1). Because the October 2, 2017, agreement is not a written binding contract to pay Employee A's $600,000 discretionary bonus (since, as of November 2, 2017, Corporation X was not obligated under applicable law to make the bonus payment), the deduction for $1,200,000 of the $5,400,000 payment is subject to this section (and not ยง 1.162-27).
