####### Examples.

(8)The following examples illustrate the AFS cost offset method. Unless the facts specifically state otherwise, the taxpayer has an AFS, is on a calendar year for both Federal income tax purposes and AFS purposes, uses an accrual method of accounting for Federal income tax purposes, and does not use a special method of accounting. Further, the taxpayer properly applies its inventory accounting method, uses the AFS cost offset method under paragraph (c) of this section, and, except as otherwise provided, does not receive advance payments. Lastly, the taxpayer does not produce unique items, as described in ยง 1.460-2(a)(1) and (b), or any item that normally requires more than 12 calendar months to complete, as determined under ยง 1.460-2(a)(2) and (c). Any production period that exceeds 12 calendar months is due to unforeseen production delays.
