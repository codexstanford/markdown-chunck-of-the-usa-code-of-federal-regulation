###### § 1.752-7 Partnership assumption of partner's § 1.752-7 liability on or after June 24, 2003.
####### Consequences to § 1.752-7 liability partner.

(2)If, at the time of an assumption of a § 1.752-7 liability from a partnership by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner, the § 1.752-7 liability partner remains a partner in the partnership, then the § 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest is reduced by the § 1.752-7 liability reduction (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section). If the assuming partner (or any successor) notifies the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section), then the § 1.752-7 liability partner is entitled to a deduction or loss. The amount of that deduction or loss is, in the case of a partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (but not, in total, more than the § 1.752-7 liability reduction) or, in the case of a complete satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the remaining § 1.752-7 liability reduction. To the extent of the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of that deduction or loss is determined as if the § 1.752-7 liability partner had satisfied the liability. To the extent that the § 1.752-7 liability reduction exceeds the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's loss is capital.
