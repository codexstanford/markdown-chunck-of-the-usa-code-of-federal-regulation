####### § 301.6226-3 Adjustments taken into account by partners.
######## Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.

(v)Adjustments taken into account under paragraph (e)(4) of this section that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(f)) are taken into account by the pass-through partner in accordance with § 301.6225-3 in the taxable year of the pass-through partner that includes the date the imputed underpayment required under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section is paid. If, after making the computation described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section, no imputed underpayment exists and therefore no payment is required under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the adjustments that did not result in an imputed underpayment are taken into account by the pass-through partner in accordance with § 301.6225-3 in the taxable year of the pass-through partner that includes the date the statement described in § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is furnished to the pass-through partner.
