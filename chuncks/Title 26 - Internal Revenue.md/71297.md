###### Definitions

(f)-(1) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, "fundraising" includes-

(i) Soliciting dues or contributions from members of the organization, from persons whose dues are in arrears, or from the general public,

(ii) Soliciting grants from businesses or other organizations, including organizations described in section 501(c)(3), or

(iii) Soliciting grants from a governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1), or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, a separate fundraising unit of any organization must consist of either two or more individuals a majority of whose time is spent on fundraising for the organization, or any separate accounting unit of the organization that is devoted to fundraising. For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, amounts paid to or incurred for a separate fundraising unit include all amounts incurred for the creation, production, copying, and distribution of the fundraising portion of a separate fundraising unit's communication. (For example, an electing public charity that has a separate fundraising unit may not count the cost of postage for a separate fundraising unit's communication as an exempt purpose expenditure even though, under the electing public charity's accounting system, that cost is attributable to the mailroom rather than to the separate fundraising unit.)

(3) For purposes of this section, a "controlled grant" is a grant made by an eligible organization described in ยง 1.501(h)-2(b) to an organization not described in section 501(c)(3) that meets the following requirements:

(i) The donor limits the grant to a specific project of the recipient that is in furtherance of the donor's (nonlobbying) exempt purposes; and

(ii) The donor maintains records to establish that the grant is used in furtherance of the donor's (nonlobbying) exempt purposes.

(4) A transfer, including a grant or payment of dues, is "earmarked" for a specific purpose-

(i) To the extent that the transferor directs the transferee to add the amount transferred to a fund established to accomplish the purpose, or

(ii) To the extent of the amount transferred or, if less, the amount agreed upon to the expended to accomplish the purpose, if there exists an agreement, oral or written, whereby the transferor may cause the transferee to expend amounts to accomplish the purpose or whereby the transferee agrees to expend an amount to accomplish the purpose.
