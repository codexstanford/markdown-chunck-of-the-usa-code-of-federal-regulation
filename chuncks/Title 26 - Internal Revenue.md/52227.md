####### Entitlement rule,In general.

(iv)-(A)For all Federal income tax purposes, an intercompany distribution is treated as taken into account when the shareholding member becomes entitled to it (generally on the record date). For example, if B becomes entitled to a cash distribution before it is made, the distribution is treated as made when B becomes entitled to it. For this purpose, B is treated as entitled to a distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305(c)). To the extent a distribution is not made, appropriate adjustments must be made as of the date it was taken into account.
