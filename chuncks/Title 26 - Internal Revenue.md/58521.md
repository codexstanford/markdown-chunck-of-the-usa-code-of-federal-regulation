####### Refund of required payment,In general.

(6)-(i)If a partnership or S corporation is entitled to make a claim for refund pursuant to ยง 1.7519-1T(c), such partnership or S corporation should file a claim for refund, as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. However, in no event shall a refund be made prior to April 15 of the second calendar year that follows the calendar year in which an applicable election year begins. For example, assume a partnership made a section 444 election to retain its taxable year for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987, and as a result made a required payment for such year. Further assume that the partnership terminates its election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988. Based on these facts, the partnership will be entitled to a refund, but no earlier than April 15, 1989.
