####### Example 3: Reinvestment of Realized API Gain.

(iii)A, B, and C are partners in PRS, a partnership. At the beginning of Year 1, A is issued an API in PRS in exchange for providing substantial services to PRS in an ATB. A has no capital interest in PRS. During Year 1, PRS's assets appreciate by $100. At the end of Year 1, under the terms of its partnership agreement, if PRS were to sell all of its assets at their fair market value and distribute the proceeds in a complete liquidation, A would receive $20 with respect to its API. Thus, at the end of Year 1, A has $20 of Unrealized API Gain. In Year 2, PRS sells Asset X, an asset that PRS owned in Year 1, and allocates $8 of the long-term capital gain to A as API Gain. As a result, $8 of A's $20 of Unrealized API Gain becomes API Gain that is subject to section 1061. A reinvests A's share of the proceeds from the Asset X sale in PRS. As a result, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, A has an $8 capital interest in PRS and, provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are met, A may receive future Capital Interest Allocations with respect to the capital interest.
