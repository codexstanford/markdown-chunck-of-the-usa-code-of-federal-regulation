(B)Deductions that are allocated and apportioned to the residual income group under paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A) of this section for purposes of applying the high-tax exclusion to a controlled foreign corporation's tentative gross tested income items are allocated and apportioned for purposes of determining the controlled foreign corporation's net income in each relevant statutory grouping using a method that provides for a consistent allocation and apportionment of deductions to gross income in the relevant groupings. See §§ 1.954-1(c) and 1.960-1(d)(3) for rules relating to the allocation and apportionment of expenses for purposes of determining subpart F income, which is included in the residual grouping for purposes of applying the high-tax exclusion of sections 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III) and 954(b)(4) and paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
