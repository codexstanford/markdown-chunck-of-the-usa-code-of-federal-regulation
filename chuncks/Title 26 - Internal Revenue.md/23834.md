####### Treatment of plan amendments that do not take effect.

(iv)If a plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective date of the amendment because of the limitations of section 436(c) and paragraph (c) of this section, but is permitted to take effect later in the plan year as a result of additional contributions under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, then the plan amendment must automatically take effect as of the first day of the plan year (or, if later, the original effective date of the amendment). If the plan amendment cannot take effect during the plan year, then it must be treated as if it were never adopted, unless the plan amendment provides otherwise.
