####### ยง 31.3121(b)(6)-1 Services in employ of United States or instrumentality thereof.
######## Services performed for an instrumentality not subject to employer tax on December 31, 1950, and covered under a retirement system established by such instrumentality.

(c)(1) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, services performed in the employ of an instrumentality of the United States are excepted from employment under section 3121(b)(6)(B) if-

(i) The particular instrumentality was not subject on December 31, 1950, to the employer tax imposed by section 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and

(ii) The services are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality.

(2) If the particular instrumentality was not in existence on December 31, 1950, but is created thereafter under a law which was in effect on December 31, 1950, services performed in the employ of such instrumentality are excepted from employment (unless otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) if-

(i) The instrumentality had it been in existence on December 31, 1950, would not have been subject on that date to the employer tax imposed by section 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and

(ii) The services are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality.

(3) Determinations as to whether services performed in the employ of an instrumentality referred to in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section are covered by a retirement system established by such instrumentality are to be made as of the time such services are performed. Services of an employee who has an option to have his services covered under a retirement system established by the instrumentality are not covered under such retirement system unless and until he exercises such option. The test is whether particular services performed by an employee are covered by a retirement system established by the instrumentality rather than whether the position in which such services are performed is covered by such retirement system.

(4) The exception from employment provided in section 3121(b)(6)(B) has no application with respect to any of the following classes of services:

(i) Services performed in the employ of a corporation which is wholly owned by the United States;

(ii) Services performed in the employ of a production credit association, a Federal Reserve Bank, or a Federal Credit Union; services performed before December 31, 1959, in the employ of a national farm loan association; services performed after December 30, 1959, in the employ of a Federal land bank association; services performed after December 31, 1959, in the employ of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives; services performed after December 31, 1972, in the employ of a Federal home loan bank; and services performed after December 31, 1966, and before January 1, 1973, in the employ of a Federal home loan bank, in the case of individuals who are in such employ on the latter date, provided that an amount equal to the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 with respect to all such services performed by all such individuals are paid under the provisions of section 3122 by July 1, 1973;

(iii) Services performed in the employ of a State, county, or community committee under the Commodity Stabilization Service;

(iv) Services performed by a civilian employee, not compensated from funds appropriated by the Congress, in the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Army and Air Force Motion Picture Service, Navy Exchanges, Marine Corps Exchanges, or other activities, conducted by an instrumentality of the United States subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, at installations of the Department of Defense for the comfort, pleasure, contentment, and mental and physical improvement of personnel of such Department; or

(v) Services performed by a civilian employee, not compensated from funds appropriated by the Congress, in the Coast Guard Exchanges or other activities, conducted by an instrumentality of the United States subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, at installations of the Coast Guard for the comfort, pleasure, contentment, and mental and physical improvement of personnel of the Coast Guard.
