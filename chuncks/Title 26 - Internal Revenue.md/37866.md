####### Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.

(ii)This paragraph (g)(2)(ii) applies when a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount, or portion thereof, is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. If the reverse hybrid is the RFA owner (U.S.), a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the reverse hybrid takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs. If the reverse hybrid is not the RFA owner (U.S.) but instead the reverse hybrid directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid, which, in turn, includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the RFA owner (U.S.) in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the RFA owner (U.S.) takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.
