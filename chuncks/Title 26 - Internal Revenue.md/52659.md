() In Year 5, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 5). None of P, S, or T has any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss in Year 5. Although the members of the P SRLY subgroup do not contribute to the $100 of consolidated taxable income in Year 5, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 5 is $35 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $28 ($35 x 80 percent). Because of the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of net operating losses in Year 5 is limited to $80 ($100 x 80 percent). Because the $28 of net operating loss available to be absorbed is less than 80 percent of the M group's consolidated taxable income, $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss is absorbed in Year 5, and the remaining $9 ($37-$28) is carried over to Year 6.
