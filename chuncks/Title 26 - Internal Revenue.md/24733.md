####### Analysis for 2022.

(C)Because, in 2022, A's obligation to Customer with respect to the good ends in a transaction other than a transaction described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, A is required to apply the acceleration rules in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Accordingly, because A received $40x of payments as of the date of the transaction, but did not include any portion of such payments in gross income in prior years, A is required to include the remaining $40x of the payments received in gross income in 2022 pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section. A is not permitted to further reduce the $40x income inclusion by a cost of goods in progress offset under this paragraph (c).
