###### ยง 1.981-1 Foreign law community income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, and before January 1, 1977.
####### Trade or business income.

(3)If any income derived from a trade or business carried on by the husband or wife is community income for the taxable year, all of the gross income, and the deductions attributable to such income, shall be treated as the gross income and deductions of the husband unless the wife exercises substantially all of the management and control of the trade or business, in which case all of the gross income and deductions shall be treated as the gross income and deductions of the wife. This subparagraph does not apply to any income derived from a trade or business carried on by a partnership of which both or one of the spouses is a member. For purposes of this subparagraph, income derived from a trade or business includes any income derived from a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income producing factors. The term "management and control" means management and control in fact, not the management and control imputed to the husband under the community property laws of a foreign country. For example, a wife who operates a beauty parlor without any appreciable collaboration on the part of a husband is considered as having substantially all of the management and control of the business despite the provisions of any community property laws of a foreign country vesting in the husband the right of management and control of community property; and the income and deductions attributable to the operation of the beauty parlor are considered the income and deductions of the wife.
