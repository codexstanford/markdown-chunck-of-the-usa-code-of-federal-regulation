####### Apportionment.

(C)Qualified clinical testing expenses to which paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(B) of this section applies shall be apportioned among the persons who are partners during the taxable year in accordance with section 704 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of section 28, these expenses shall be treated as paid or incurred directly by the partners rather than by the partnership. Thus, the partnership shall disregard these expenses in computing the credit to be apportioned under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, and each partner shall aggregate the portion of these expenses allocated to the partner with other qualified clinical testing expenses of the partner in making the computations under section 28.
