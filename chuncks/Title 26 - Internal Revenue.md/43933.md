###### § 1.1014-9 Special rule with respect to DISC stock.
####### In general.

(a)If property consisting of stock of a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a) (1) or (3) as the case may be) is considered to have been acquired from a decedent (within the meaning of paragraph (a) or (b) of § 1.1014-2), the uniform basis of such stock under section 1014, as determined pursuant to §§ 1.1014-1 through 1.1014-8 shall be reduced as provided in this section. Such uniform basis shall be reduced by the amount (hereinafter referred to in this section as the amount of reduction), if any, which the decedent would have included in his gross income under section 995(c) as a dividend if the decedent had lived and sold such stock at its fair market value on the estate tax valuation date. If the alternate valuation date for Federal estate tax purposes is elected under section 2032, in computing the gain which the decedent would have had if he had lived and sold the stock on the alternate valuation date, the decedent's basis shall be determined with reduction for any distributions with respect to the stock which may have been made, after the date of the decedent's death and on or before the alternate valuation date, from the DISC's previously taxed income (as defined in section 996(f)(2)). For this purpose, the last sentence of section 996(e)(2) (relating to reductions of basis of DISC stock) shall not apply. For purposes of this section, if the corporation is not a DISC or former DISC at the date of the decedent's death but is a DISC for a taxable year which begins after such date and on or before the alternate valuation date, the corporation will be considered to be a DISC or former DISC only if the alternate valuation date is elected. The provisions of this paragraph apply with respect to stock of a DISC or former DISC which is included in the gross estate of the decedent, including but not limited to property which-

(1) Is acquired from the decedent before his death, and the entire property is subsequently included in the decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes, or

(2) Is acquired property described in paragraph (d) of § 1.1014-3.
