###### ยง 1.163-13 Treatment of bond issuance premium.
####### Inflation-indexed debt instruments.

(2)An issuer determines bond issuance premium on an inflation-indexed debt instrument by assuming that there will be no inflation or deflation over the term of the instrument. The issuer also allocates any bond issuance premium among the accrual periods by assuming that there will be no inflation or deflation over the term of the instrument. The bond issuance premium allocable to an accrual period offsets qualified stated interest allocable to the period. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(4) of this section, if the bond issuance premium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the qualified stated interest allocable to the period, the excess is treated as a deflation adjustment under ยง 1.1275-7(f)(1)(ii). See ยง 1.1275-7 for other rules relating to inflation-indexed debt instruments.
