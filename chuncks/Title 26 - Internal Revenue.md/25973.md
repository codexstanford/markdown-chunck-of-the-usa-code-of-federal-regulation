####### Special rule permitting payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund before receipt of an initial or revised ruling amount applicable to a taxable year.

(g)(1) If an electing taxpayer has filed a timely request for an initial or revised ruling amount for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and does not receive the ruling amount on or before the deemed payment deadline date for such taxable year, the taxpayer may make a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund on the basis of the ruling amount proposed in the taxpayer's request. Thus, under the preceding sentence, an electing taxpayer may make a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund for such taxable year that does not exceed the ruling amount proposed by the taxpayer for such taxable year in a timely filed request for a schedule of ruling amounts.

(2) If an electing taxpayer makes a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund for any taxable year pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the ruling amount that is provided by the IRS is greater than the ruling amount proposed by the taxpayer for such taxable year, the taxpayer is not allowed to make an additional payment to the fund for such taxable year after the deemed payment deadline date for such taxable year.

(3) If the payment or transfer that an electing taxpayer makes to a nuclear decommissioning fund for any taxable year pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section exceeds the ruling amount that is provided by the IRS for such taxable year, the following rules apply:

(i) The amount of the excess is an excess contribution (as defined in ยง 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii)) for such taxable year.
