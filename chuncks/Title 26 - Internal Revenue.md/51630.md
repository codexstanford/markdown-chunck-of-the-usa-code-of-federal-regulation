####### Preexisting account certification.,7,6

(5)The responsible officer of a sponsoring entity must make the certification described in ยง 1.1471-4(c)(7) (preexisting account certification of a participating FFI) with respect to each sponsored FFI that enters into the sponsorship agreement with the sponsoring entity during the certification period (as defined in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section). However, the preexisting account certification is not required for a sponsored FFI that, immediately before the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a participating FFI, a sponsored FFI of another sponsoring entity, or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a local FFI or a restricted fund, if the FFI (or the FFI's former sponsoring entity, if applicable) provides a written certification to the sponsoring entity that the FFI has made the preexisting account certification required under ยง 1.1471-4(c)(7) or paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A)() or (f)(1)(i)(D)() of this section (as applicable), unless the sponsoring entity knows that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect. In addition, the preexisting account certification is not required for a sponsored FFI that enters into the sponsorship agreement with the sponsoring entity during the two year period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes the preexisting account certification for such FFI for the subsequent certification period. The certification described in this paragraph (j)(5) for the certification period must be submitted by the due date of the sponsoring entity's certification of compliance required under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section for the certification period (or the extended due date described in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section for the certification period ending on December 31, 2017), on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. With respect to a sponsored FFI for which the sponsoring entity makes a preexisting account certification, a preexisting obligation means any account, instrument, or contract (including any debt or equity interest) maintained, executed, or issued by the sponsored FFI that is outstanding on the earlier of the date the FFI is issued a GIIN as a sponsored FFI or the date the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
