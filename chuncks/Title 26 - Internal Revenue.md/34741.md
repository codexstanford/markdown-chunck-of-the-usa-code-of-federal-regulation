####### 2,U.S. dollar approximate separate transactions method.

()In the case of a branch to which the U.S. dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting described in ยง 1.985-3 applies, the beginning-of-year dollar amount of the assets is determined by reference to the end-of-year balance sheet of the branch for the immediately preceding taxable year, adjusted for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and Federal income tax accounting principles, and translated into U.S. dollars as provided in ยง 1.985-3(c). The end-of-year dollar amount of the assets of the branch is determined in the same manner by reference to the end-of-year balance sheet for the current taxable year. The beginning-of-year and end-of-year dollar tax book value of assets, as so determined, within each grouping is then averaged as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
