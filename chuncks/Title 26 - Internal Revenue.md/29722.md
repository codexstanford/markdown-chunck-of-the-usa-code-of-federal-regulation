####### Application of section 381(c)(15).

(h)Under section 381(c)(15), if an acquiring corporation assumes liability for qualified indebtedness in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation is considered to be the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of section 545(c). Paragraph (c)(2) of this section reflects the application of section 381(c)(15) by including an acquiring corporation within the definition of corporation to which this section applies. Thus, the acquiring corporation is not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to such acquired qualified indebtedness to which section 381(c)(15) is applicable. All the other provisions of this section apply in full to the acquiring corporation with respect to such acquired indebtedness.
