###### ยง 1.761-3 Certain option holders treated as partners.
####### Option.,option

(3)Anis a contractual right to acquire an interest in the issuing partnership, including a call option, warrant, or other similar arrangement. In addition, an option includes convertible debt (as defined in ยง 1.721-2(g)(2)) and convertible equity (as defined in ยง 1.721-2(g)(3)). To achieve the purposes of this section, the Commissioner can treat other contractual agreements, including a forward contract, a futures contract, or a notional principal contract, as an option. A contract that otherwise constitutes an option will not fail to be treated as an option for purposes of this section merely because it may or must be settled in cash or property other than a partnership interest.
