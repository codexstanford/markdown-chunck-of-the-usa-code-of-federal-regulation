(h)-(1)Except as otherwise provided in the FFI agreement, if there has been an overpayment of tax with respect to an account holder or payee of a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI resulting from tax withheld under chapter 4 by either the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI or by its withholding agent during a calendar year and the amount withheld has not been recovered under the reimbursement or set-off procedures described in ยง 1.1474-2(a) (applied by either the withholding agent or the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI), the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI may request a credit or refund from the IRS of the overpayment to the extent permitted under this paragraph (h) on behalf of such account holder or payee. For purposes of this paragraph (h), an overpayment means an amount withheld in excess of the account holder or payee's U.S. tax liability with respect to the payment (including overwithholding as defined ยง 1.1474-2(a)(2)). If a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI does not elect the procedure provided in this paragraph (h) to request a credit or refund, the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI is required to (or must request that its withholding agent) file and furnish within a reasonable period a Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and Form 1042 (or amended forms) to report to any account holder or payee that has requested such form with regard to the tax withheld by the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI or its withholding agent.
