###### § 1.1275-6 Integration of qualifying debt instruments.
####### Taxation of integrated transactions,General rule.

(f)-(1)An integrated transaction is generally treated as a single transaction by the taxpayer during the period that the transaction qualifies as an integrated transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(12) of this section, while a qualifying debt instrument and a § 1.1275-6 hedge are part of an integrated transaction, neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the § 1.1275-6 hedge is subject to the rules that would apply on a separate basis to the debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, including section 1092 or § 1.446-4. The rules that would govern the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument generally govern the treatment of the integrated transaction. For example, the integrated transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or, if the synthetic debt instrument would be part of a straddle, section 1092. Generally, the synthetic debt instrument is subject to sections 163(e) and 1271 through 1275, with terms as set forth in paragraphs (f) (2) through (13) of this section.
