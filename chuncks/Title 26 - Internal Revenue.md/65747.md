###### Payees filing a joint return,In general.

(j)-(1)For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to a joint return filed by a husband and wife, then the provisions of this section shall apply to the payees collectively. As a result, both payees will be subject to backup withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists (as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section). Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that backup withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section).
