####### Owner.

(2)(i) For purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, an owner of a production is any person that is required under section 263A to capitalize the costs of producing the production into the cost basis of the production, or that would be required to do so if section 263A applied to that person.

(ii) Further, a person that acquires a finished or partially-finished production is treated as an owner of that production for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, but only if the production is acquired prior to its initial release or broadcast (as defined in paragraph (a)(7) of this section). Moreover, a person that acquires only a limited license or right to exploit a production, or receives an interest or profit participation in a production, as compensation for services, is not an owner of the production for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6.
