###### ยง 1.482-7 Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a cost sharing arrangement.
####### The effect of taxation on determining the arm's length amount.,1

(G)() In principle, the present values of the cost sharing and licensing alternatives should be determined by applying post-tax discount rates to post-tax income (including the post-tax value to the controlled participant of the PCT Payments). If such approach is adopted, then the post-tax value of the PCT Payments must be appropriately adjusted in order to determine the arm's length amount of the PCT Payments on a pre-tax basis. See paragraph (g)(2)(x) of this section.
