######## Change in corporation.

(d)If a corporation changes its name, no additional tax is due, provided the change in name is registered with the district director in the manner required by paragraph (a) of this section. An increase in the capital stock of a corporation does not create a new special tax liability if the laws of the State under which it is incorporated permit such increase without the formation of a new corporation. A stockholder in a corporation, who after its dissolution continues the business, incurs liability for the special tax imposed by section 4411 unless he already has a special tax stamp obtained in respect of activities conducted as a sole proprietor.
