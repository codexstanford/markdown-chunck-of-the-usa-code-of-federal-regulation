####### Cumulative gas balancing method,In general.

(3)-(i)The cumulative gas balancing method (cumulative method), solely for purposes of reporting income from gas sales and certain related deductions and credits, treats each co-producer under the same JOA as the sole owner of its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir and disregards the ownership arrangement described in the JOA for gas as it is produced from the reservoir. Each co-producer is considered to be taking only its share of the total gas in the reservoir as long as the gas remaining in the reservoir is sufficient to satisfy the ownership rights of the co-producers in their percentage shares of the total gas in the reservoir. After a co-producer has taken its entire share of the total gas in the reservoir, any additional gas taken by that co-producer (taking co-producer) is treated as having been taken from its other co-producers' shares of the total gas in the reservoir. The effect of being treated as a taking co-producer under the cumulative method is that the taking co-producer generally may not claim an allowance for depletion and a production credit on its sales of its other co-producers' percentage shares of the total gas in the reservoir.
