(3)A member's allocation of excess business interest expense from a partnership and the resulting decrease in basis in the partnership interest under section 163(j)(4)(B)(iii)(I) is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense for purposes of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii). Additionally, an increase in a member's basis in a partnership interest under section 163(j)(4)(B)(iii)(II) to reflect excess business interest expense not deducted by the consolidated group is not tax-exempt income for purposes of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii). Investment adjustments are made under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(i) when the excess business interest expense from the partnership is converted into business interest expense, deducted, and absorbed by the consolidated group. See § 1.1502-32(b).
