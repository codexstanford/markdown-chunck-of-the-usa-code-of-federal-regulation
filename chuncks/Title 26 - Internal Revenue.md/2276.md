####### a,b

(2)(i) Property shall not qualify as used section 38 property if, after its acquisition by the taxpayer, it is used by () a person who used such property before such acquisition, or () a person who bears a relationship described in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B) to a person who used such property before such acquisition. Thus, for example, if property is used by a person and is later sold by him under a sale and lease-back arrangement, such property in the hands of the purchaser-lessor is not used section 38 property because the property, after its acquisition, is being used by the same person who used it before its acquisition. Similarly, where a lessee has been leasing property and subsequently purchases it (whether or not the lease contains an option to purchase), such property is not used section 38 property with respect to the purchaser because the property is being used by the same person who used it before its acquisition. In addition, if property owned by a lessor is sold subject to the lease, or is sold upon the termination of the lease, the property will not qualify as used section 38 property with respect to the purchaser if, after the purchase, the property is used by a person who used the property as a lessee before the purchase.

(ii) For purposes of applying subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, property shall not be considered as used by a person before its acquisition if such property was used only on a casual basis by such person.

(iii) In determining whether a person bears a relationship described in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B) to a person who used property before its acquisition by the taxpayer, the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of ยง 1.179-3 shall apply, except that the definition of "component member" of a controlled group of corporations in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be substituted for the definition of such term in paragraph (e) of ยง 1.179-3.

(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
