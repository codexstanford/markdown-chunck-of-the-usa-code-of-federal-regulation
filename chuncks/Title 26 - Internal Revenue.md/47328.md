###### ยง 1.1313(a)-3 Final disposition of claim for refund as a determination.
####### In general.

(a)A determination may take the form of a final disposition of a claim for refund. Such disposition may result in a determination with respect to two classes of items, i.e., items included by the taxpayer in a claim for refund and items applied by the Commissioner to offset the alleged overpayment. The time at which a disposition in respect of a particular item becomes final may depend not only upon what action is taken with respect to that item but also upon whether the claim for refund is allowed or disallowed.
