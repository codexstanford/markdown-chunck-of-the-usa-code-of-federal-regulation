In such a case, the district director must designate those wages, salary, or other income from which the exempt amount is to be paid to the taxpayer, and must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served of the amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy. The employer or other person may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy.
