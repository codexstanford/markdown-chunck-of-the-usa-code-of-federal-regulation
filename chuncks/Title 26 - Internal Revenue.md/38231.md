####### Analysis,1,Disregarded payment from FDE1 to FDE2.,1

(B)-()The $1,000x of gross income earned by FDE1 from the Customer A services would, but for paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, be attributable to FDE1 (a foreign branch). Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(F)() of this section, adjustments related to disregarded payments from FDE1 to FDE2 are computed before adjustments related to disregarded payments from FDE2 to P (in its capacity as a foreign branch owner). The disregarded payment from FDE1 to FDE2 is not recorded on FDE2's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE1 because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE1's $1,000x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under ยง 1.861-8. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE1 is adjusted downward, and the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE2 is adjusted upward, to take the disregarded payment into account. Thus, $200x of FDE1's non-passive category foreign source gross income from the performance of Customer A services is attributable to FDE2 for purposes of this section, and $800x of that income is attributable to FDE1.
