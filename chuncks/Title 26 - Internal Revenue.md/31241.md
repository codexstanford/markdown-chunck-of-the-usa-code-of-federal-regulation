###### ยง 1.668(b)-3A Computation of the beneficiary's income and tax for a prior taxable year.
####### Basis for computation.

(a)(1) The beneficiary's income and tax paid for any prior taxable year for which a recomputation is involved under either the exact method or the short-cut method shall be determined by reference to the information required to be furnished by him under ยง 1.668(b)-4A(a). The gross income, related deductions, and taxes paid for a prior taxable year of the beneficiary as finally determined shall be used for computation purposes. The term "as finally determined" has reference to the final status of the gross income, deductions, credits, and taxes of the taxable year after the expiration of the period of limitations or after completion of any court action regarding the tax for the taxable year.

(2) If any computations rely on the beneficiary's return for a prior taxable year for which the applicable period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 has expired, and such return shows a mathematical error on its face which resulted in the wrong amount of tax being paid for such year, the determination of both the tax for such year computed with the inclusion of the section 666 amount in the beneficiary's gross income and the tax for such year computed without including such amounts in such gross income shall be based upon the return after the correction of such mathematical errors, and the beneficiary shall be credited for the correct amount of tax that should have been properly paid.
