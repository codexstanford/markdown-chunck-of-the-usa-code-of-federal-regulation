######## Cease to exist defined,In general.

(b)-(1)If a partnership ceases to exist, the IRS will notify the partnership and the former partners (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in writing, within 30 days of such determination using the last known address of the partnership and the former partners. A failure by the IRS to send a notification under this paragraph (b)(1) to a former partner of the partnership does not invalidate the determination by the IRS that the partnership ceases to exist. If an audited partnership (as defined in ยง 301.6226-3(e)(1)) ceases to exist, the IRS will also notify the partnership representative for the reviewed year. For purposes of this section, a partnership ceases to exist if the IRS makes a determination that a partnership ceases to exist because:

(i) The partnership terminates within the meaning of section 708(b)(1); or

(ii) The partnership does not have the ability to pay, in full, any amount that may be due under the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 for which the partnership is or may become liable. For purposes of this section, a partnership does not have the ability to pay if the IRS determines that the partnership's account is currently not collectible based on the information the IRS has at the time of such determination.
