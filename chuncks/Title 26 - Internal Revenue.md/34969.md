()For purposes of this section, if a taxpayer owned the stock of a specified foreign corporation (as defined in § 1.965-1(f)(45)) as of the close of the last taxable year of the specified foreign corporation that began before January 1, 2018, the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of the specified foreign corporation for that taxable year and any subsequent taxable year is determined as if the taxpayer did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i) (regardless of whether the election was actually made) and is further adjusted as described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)()(). If § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B) applied (or would have applied if the election had been made) with respect to the stock of a specified foreign corporation, the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of the specified foreign corporation is reduced by the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)() (without regard to the rule for limited basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)() and the limitation in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(C), and without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(h)(2)). The reduction in the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock may reduce the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock below zero prior to the application of paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A)() and () of this section. No adjustment is made in the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of a specified foreign corporation for an amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(A). To the extent that, in an exchange described in section 351, 354, or 356, a taxpayer receives stock of a foreign corporation in exchange for stock of a specified foreign corporation described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)()(), this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)()() applies to such stock received.
