###### ยง 1.1441-1 Requirement for the deduction and withholding of tax on payments to foreign persons.
####### Special rule for determining validity of withholding certificate containing inconsequential errors.

(iv)A withholding agent may treat a withholding certificate as valid when the certificate includes an error described as an inconsequential error in ยง 1.1471-3(c)(7)(i) for which the withholding agent obtains documentation sufficient for supporting a payee's claim of status as a foreign person or, for a payee that is an entity, its classification to the extent permitted under ยง 1.1471-3(c)(7)(i). For example, if the country of residence is abbreviated in an ambiguous way on a beneficial owner withholding certificate provided to establish the beneficial owner's foreign status, a withholding agent may treat the withholding certificate as valid if it has obtained documentary evidence supporting that the beneficial owner's residence is in a country other than the United States.
