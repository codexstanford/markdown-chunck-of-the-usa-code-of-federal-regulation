(a)If a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement meets the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and ยง 1.62-2 and the expenses are substantiated within a reasonable period of time, payments made under the arrangement that do not exceed the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under an accountable plan and are not wages.
