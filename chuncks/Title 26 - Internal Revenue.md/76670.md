######## Special rules for making the election to be treated as a resident alien.

(ix)The election under Act section 1810(l)(4) (Code section 7701(b)) to be treated as a resident under Code section 7701(b) shall be made by an alien individual by attaching a statement to the individual's income tax return (Form 1040), for the taxable year for which the election is to be in effect (the election year). The alien individual may not make this election until such time as he has satisfied the substantial presence test of Code section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) for the year following the election year. If an alien individual has not satisfied the substantial presence test for the year following the election year as of the due date (without regard to extensions) of the tax return for the election year, the alien individual may request an extension of time for filing the return until after he has satisfied such test, provided that he pays with his extension application the amount of tax he expects to owe for the election year, computed as if he were a non-resident alien throughout the election year. The statement shall include the name and address of the alien individual and contain a signed declaration that the election is being made. It must specify-

(A) That the alien individual was not a resident in the year immediately preceding the election year;

(B) That the alien individual is a resident in the year immediately following the election year under the substantial presence test and the individual's number of days of presence in the United States during such year;

(C) The date or dates of the alien individual's 31 consecutive day period of presence and continuous presence in the United States during the election year; and

(D) The date or dates of absence from the United States during the election year that are deemed to be days of presence.
