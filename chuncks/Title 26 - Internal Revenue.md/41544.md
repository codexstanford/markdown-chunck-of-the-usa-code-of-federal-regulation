####### Requirements for deficiency distribution,Distribution made on or after date of determination.

(b)-(1)If-

(i) A United States shareholder, in making its return of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for any taxable year, elects to secure an exclusion under section 963 for such year,

(ii) It is subsequently determined (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) that an exclusion under section 963 of subpart F income with respect to stock to which such election relates does not apply for such taxable year because of the failure of such shareholder to receive a minimum distribution for such year with respect to such stock, and

(iii) Such failure is due to reasonable cause, a deficiency distribution which is received by such shareholder with respect to such stock from a foreign corporation which was the single first-tier corporation, or a corporation in the chain or group, as the case may be, with respect to which the election was made, shall count toward a minimum distribution under section 963 for such year of election if such deficiency distribution is received (except as provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) on, or within 90 days after, the date of such determination and prior to the filing of a claim under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Such claim must be filed within 120 days after the date of such determination, and the deficiency distribution must be a dividend of such a nature (except as otherwise provided in this section) as would have permitted it to count toward a minimum distribution for the taxable year of the election if it had been received by the United States shareholder during such year. No distribution shall count as a deficiency distribution under this subparagraph unless a claim therefor is filed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
