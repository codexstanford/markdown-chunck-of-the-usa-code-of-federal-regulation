###### ยง 1.45Q-5 Recapture of Credit.
####### Example 3.

(iii)(A) Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that A sells Facility X to C on January 1, 2024. C sells 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide captured by Facility X to B for use as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil recovery project. C claims a section 45Q credit in 2024 of $2,706,300 (net 90,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide captured, disposed of in secure geological storage, and used as a tertiary injectant multiplied by the statutory credit rate for 2024 of $30.07).

(B) The total recapture amount in 2025 is the same $5,467,300 as in Example 2, but is allocated between A and C. The first 90,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide are deemed attributable to 2024. The credits that are attributable to 2024 are recaptured at the 2024 statutory rate of $30.07 per ton (for a recapture amount of $2,706,300). Because C claimed that amount of section 45Q credit in 2024, a recapture amount of $2,706,300 is added to C's tax due for 2025. The remaining 100,000 metric tons of recaptured qualified carbon oxide are deemed attributable to 2023. The credits that are attributable to 2023 are recaptured at the 2023 statutory rate of $27.61 per ton (for a recapture amount of $2,761,000). Because A claimed that amount of section 45Q credit in 2023, a recapture amount of $2,761,000 is added to A's tax due for 2025.
