####### Analysis.

(ii)Under the 70 percent full inclusion rule of section 954(b)(3)(B), the entire $100x is foreign base company income currently taxable to USP under section 951. Because $75x of the $100x section 951 inclusion is attributable to CFC's passive category income, $75x of the inclusion is passive category income to USP. The remaining $25x of the inclusion is treated as general category income to USP.
