####### Partner's share of the cost of QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership.

(3)The partner's share of the cost (adjusted basis) of replacement QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership is the percentage of the partnership's future income and gain, if any, that is reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner (determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1045) with respect to the replacement QSB stock that was purchased by the partnership, multiplied by the cost of that replacement QSB stock. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of income and gain must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same item of income or gain as being reasonably expected to be allocated to more than one partner.
