###### ยง 1.871-10 Election to treat real property income as effectively connected with U.S. business.
####### When election may be made.

(a)A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which during the taxable year derives any income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, or derives income from any interest in any such property, may elect, pursuant to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this section, to treat all such income as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. The election may be made whether or not the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year for which the election is made or whether or not the taxpayer has income from real property which for the taxable year is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, but it may be made only with respect to that income from sources within the United States which, without regard to this section, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer. If for the taxable year the taxpayer has no income from real property located in the United States, or from any interest in such property, which is subject to the tax imposed by section 871(a) or 881(a), the election may not be made. But if an election has been properly made under this section for a taxable year, the election remains in effect, unless properly revoked, for subsequent taxable years even though during any such subsequent taxable year there is no income from the real property, or interest therein, in respect of which the election applies.
