###### ยง 25.2523(g)-1 Special rule for charitable remainder trusts.
####### Charitable remainder trusts where the donee spouse and the donor are not the only noncharitable beneficiaries.

(b)In the case of a charitable remainder trust where the donor and the donor's spouse are not the only noncharitable beneficiaries (for example, where the noncharitable interest is payable to the donor's spouse for life and then to another individual (other than the donor) for life), the qualification of the interest as qualified terminable interest property is determined solely under section 2523(f) and not under section 2523(g). Accordingly, if the transfer to the trust is made prior to October 24, 1992, the spousal annuity or unitrust interest may qualify under ยง 25.2523(f)-(1)(c)(3) as a qualifying income interest for life.
