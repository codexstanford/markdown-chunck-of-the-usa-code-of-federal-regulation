####### Required equipment rule.

(4)(i) A single purpose agricultural structure must also house equipment necessary to house, raise, and feed the livestock ("required equipment"). Required equipment must be an integral part of the structure, and includes, but is not limited to, equipment necessary to contain the livestock, to provide them with water or feed, and to control the temperature, lighting, and humidity of the interior of the structure. For purposes of this section, equipment is an integral part of the structure if it is physically attached to or a part of the structure. The useful life of the structure, however, need not be contemporaneous with the life of the equipment it houses. A structure without required equipment is not a single purpose agricultural structure.

(ii) A single purpose agricultural structure may, but is not required to, house equipment (for example, loading chutes) necessary to the conduct of ancillary post-production activities as defined in paragraph (f) of this section.
