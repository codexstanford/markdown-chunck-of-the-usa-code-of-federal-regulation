###### ยง 1.527-9 Special rule for principal campaign committees.
####### Manner of revoking designation.

(c)A designation of a principal campaign committee that has been filed in accordance with this section may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. In general, the Commissioner will grant such consent in every case where the candidate for Congress has revoked his or her designation in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Election Commission by filing an amended Statement of Organization or its equivalent pursuant to 11 CFR 102.2(a)(2). In the case of the revocation of the designation of a principal campaign committee by a candidate followed by the designation of another principal campaign committee by such candidate, for purposes of determining the appropriate rate of tax under section 11(b) for a taxable year, the political organization taxable income of the first principal campaign committee shall be treated as that of the subsequent principal campaign committee. In a case where consent to revoke a designation of a principal campaign committee is granted and a new designation is filed, the Commissioner may condition his consent upon the agreement of the candidate for Congress to insure compliance with the preceding sentence.
