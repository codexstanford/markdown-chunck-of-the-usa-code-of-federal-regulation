####### Receipt of property or boot by QOF shareholder.

(ii)If a QOF shareholder receives property or boot, or is treated as having received property or boot, with respect to its qualifying investment in a recapitalization, then the property or boot is treated as property or boot to which section 301 or section 356(a) or (c) applies, as determined under general Federal income tax principles. If, in a section 1036 exchange, a QOF shareholder receives property with respect to its qualifying investment that is not permitted to be received without the recognition of gain, then, for purposes of this section, the receipt of the property is treated in a similar manner as the receipt of such property or boot in a recapitalization. Paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section applies to property to which section 301 applies. Paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) of this section applies to boot to which section 356(a) or (c) applies.
