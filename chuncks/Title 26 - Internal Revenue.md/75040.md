(2)The following questions and answers provide guidance on the exercise of due diligence for an exception to a penalty under sections 6721 through 6723 for a failure to provide a correct TIN on any information return (as defined in § 301.6721-1(g)), payee statement (as defined in § 301.6722-1(d)), document (as described in § 301.6723-1(a)(4)), or the failure merely to provide a TIN as described in § 301.6723-1(a)(4)(ii).

Q-1. Is a payor subject to a penalty for a failure to provide a correct TIN on an information return with respect to a reportable interest or dividend payment if the payee has certified, under penalties of perjury, that the TIN furnished to the payor is the payee's correct number, the payor provided that number on an information return, and the number is later determined not to be the payee's correct number?

A-1. A payor is not subject to a penalty for failure to provide the payee's correct TIN on an information return, if the payee has certified, under penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided to the payor was his correct number, and the payor included such number on the information return before being notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (or a broker) that the number is incorrect.

Q-2. In order for a payor of a reportable interest or dividend payment (other than in a window transaction) to be considered to have exercised due diligence in furnishing the correct TIN of a payee with respect to an account opened or an instrument acquired after December 31, 1983, what actions must the payor take?
