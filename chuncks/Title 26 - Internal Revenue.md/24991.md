####### Advance payment cost offset method,In general.

(e)-(1)This paragraph (e) provides an optional method of accounting for advance payments from the sale of inventory (advance payment cost offset method). A taxpayer that chooses to use the advance payment cost offset method for a trade or business must use the method of accounting for all advance payments received by that trade or business that meet the criteria in this paragraph (e). Additionally, a taxpayer that chooses to use this method for a trade or business and that has an AFS must also use the AFS cost offset method described in ยง 1.451-3(c). A taxpayer that uses the AFS cost offset method and the advance payment cost offset method to account for gross income, including advance payments, from the sale of an item of inventory, determines the corresponding AFS income inclusion amount, as defined in ยง 1.451-3(a)(1), and the advance payment income inclusion amount for a taxable year by following the rules in ยง 1.451-3(c)(2) rather than the rules under this paragraph (e). However, if all payments received for the sale of item of inventory meet the definition of an advance payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a taxpayer that uses the advance payment cost offset method determines the corresponding advance payment income inclusion amount for a taxable year by:

(i) Following the rules in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, subject to the additional rules and limitations in paragraphs (e)(5) through (8) of this section, if the taxable year is a taxable year prior to the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer; and

(ii) Following the rules in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, subject to the additional rules and limitations in paragraphs (e)(5) through (8) of this section, if the taxable year is the taxable year in which ownership of the item of inventory is transferred to the customer.
