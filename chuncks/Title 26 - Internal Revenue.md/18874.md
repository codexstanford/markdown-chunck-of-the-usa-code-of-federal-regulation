####### Election not to restore full value.

(ii)(A) A loss corporation may elect to reduce the amount of value restored from a foreign component member (the electing foreign component member) to another component member under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the form set forth in this paragraph (h)(2)(ii). It must be filed by the loss corporation by including a statement on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs). The common parent of a consolidated group must make the election on behalf of the group. The election is made in the form of a statement entitled, "STATEMENT PURSUANT TO ยง 1.382-8(h)(2)(ii) TO ELECT NOT TO RESTORE FULL VALUE OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF ELECTING FOREIGN COMPONENT MEMBER] TO [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE CORPORATION TO WHICH SUCH VALUE IS NOT TO BE RESTORED]." The statement must include the amount of the value not being restored and must also indicate that an agreement signed and dated by both parties, as described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, has been entered into. Each such party must retain either the original or a copy of the agreement as part of its records. See ยง 1.6001-1(e).

(B) An electing foreign component member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made. If the electing foreign component member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing foreign component member (or United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.
