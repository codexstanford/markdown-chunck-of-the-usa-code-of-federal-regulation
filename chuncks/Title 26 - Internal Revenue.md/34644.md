####### iii,Example 26

() If, for example, state A taxable income were determined to equal $550,000x, then $550,000x of U.S. source income for Federal income tax purposes would be presumed to constitute state A taxable income. Under paragraph (g)(26) of this section (), the remaining $250,000x ($800,000x-$550,000x) of U.S. source income for Federal income tax purposes would be presumed to be subject to tax in states B and C. Since states B and C impose tax on $400,000x, the application of Example 25 would result in a presumption that $150,000x is foreign source income and $250,000x is domestic source income. The deduction for the $14,000x of income taxes of states B and C would therefore be related and allocable to both foreign source and domestic source income and would be subject to apportionment.
