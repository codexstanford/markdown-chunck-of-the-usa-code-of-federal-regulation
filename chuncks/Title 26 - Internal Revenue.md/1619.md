####### Annualization of first-year and last-year qualified carbon oxide emission and/or capture amounts,In general.

(3)-(i)For both the taxable year in which carbon capture equipment is placed in service at a qualified facility and the taxable year in which the 12-year period described in sections 45Q(a)(3)(A) and (4)(A) and § 1.45Q-1(c)(1) and (2) ends, annualization of the amount of qualified carbon oxide emitted and captured (or captured directly from the ambient air in the case of a direct air capture facility) is permitted to determine if the threshold requirements under paragraph (g)(1) of this section are satisfied. Such annualization may result in a facility being deemed to satisfy the threshold requirements under paragraph (g)(1) of this section for the year and may permit a taxpayer to claim section 45Q credits even though the amount of qualified carbon oxide emitted or captured in the first year or last year of the 12-year period is less than the threshold requirements under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
