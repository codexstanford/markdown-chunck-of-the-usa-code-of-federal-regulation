####### Reporting of wages.

(3)Forms 941, 942, and 943 each require, as a part of the return, that the wages of each employee paid during the period covered by the return be reported thereon. Form 941a is available to employers who need additional space for the listing of employees. Employers who meet the requirements of the Social Security Administration may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, submit wage information on reels of magnetic tape in lieu of Form 941a. It is necessary at times that employers correct wage information previously reported. A special form, Form 941c, has been adopted for use in correcting erroneous wage information or omissions of such wage information on Form 941, 942, or 943. Instructions on Form 941, 941c, 942, and 943 explain the manner of preparing and filing the forms. Any further instructions should be obtained from the district director.
