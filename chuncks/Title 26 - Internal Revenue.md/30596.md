(5) Section 631(c)(2) results in the denial of section 631(c) treatment in the case of a contract for disposal of iron ore entered into with a person owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same interests which own or control the person disposing of the iron ore, even though section 631(c) treatment would not be denied under the provisions of section 631(c)(1). For example, section 631(c) treatment is denied in the case of a contract for disposal of iron ore entered into between twocorporations, or a parent corporation and its subsidiary. The presence or absence of control shall be determined by applying the same standards as are applied under section 482 (relating to the allocation of income and deductions between taxpayers).
