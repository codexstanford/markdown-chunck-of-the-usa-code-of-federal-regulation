(6)The facts are the same as inin paragraph (e)(5) of this section, except PR completes its submission of information to support a request for modification on July 1, 2025, but does not execute a waiver pursuant to ยง 301.6231-1(b)(2). Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, February 27, 2026, the date the period requesting modification expires, is the date on which everything required to be submitted pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted. As a result, the 270-day period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section expires on November 24, 2026. Because November 24, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (April 28, 2026), November 24, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
