####### Special rules for acquisition of a trade or business (Prior to the Revenue Act of 1987 and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988),In general.

(4)-(i)Under section 355(b)(2)(C), a trade or business relied upon to meet the requirements of section 355(b) must not have been acquired by the distributing corporation, the controlled corporation, or another member of the affiliated group during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution unless it was acquired in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized. Similarly, under section 355(b)(2)(D), the trade or business must not have been indirectly acquired by any of those corporations (or a predecessor in interest of any of those corporations) during that five-year period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part and which consisted of the acquisition of control of the corporation directly engaged in the trade or business, or the indirect acquisition of control of that corporation through the direct or indirect acquisition of control of one or more other corporations. A trade or business acquired, directly or indirectly, within the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution in a transaction in which the basis of the assets acquired was not determined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor's basis does not qualify under section 355(b)(2), even though no gain or loss was recognized by the transferor.
