####### Rules for computation of tax.

(c)(1) The first step in determining whether either of the limitations described in section 481(b) (1) or (2) applies is to compute the increase in tax for the taxable year of the change that is attributable to the increase in taxable income for such year resulting solely from the adjustments required under section 481(a) and ยง 1.481-1. This increase in tax is the excess of the tax for the taxable year computed by taking into account such adjustments under section 481(a) over the tax computed for such year without taking the adjustments into account.

(2) The next step is to compute under section 481(b)(1) the tax attributable to the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the taxable year of the change and the two preceding taxable years as if an amount equal to one-third of the net amount of such adjustments had been received or accrued in each of such taxable years. The increase in tax attributable to the adjustments for each such taxable year is the excess of the tax for such year computed with the allocation of one-third of the net adjustments to such taxable year over the tax computed without the allocation of any part of the adjustments to such year. For the purpose of computing the aggregate increase in taxes for such taxable years, there shall be taken into account the increase or decrease in tax for any taxable year preceding the taxable year of the change to which no adjustment is allocated under section 481(b)(1) but which is affected by a net operating loss under section 172 or by a capital loss carryback or carryover under section 1212, determined with reference to taxable years with respect to which adjustments under section 481(b)(1) are allocated.

(3) In the event that the taxpayer satisfies the conditions set forth in section 481(b)(2), the next step is to determine the amount of the net increase in tax attributable to the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for:

(i) The taxable year of the change,

(ii) The consecutive taxable year or years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change for which the taxpayer can establish his taxable income under the new method of accounting, and

(iii) Any taxable year preceding the taxable year of the change to which no adjustment is allocated under section 481(b)(2), but which is affected by a net operating loss or by a capital loss carryback or carryover determined with reference to taxable years with respect to which such adjustments are allocated.

(4) The tax for the taxable year of the change shall be the tax for such year, computed without taking any of the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into account, increased by the smallest of the following amounts-

(i) The amount of tax for the taxable year of the change attributable solely to taking into account the entire amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) and ยง 1.481-1;

(ii) The sum of the increases in tax liability for the taxable year of the change and the two immediately preceding taxable years that would have resulted solely from taking into account one-third of the amount of such adjustments required for each of such years as though such amounts had been properly attributable to such years (computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section); or

(iii) The net increase in tax attributable to allocating such adjustments under the new method of accounting (computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section).

(5)(i) In the case of a change in method of accounting by a partnership, the adjustments required by section 481 shall be made with respect to the taxable income of the partnership but the limitations on tax under section 481(b) shall apply to the individual partners. Each partner shall take into account his distributive share of the partnership items, as so adjusted, for the taxable year of the change. Section 481(b) applies to a partner whose taxable income is so increased by more than $3,000 as a result of such adjustments to the partnership taxable income. It is not necessary for the partner to have been a member of the partnership for the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of the partnership's accounting method in order to have the limitation provided by section 481(b)(1) apply. Further, a partner may apply section 481(b)(2) even though he was not a member of the partnership for all the taxable years affected by the computation thereunder.

(ii) In the case of a change in method of accounting by an electing small business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the adjustments required by section 481 shall be made with respect to the taxable income of such electing corporation in the year of the change, but the limitations on tax under section 481(b) shall apply to the individual shareholders. Section 481(b) applies to a shareholder of an electing small business corporation whose taxable income is so increased by more than $3,000 as a result of such adjustments to such corporation's taxable income. It is not necessary for the shareholder to have been a member of the electing small business corporation, or for such corporation to have been an electing small business corporation, for the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of the corporation's accounting method in order to have the limitation provided by section 481(b)(1) apply. Further, a shareholder may apply section 481(b)(2), even though he was not a shareholder, or the corporation was not an electing small business corporation, for all the taxable years affected by the computation thereunder.

(6) For the purpose of the successive computations of the limitations on tax under section 481(b) (1) or (2), if the treatment of any item under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws) depends upon the amount of gross income, adjusted gross income, or taxable income (for example, medical expenses, charitable contributions, or credits against the tax), such item shall be determined for the purpose of each such computation by taking into account the proper portion of the amount of any adjustments required to be taken into account under section 481 in each such computation.

(7) The increase or decrease in the tax for any taxable year for which an assessment of any deficiency, or a credit or refund of any overpayment, is prevented by any law or rule of law, shall be determined by reference to the tax previously determined (within the meaning section 1314(a) for such year.

(8) In applying section 7807(b)(1), the provisions of chapter 1 (other than subchapter E, relating to tax on self-employment income) and chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be treated as the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
