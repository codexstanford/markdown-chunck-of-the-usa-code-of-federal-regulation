###### Constructive addition if liability is not paid out of trust principal.

(C)Where a trust described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is relieved of any liability properly payable out of the assets of such trust, the person or entity who actually satisfies the liability is considered to have made a constructive addition to the trust in an amount equal to the liability. The constructive addition occurs when the trust is relieved of liability (e.g., when the right of recovery is no longer enforceable). But see ยง 26.2652-1(a)(3) for rules involving the application of section 2207A in the case of an election under section 2652(a)(3).
