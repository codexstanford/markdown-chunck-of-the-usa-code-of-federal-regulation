####### Modification of business interest income for partnerships.

(1)The business interest income of a partnership generally is determined in accordance with ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(4). However, to the extent that interest income of a partnership that is properly allocable to trades or businesses that are per se non-passive activities is allocated to partners that do not materially participate (within the meaning of section 469), as described in ยง 1.469-1T(e)(6) and subject to section 163(d)(5)(A)(ii), such interest income shall not be considered business interest income for purposes of determining the section 163(j) limitation of a partnership pursuant to ยง 1.163(j)-2(b). A per se non-passive activity is an activity that is not treated as a passive activity for purposes of section 469 regardless of whether the owners of the activity materially participate in the activity.
