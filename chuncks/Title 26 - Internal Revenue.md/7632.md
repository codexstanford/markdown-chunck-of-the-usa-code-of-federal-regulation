(v)-(A)A debt used to pay for qualified medical or educational expenses is refinanced if some or all of the outstanding balance of the debt (the "original debt") is repaid out of the proceeds of a second debt (the "replacement debt"). If, in the year of a refinancing, the combined qualified indebtedness of the original debt and the replacement debt exceeds the combined qualified expenses of such debts, the amount of qualified indebtedness for each such debt shall be determined by multiplying the amount of qualified indebtedness for each such debt by a fraction, the numerator of which is the combined qualified expenses and the denominator of which is the combined qualified indebtedness.
