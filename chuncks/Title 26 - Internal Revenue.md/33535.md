####### Segregated asset accounts.

(4)For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1967, pursuant to the provisions of section 801(g):

(i) A foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business which issues contracts based on segregated asset accounts shall separately compute in a manner consistent with this subparagraph the adjustment (if any) under section 819 to the amount of policy and other contract liability requirements and the amount of required interest properly attributable to each of such segregated asset accounts. The "minimum figure" used in section 819 in making the adjustment with respect to each of the segregated asset accounts shall be computed as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in lieu of the manner provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph.

(ii) The minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is the amount determined by multiplying the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business attributable to such a segregated asset account, by 1 percent.

(iii) The minimum figure as computed under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be compared only with the surplus held in the United States attributable to each segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Such surplus is the excess of assets held in the United States properly attributable to such segregated asset account over the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business properly attributable to such account.

(iv) If the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such other accounts, for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the company's overall excess, as defined in this subdivision. No adjustment under section 819 or this paragraph shall be made with respect to any account if there is no such overall excess. For purposes of this subdivision and of subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, the term "overall excess" means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts plus the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to the company's entire U.S. life insurance business, including segregated asset accounts as well as other accounts.

(v) In the case of a company which issues contracts based on one or more than one segregated asset account, if the minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, then for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the account limitation figure, as defined in this subdivision. Therefore, no adjustment under section 819 or under this subparagraph shall be made with respect to any segregated asset account if the aggregate of the account limitation figures is zero, but nothing in this subdivision shall preclude an adjustment under section 819 with respect to accounts other than segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "account limitation figure" is a segregated assets account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures. Such aggregate of the account limitation figures is equal to the lesser of either the company's overall excess as defined in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, or the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of the minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to all such segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, a segregated asset account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures is determined by multiplying the amount of such aggregate of account limitation figures by a percentage, the numerator of which is the amount by which the minimum figure applicable to such account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the amounts by which the minimum figure applicable to each segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account.

(vi) Subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
