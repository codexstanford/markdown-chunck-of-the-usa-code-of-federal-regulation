###### ยง 1.584-4 Admission and withdrawal of participants in the common trust fund.
####### Gain or loss.

(a)The common trust fund realizes no gain or loss by the admission or withdrawal of a participant, and the basis of the assets and the period for which they are deemed to have been held by the common trust fund for the purposes of section 1202 are unaffected by such an admission or withdrawal. For taxable years of participants ending after April 7, 1976, and for transfers occurring after that date, the transfer of property by a participant to a common trust fund is treated as a sale or exchange of the property transferred. If a participant withdraws the whole or any part of its participating interest from the common trust fund, such withdrawal shall be treated as a sale or exchange by the participant of the participating interest or portion thereof which is so withdrawn. A participant is not deemed to have withdrawn any part of its participating interest in the common trust fund so as to have completed a closed transaction by reason of the segregation and administration of an investment of the fund, pursuant to the provisions of 12 CFR 9.18(b)(7) (or, for periods before September 28, 1962, 12 CFR206.17(c)(7)), for the benefit of all the then participants in the common trust fund. Such segregated investment shall be considered as held by, or on behalf of, the common trust fund for the benefit ratably of all participants in the common trust fund at the time of segregation, and any income or loss arising from its administration and liquidation shall constitute income or loss to the common trust fund apportionable among the participants for whose benefit the investment was segregated. When a participating interest is transferred by a bank, or by two or more banks that are members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504), as a result of the combination of two or more common trust funds or the division of a single common trust fund, the transfer to the surviving or divided fund is not considered to be an admission or a withdrawal if the combining, dividing, and resulting common trust funds have diversified portfolios. For purposes of this paragraph (a), a common trust fund has a diversified portfolio if it satisfies the 25 and 50-percent tests of section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii), applying the relevant provisions of section 368(a)(2)(F). However, Government securities are included in total assets for purposes of the denominator of the 25 and 50-percent tests (unless the Government securities are acquired to meet the 25 and 50-percent tests), but are not treated as securities of an issuer for purposes of the numerator of the 25 and 50-percent tests. In addition, for a transfer of a participating interest in a division of a common trust fund not to be considered an admission or withdrawal, each participant's pro ratainterest in each of the resulting common trust funds must be substantially the same as was the participant's pro rata interest in the dividing fund. However, in the case of the division of a common trust fund maintained by two or more banks that are members of the same affiliated group resulting from the termination of such affiliation, the division will be treated as meeting the requirements of the preceding sentence if the written plans of operation of the resulting common trust funds are substantially identical to the plan of operation of the dividing common trust fund, each of the assets of the dividing common trust fund are distributed substantially pro rata to each of the resulting common trust funds, and each participant's aggregate interest in the assets of the resulting common trust funds of which he or she is a participant is substantially the same as was the participant's pro rata interest in the assets of the dividing common trust fund. The plan of operation of a resulting common trust fund will not be considered to be substantially identical to that of the dividing common trust fund where, for example, the plan of operation of the resulting common trust fund contains restrictions as to the types of participants that may invest in the common trust fund where such restrictions were not present in the plan of operation of the dividing common trust fund.
