If there is an arrearage in dividends for prior taxable years with respect to more than one class of preferred stock, the previous sentence is applied to each class in order of priority, except that the accumulated earnings and profits remaining after the applicable date are reduced by the allocable earnings and profits necessary to satisfy arrearages with respect to classes of stock with a higher priority. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(iii), the amount of any arrearage with respect to stock described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section is determined in the same manner as the present value of unpaid current dividends on such stock under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.
