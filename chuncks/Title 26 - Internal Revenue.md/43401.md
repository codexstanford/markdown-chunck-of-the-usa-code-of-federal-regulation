####### Application of 50-percent test.

(xi)The 50-percent test described in this subparagraph is applied on an item-by-item basis. If, however, a DISC sells a substantial volume of substantially identical products or commodities and if all or a group of such products or commodities contain substantially identical depletable products in substantially the same proportions and have cost or fair market value relationships (as the case may be) that are in substantially the same proportions, such DISC may apply the 50-percent test on an aggregate basis with respect to all such products or commodities, or group, as the case may be.
