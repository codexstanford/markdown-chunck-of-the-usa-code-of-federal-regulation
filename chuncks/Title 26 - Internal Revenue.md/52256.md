(v)This paragraph (f)(6) applies to gain or loss taken into account on or after July 12, 1995, and to transactions occurring on or after July 12, 1995. For example, if S sells P stock to B at a loss prior to July 12, 1995, and B sells the P stock to a nonmember after July 12, 1995, S's loss is disallowed because it is taken into account after July 12, 1995. If a taxpayer takes a gain or loss into account or engages in a transaction on or after July 12, 1995, during a tax year ending prior to December 31, 1995, the taxpayer may treat the gain or loss or the transaction under the rules published in 1995-32 I.R.B. 47, instead of under the rules of this paragraph (f)(6).
