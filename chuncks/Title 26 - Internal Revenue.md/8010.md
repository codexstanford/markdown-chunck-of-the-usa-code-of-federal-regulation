####### Analysis.

(ii)Because the $20x of interest expense is not properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business, and therefore is not business interest expense, C's only business interest expense is the $30x that C pays on the loan used to purchase sedans for sale in C's dealership trade or business. C deducts the $20x of interest related to his residence under the rules of section 163(h), without regard to section 163(j).
