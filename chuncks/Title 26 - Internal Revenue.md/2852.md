####### Reasonably estimated life.

(2)The reasonably estimated life of an acquired policy is determined based on the facts with respect to each policy (such as the age, sex, and health of the insured), and the company's experience (such as mortality, lapse rate and renewals) with similar policies. A company may treat as the reasonably estimated life of an acquired policy the period for amortizing expenses of the acquired policy that would be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) at the time the acquisition expenses are incurred. If the FASB has not established such a period, the period for amortizing acquisition expense of an acquired policy under guidelines issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in effect at the time the acquisition expenses are incurred may be treated as the reasonably estimated life of the acquired policy.
