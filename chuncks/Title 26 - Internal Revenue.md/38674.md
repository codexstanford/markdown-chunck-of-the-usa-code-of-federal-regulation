###### ยง 1.904(g)-3 Ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses.
####### Step Eight: Dispositions under section 904(f)(3) in which gain would not otherwise be recognized.

(i)The taxpayer determines the amount of gain that would otherwise not be recognized but that must be recognized in accordance with ยง 1.904(f)-2(d)(4) (not exceeding the taxpayer's applicable overall foreign loss account) and then applies ยง 1.904(f)-2(a) and (b) to recapture and reduce its overall foreign loss accounts in an amount equal to the gain recognized. To the extent this recognition of gain in a taxable year reduces the amount of a current year net operating loss or increases the amount of a net operating loss carryover to that taxable year, paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section are applied to determine the allocation of any additional net operating loss deduction and other deductions or losses and the applicable increases in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss, separate limitation loss, and overall domestic loss accounts, but only after the applicable overall foreign loss account has been recaptured as provided in this paragraph (i).
