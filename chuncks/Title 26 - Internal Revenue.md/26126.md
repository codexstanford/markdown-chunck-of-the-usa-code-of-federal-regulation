(iv)For purposes of section 6601 and section 6611, the income tax return for each taxable year of the qualified settlement fund to which the election applies is due on March 15 of the year following the taxable year of the fund. For taxable years of a qualified settlement fund ending prior to January 1, 1993, the income earned by the fund is deemed to have been earned on December 31 of each taxable year for purposes of section 6655. Thus, the addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 6655 will not be imposed. The penalty for failure to file a return under section 6651(a)(1), the penalty for failure to pay tax under section 6651(a)(2), the penalty for failure to make deposit of taxes under section 6656, and the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 will not be imposed on a qualified settlement fund if the fund files its tax returns for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1993, and pays any tax due for those taxable years, on or before March 15, 1993.
