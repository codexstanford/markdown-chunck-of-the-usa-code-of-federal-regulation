####### Analysis.

(B)The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X and Y carried under section 381(c)(20) to Z's taxable year ending December 31, 2022, is $750x. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only $84x of the aggregate amount ($500x x (61/365) = $84x) may be deducted by Z in that year. Moreover, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this amount only may be deducted by Z in that year after Z has deducted its $100x of current-year business interest expense (as defined in ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)).
