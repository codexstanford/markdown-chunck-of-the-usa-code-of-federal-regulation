(H)-()The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(G)() of this section (the facts in) except that the rate of the Base Erosion Tax is 20% and the rate of the Income Tax is 25%. Accordingly, if CFC claims the 100u of excess deductions its liability for Base Erosion Tax would be 20u (.20 x 100u), and its liability for Income Tax would be 75u (.25 x 300u). If CFC chooses not to claim the 100u of excess deductions its liability for Base Erosion Tax would be zero, and its liability for Income Tax would be 100u (.25 x 400u).
