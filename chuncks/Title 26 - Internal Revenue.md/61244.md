(B)If the activities connected with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are conducted during the current taxable year by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and in other countries, then a percentage of the intangible (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of all such activities worldwide.
