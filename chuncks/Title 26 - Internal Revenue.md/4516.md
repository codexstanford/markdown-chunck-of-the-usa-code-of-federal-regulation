###### ยง 1.103-10 Exemption for certain small issues of industrial development bonds.
####### In general.

(a)Section 103(b)(6) applies to certain industrial development bond issues (referred to in this section as "exempt small issues") and bonds issued to refund certain issues (referred to in this section as "exempt small refunding issues"). If an issue is an exempt small issue or an exempt small refunding issue, then under the requirements of section 103(b)(6) and this section the interest paid on the debt obligations is not includable in gross income, and the obligations are treated as obligations described in section 103(a)(1) and ยง 1.103-1, even though such obligations are industrial development bonds as defined in section 103(b)(2) and ยง 1.103-7. However, interest on an obligation of such an issue is includable in gross income if the obligation is held by a substantial user of the financed facilities or a related person (as described in section 103(b)(7) and ยง 1.103-11). Section 103(b)(6) only becomes applicable where the bond issue meets both the trade or business and the security interest tests so that the obligations are industrial development bonds within the meaning of section 103(b)(2). For bonds issued before January 1, 1979, in taxable years ending before such date, and for capital expenditures made before January 1, 1979, with respect to such bonds, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be applied by substituting $5 million for $10 million.
