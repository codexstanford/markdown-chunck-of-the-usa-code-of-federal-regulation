####### General rule.

(ii)In determining whether a person has acquired by purchase a 50 percent or greater interest under section 355(d)(4), an option to acquire stock (as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (vi) of this section) that has not been exercised when a distribution occurs is treated as exercised on the date it was issued or most recently transferred if-

(A) Its exercise (whether by itself or in conjunction with the deemed exercise of one or more other options) would cause a person to become a disqualified person; and

(B) Immediately after the distribution, it is reasonably certain (as described in paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section) that the option will be exercised.
