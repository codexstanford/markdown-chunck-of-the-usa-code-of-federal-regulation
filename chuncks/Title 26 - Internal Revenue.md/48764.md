()A trade or business is formed or organized under the laws of the jurisdiction within which a qualified opportunity zone is located, and the business has a P.O. Box located in the qualified opportunity zone. The mail received at that P.O. Box is fundamental to the income of the trade or business, but there is no other basis for concluding that the income of the trade or business is derived from activities in the qualified opportunity zone. The mere location of the P.O. Box is not necessary for the generation of gross income by the trade or business.
