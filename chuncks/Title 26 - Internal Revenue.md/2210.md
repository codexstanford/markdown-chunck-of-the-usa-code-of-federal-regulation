##### rules for computing credit for investment in certain depreciable property
###### ยง 1.47-3 Exceptions to the application of ยง 1.47-1.
####### Certain property replaced after April 18, 1969,In general.

(h)-(1)(i) If section 38 property is disposed of and property which is, for purposes of section 1033 and the regulations thereunder, similar or related in service or use to the property disposed of and which would be section 38 property but for the application of section 49 is placed in service to replace the property disposed of, the increase in income tax and adjustment of investment credit carryovers and carrybacks resulting from the recomputation under paragraph (a) of ยง 1.47-1 shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the credit that would be allowed for the qualified investment of the replacement property (determined as if such property were section 38 property). The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the replacement takes place within 6 months after the disposition. If property otherwise qualifies as replacement property, it is immaterial that it is placed in service (for example, to undergo testing) before the replaced property is disposed of. The assignment by the taxpayer in his return of an estimated useful life to the replacement property in computing its qualified investment will be considered a representation by the taxpayer that he expects to retain the replacement property for its entire estimated useful life. If such property is disposed of before the end of such life, then the circumstances surrounding the replacement will be examined to determine whether the taxpayer's representation was in good faith and, if appropriate, the qualified investment of the replacement property will be recomputed for the year of replacement using the actual useful life of such property.

(ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
