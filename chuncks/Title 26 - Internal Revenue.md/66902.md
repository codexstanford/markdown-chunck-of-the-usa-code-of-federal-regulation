(3) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.

(4) If one or more members of a partnership withdraw, or if new partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.

(6) A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:

(ii) A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or partnership; or
