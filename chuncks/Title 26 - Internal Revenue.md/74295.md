###### ยง 301.6362-3 Qualified resident tax which is a percentage of Federal tax.
####### Method of making adjustments.

(c)Except as specifically provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1) of this section and in paragraph (c)(2) of ยง 301.6362-4, no account shall be taken of any reduction or increase in the Federal adjusted gross income which would result from the exclusion from, or inclusion in, gross income of the items which are the subject of the adjustments provided in those paragraphs. Thus, for example, when for purposes of the calculation the taxpayer's Federal income tax liability is adjusted to reflect the exclusion from gross income of interest on obligations of the United States, no change shall be made in the amount of the taxpayer's deduction for medical expenses, or in the amount of his charitable contribution base, even though such amounts would ordinarily depend upon the amount of adjusted gross income. Also, when calculating the adjusted Federal tax liability to which the rate of the State tax is to be applied, no adjustment shall be made in the amount of any credit against Federal tax to which a taxpayer is entitled.
