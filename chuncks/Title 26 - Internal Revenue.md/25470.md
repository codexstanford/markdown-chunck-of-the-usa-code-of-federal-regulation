####### Redetermination of tax liability.

(ii)Under the method described in this paragraph (c)(3) (actual method), a taxpayer first must determine what its regular and, when applicable, its alternative minimum tax and base erosion minimum tax liability would have been for each redetermination year if the amounts of contract income allocated in Step One for all contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year and in any prior year were substituted for the amounts of contract income reported under the percentage of completion method on the taxpayer's original return (or as subsequently adjusted on examination, or by amended return). See Example 2 of paragraph (h)(3) for an illustration of Step Two.
