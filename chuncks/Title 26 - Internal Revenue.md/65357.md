###### ยง 31.6053-1 Report of tips by employee to employer.
####### Regularly used forms.

(iii)Instead of requiring that tips be reported as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on a special form used solely for tip reporting, an employer may prescribe regularly used forms for use by employees in reporting tips. A regularly used form may be on paper or in electronic form (such as a time card or report), must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, must contain identifying information that will ensure accurate identification of the employee by the employer, and is permitted to be used only if the employer furnishes the employee a statement suitable for retention showing the amount of tips reported by the employee for the period. The employer statement may be furnished when the employee reports the tips, when wages are first paid following the reporting of tips by the employee, or within a short time after the wages are paid. The employer may meet this requirement, for example, through the use of a payroll check stub or other payroll document regularly furnished (if not less frequent than monthly) by the employer to the employee showing gross pay and deductions.
