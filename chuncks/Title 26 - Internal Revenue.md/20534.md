###### ยง 1.401(a)(26)-4 Testing former employees.
####### Exception.

(2)Solely for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the rule in ยง 1.401(a)(26)-6(c)(4) (regarding vested accrued benefits eligible for mandatory distribution) does not apply to any former employee having a vested accrued benefit. Thus, a former employee who has a vested accrued benefit is not an excludable former employee merely because that vested accrued benefit does not exceed the cash-out limit in effect under ยง 1.411(a)-11(c)(3)(ii).
