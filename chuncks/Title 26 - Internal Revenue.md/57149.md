####### Multiple payments.

(ii)If multiple payments are made to satisfy bail reportable under this section and the initial payment does not exceed $10,000, the initial payment and subsequent payments must be aggregated and the information return required by this section must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the 15th day after receipt of the payment that causes the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000. However, if payments are made to satisfy separate bail requirements, no aggregation is required. Thus, if in Month 1 a clerk receives $6,000 in bail for an individual charged with a specified criminal offense and later, in Month 2, receives $7,000 in bail for that same individual charged with another specified criminal offense, no aggregation is required.
