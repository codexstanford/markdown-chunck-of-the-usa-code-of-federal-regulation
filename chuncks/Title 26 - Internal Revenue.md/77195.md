(b)After the returns are filed and processed in internal revenue service centers, some returns are selected for examination. If adjustments are proposed with which the taxpayer does not agree, ordinarily the taxpayer is afforded certain appeal rights. If the taxpayer agrees to the proposed adjustments and the tax involved is an income, profits, estate, gift, generation-skipping transfer, or Chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44, tax, and if the taxpayer waives restrictions on the assessment and collection of the tax (see ยง 601.105(b)(4)), the deficiency will be immediately assessed.
