### Subchapter A - Income Tax

##### Administrative Provisions and Other Rules
###### ยง 1.1502-92 Ownership change of a loss group or a loss subgroup.
####### Scope.

(1)This paragraph (c) contains a supplemental rule for determining whether there is an ownership change of a loss group (or loss subgroup). It applies in addition to, and not instead of, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, for example, if the common parent of the loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b) of this section, the loss group has an ownership change even if, by applying this paragraph (c), the common parent would not have an ownership change. This paragraph (c) does not apply in determining an ownership change of a loss subgroup for which an election under ยง 1.1502-91(d)(4) is made.
