####### Joint owners.

(ii)Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under this paragraph (c) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.
