###### ยง 1.584-4 Admission and withdrawal of participants in the common trust fund.
####### Basis for gain or loss upon withdrawal.

(b)The participant's gain or loss upon withdrawal of its participating interest or portion thereof shall be measured by the difference between the amount received upon such withdrawal and the adjusted basis of the participating interest or portion thereof withdrawn plus the additions prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section and minus the reductions prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. The amount received by the participant shall be the sum of any money plus the fair market value of property (other than money) received upon such withdrawal. The basis of the participating interest or portion thereof withdrawn shall be the sum of any money plus the fair market value of any property (other than money) contributed by the participant to the common trust fund to acquire the participating interest or portion thereof withdrawn. Such basis shall not be reduced on account of the segregation of any investment in the common trust fund pursuant to the provisions of 12 CFR 9.18(b)(7) (or, for periods before September 28, 1962, 12 CFR 206.17(c)(7)). For the purpose of making the adjustments, additions, and reductions with respect to basis as prescribed in this paragraph, the ward, rather than the guardian, shall be deemed to be the participant; and the grantor, rather than the trust, shall be deemed to be the participant, to the extent that the income of the trust is taxable to the grantor under subpart E (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code.
