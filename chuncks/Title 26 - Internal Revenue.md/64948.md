###### ยง 31.3406(d)-3 Special 30-day rules for certain reportable payments.
####### Sale of an instrument for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail.

(b)The special rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section apply comparably with respect to certification of the taxpayer identification number for the sale of an instrument under section 6045 (as described in ยง 31.3406(b)(3)-2) through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in ยง 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail. However, the 30-day rules may apply only if the payee furnishes the payee's taxpayer identification number before the sale occurs. For purposes of applying the 30-day rules under this paragraph (b), a payee's reinvestment of the gross proceeds of the sale into other instruments constitutes a withdrawal.
