###### ยง 1.937-3 Income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in a possession.
####### In general.

(b)Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the principles of section 864(c) and the regulations under that section (relating to the determination of income, gain or loss that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States) generally will be applied in determining whether income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the relevant possession, without regard to whether the taxpayer qualifies as a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation with respect to such possession. Subject to the rules of this section, the principles of section 864(c)(4) will apply for purposes of determining whether income from sources without the relevant possession is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the relevant possession. For purposes of the preceding sentence, all income other than income from sources within the relevant possession (as determined under the rules of ยง 1.937-2) will be considered income from sources without the relevant possession in the application of the principles of section 864(c) under this paragraph (b), it generally will be sufficient to substitute the name of the relevant possession for the term "United States" where appropriate, but additional substitutions may be necessary to accomplish the intent of section 937(b) and this section. In no case, however, will a bona fide resident or other person have, as a result of the application of these principles, more income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the relevant possession than the amount of U.S. effectively connected income that a similarly situated U.S. person who is not a bona fide resident would have under section 864(c).
