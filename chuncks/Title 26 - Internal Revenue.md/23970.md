####### Effect of range certification before certification of specific percentage.

(B)If a plan's enrolled actuary issues a range certification pursuant to this paragraph (h)(4)(ii), then, for purposes of this section (including application of the limitations of sections 436(b) and (c), contributions described in sections 436(b)(2), 436(c)(2), and 436(e)(2), and the mandatory reduction of the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under paragraph (a)(5) of this section), the plan is treated as having a certified percentage at the smallest value within the applicable range until a certification of the plan's specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year has been issued under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. However, if the plan's enrolled actuary has issued a range certification for the plan year but does not issue a certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan by the last day of that plan year, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan is retroactively deemed to be less than 60 percent as of the first day of the 10th month of the plan year.
