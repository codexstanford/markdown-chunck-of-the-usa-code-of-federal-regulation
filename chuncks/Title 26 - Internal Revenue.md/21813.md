() If the plan before the amendment offers neither a single-sum distribution option as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B)() of this section nor a joint and contingent annuity with a continuation percentage as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B)() of this section, a plan is permitted to treat a term certain and life annuity with a term certain period no less than 15 years as the most valuable option for a participant with a short life expectancy for each annuity starting date if such 15-year term certain and life annuity is available at all annuity starting dates, without regard to whether the option was available before the plan amendment.
