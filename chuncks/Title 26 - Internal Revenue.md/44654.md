####### Example 2: Installment sale gain.

(ii)On December 22, 2021, A disposed of A's API in an installment sale. At the time of the disposition, A had held its API for two years. A received a payment with respect to the installment sale during A's 2022 taxable year causing A to recognize $200 of long-term capital gain. The $200 long-term capital gain recognized in 2022 is subject to section 1061 because it is recognized after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, the $200 of long-term capital gain recognized by A in 2022 is included in A's API One Year Disposition Amount. The $200 of long-term capital gain is not in A's API Three Year Disposition Amount because the API was not held for more than three years at the time of its disposition.
