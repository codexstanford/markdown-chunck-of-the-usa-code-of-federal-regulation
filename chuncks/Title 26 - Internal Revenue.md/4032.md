####### Amounts received as an annuity.

(a)(1) Section 72(d) provides a special rule for the treatment of amounts received as an annuity by an employee (or by the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee) under a contract to which section 72 applies. This special rule is applicable only in the event that:

(i) At least part of the consideration paid for the contract is contributed by the employer, and

(ii) The aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under such contract by the employee (or by his beneficiary or beneficiaries if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity under the contract) within the 3-year period beginning on the date (whether or not before January 1, 1954) on which an amount is first received as an annuity equals or exceeds the total consideration contributed (or deemed contributed under section 72(f) and § 1.72-8) by the employee as of such date as reduced by all amounts previously received and excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law.

(2) If the aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under the contract within three years from the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity thereunder will not equal or exceed the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee in accordance with the provisions of § 1.72-8, computed as of such date, the special rule of section 72(d) shall not apply to amounts received as an annuity under the contract and the general rules of section 72 shall apply thereto.

(3) The aggregate of the amounts receivable as an annuity within the prescribed 3-year period shall be the total of all annuity payments anticipatable by an employee (or a beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee, if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity) under the contract as a whole as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.72-2. See paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.72-2 for rules for determining what constitutes "the contract" in the case of distributions from an employees' trust or plan.

(4) If subparagraphs (1) and (3) of this paragraph apply to amounts received as an annuity under a contract, the rule prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply to all amounts so received thereunder regardless of the fact that they may be payable (i) to more than one beneficiary, (ii) for the same or different intervals, (iii) in different sums, or (iv) for a different period certain, life, or lives.

(5) For purposes of section 72(d), contributions which are made with respect to a self-employed individual and which are allowed as a deduction under section 404(a) are not considered contributions by the employee, but such contributions are considered contributions by the employer. A contribution which is deemed paid in a prior taxable year under the provisions of section 404(a)(6) shall be considered made with respect to a self-employed individual if the individual on whose behalf the contribution is made was self-employed for the taxable year in which the contribution is deemed paid, whether or not such individual is self-employed at the time the contribution is actually paid. Contributions with respect to a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for such owner-employee shall not be treated as consideration for the contract contributed by the employee in computing the employee contributions for purposes of section 72(d).
