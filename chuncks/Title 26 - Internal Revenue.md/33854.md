####### Definition of capital gain dividend,General rule.

(c)-(1)A capital gain dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C), is any dividend or part thereof which is designated by a regulated investment company as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders within the period specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to the taxable year (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 855) is greater than the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For example, a regulated investment company making its return on the calendar year basis advised its shareholders by written notice mailed December 30, 1955, that of a distribution of $500,000 made December 15, 1955, $200,000 constituted a capital gain dividend, amounting to $2 per share. It was later discovered that an error had been made in determining the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the taxable year, and that such excess was $100,000 instead of $200,000. In such case each shareholder would have received a capital gain dividend of $1 per share instead of $2 per share.
