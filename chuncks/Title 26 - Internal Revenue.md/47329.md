###### ยง 1.1313(a)-3 Final disposition of claim for refund as a determination.
####### Items with respect to which the taxpayer's claim is allowed.

(b)(1) The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is sustained becomes final on the date of allowance of the refund or credit if:

(i) The taxpayer's claim for refund is unqualifiedly allowed; or

(ii) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained and with respect to other items is denied, so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit; or

(iii) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained, but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment and the items so applied do not completely offset such amount but merely reduce it so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit.

(2) If the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund with respect to an item is sustained but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment so that the net result is a disallowance of the claim for refund, the date of mailing, by registered mail, of the notice of disallowance (see section 6532) is the date of the final disposition as to the item with respect to which the taxpayer's contention is sustained.
