(2)If the total reduction required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is greater than the amount of the payment or set-aside made in respect of qualified indebtedness in a taxable year, then the portion of the reduction which is attributable to either section 545(c)(5)(A) or section 545(c)(5)(B), as the case may be, is that portion which bears the same ratio to the total reduction as the total reduction available under either section 545(c)(5)(A) or section 545(c)(5)(B), respectively, bears to the total reduction available under both such sections.
