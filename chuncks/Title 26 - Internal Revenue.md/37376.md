####### Analysis.,Example 2,3

(ii)All of Fund's assets, including the assets held by PRS that are treated as held proportionately by Fund under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, are held in a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. See paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (). The eligible fund that is composed of Fund is treated as established by Employer notwithstanding that Guarantor provides management services to PRS. See paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)() and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. All of the other requirements for qualified foreign pension fund status are satisfied by Fund as described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(B) through (F) of this section, and Fund is a qualified holder as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A. Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A because Guarantor is neither part of the organization or arrangement that forms Fund nor a qualified holder under paragraph (d) of this section that maintains qualified segregated accounts.
