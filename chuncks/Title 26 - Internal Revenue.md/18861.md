####### No double reduction.

(d)To the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, section 382 and this section shall not be applied to duplicate a reduction in the value of a loss corporation. Thus, for example, if the value of a loss corporation is reduced under section 382(l)(1) to reflect a capital contribution of stock of a component member, it is not again reduced by such amount under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If this paragraph (d) applies to prevent a reduction in value from being duplicated, the application of the other rules of this section, such as those relating to the restoration of value, is correspondingly limited in a manner consistent with the principles of this section.
