(ii)Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the interest payments from CFC1 to CFC3 must be offset by the amount of interest that CFC1 is considered as receiving indirectly from CFC3 and the interest payment from CFC3 to CFC2 is offset by the amount of the interest payment that CFC3 is considered as receiving indirectly from CFC2. The $10x payment by CFC1 to CFC3 is reduced by $5x, the amount of the interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 that is treated as being paid indirectly by CFC3 to CFC1. Similarly, the $20x interest payment from CFC3 to CFC2 is reduced by $5x, the amount of the interest payment from CFC1 to CFC3 that is treated as being paid indirectly by CFC2 to CFC3. Therefore, under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, CFC2 is treated as having made no interest payment to CFC1, CFC1 is treated as having paid $5x of interest to CFC3, and CFC3 is treated as having paid $15x to CFC2.
