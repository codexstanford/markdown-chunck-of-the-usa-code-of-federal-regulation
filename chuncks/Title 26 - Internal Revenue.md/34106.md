###### ยง 1.857-2 Real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain.
####### Net income or loss from prohibited transactions.

(8)An amount equal to the amount of any net income derived from prohibited transactions (as defined in section 857(b)(6)(B)(i)) is excluded. On the other hand, an amount equal to amount of any net loss derived from prohibited transactions (as defined in section 857(b)(6)(B)(ii)) is included. Because the amount of the net loss derived from prohibited transactions is taken into account in computing taxable income before the adjustments required by section 857(b)(2) and this section are made, the effect of including an amount equal to the amount of the loss is to disallow a deduction for the loss.
