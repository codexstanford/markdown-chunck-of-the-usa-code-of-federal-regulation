###### ยง 1.451-3 Timing of income inclusion for taxpayers with an applicable financial statement using an accrual method of accounting.
####### Taxable year 2021.

(B)Under the all events test in ยง 1.451-1(a), D is required to include $25x in gross income in 2021 as $25x is due under the terms of the contract and received by D during 2021. D does not have a fixed right to receive any portion of the remaining $75 as such amount is not due under the terms of the contract until future years and is also contingent on D's completion of the nonseverable services. Under the AFS income inclusion rule, because D has an enforceable right to recover all $50x reported as AFS revenue for 2021 if the customer were to terminate the contract on the last day of such year, all $50x is treated as "taken into account as AFS revenue" in 2021. Accordingly, D is required to include $50x in gross income in 2021.
