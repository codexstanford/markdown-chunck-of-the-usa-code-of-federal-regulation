####### Treatment of special basis vintage accounts.,a

(vi)A "special basis vintage account" is a vintage account for an amount of property improvement determined under subparagraph (2) (vii)() of this paragraph.

The election to allocate basis in accordance with this subdivision shall be made on the tax return filed for the taxable year. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:
