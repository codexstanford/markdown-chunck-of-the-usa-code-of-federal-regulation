####### Limitation on the amount of investment tax credit,Denial of investment tax credit when business use percentage not greater than 50 percent.

(b)-(1)Listed property is not treated as section 38 property to any extent unless the business use percentage (as defined in section 280F(d)(6) and ยง 1.280F-6(d)(1)) is greater than 50 percent. For example, if a taxpayer uses listed property in a trade or business in the taxable year in which it is placed in service, but the business use percentage is not greater than 50 percent, no investment tax credit is allowed for that listed property. If, in the taxable year in which listed property is placed in service, the only business/investment use (as defined in ยง 1.280F-6(d)(3)) of that property is qualified business use (as defined in ยง 1.280F-6(d)(2)(i)), and the business use percentage is 55 percent, the investment tax credit is allowed for the 55 percent of the listed property that is treated as section 38 property. The credit allowed is unaffected by any increase in the business use percentage in a subsequent taxable year.
