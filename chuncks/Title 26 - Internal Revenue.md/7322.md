(vii)The grandfathered amount under a plan or arrangement applies solely to the amounts paid under that plan or arrangement, so that regardless of whether all of the grandfathered amount is paid to the participant (for example, regardless of whether some or all of the grandfathered amount under the plan is forfeited under the terms of the plan), no portion of that grandfathered amount may be treated as a grandfathered amount under any other separate plan or arrangement in which the employee is a participant.
