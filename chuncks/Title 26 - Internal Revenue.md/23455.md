###### ยง 1.430(h)(3)-2 Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
####### Exception for submission between 1 and 2 years before effective date of table.

(B)If the plan sponsor submits a request for approval to use of substitute mortality tables more than 1 year (and less than 2 years) before the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables are to apply, then the experience study is not treated as failing to satisfy the rule in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if the last day of the final year reflected in the experience data is less than 2 years before the date of submission. For example, if an application for approval to use of substitute mortality tables that would apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2019 year is submitted in 2017, then an experience study using calendar year data may be based on data collected for a period that ends as early as December 31, 2015.
