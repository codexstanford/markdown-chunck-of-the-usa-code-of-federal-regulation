####### Acquiring the savings of the public.

(2)The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. In addition, such requirement will be considered to be met if more than 85 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits and withdrawable shares of the association are held during the taxable year by the general public as opposed to amounts deposited by family or related business groups or persons who are officers or directors of the association. The percentage specified in this subparagraph shall be computed as of the close of the taxable year, or at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the amounts of deposits held during the year. Such average shall be determined by computing the percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained.
