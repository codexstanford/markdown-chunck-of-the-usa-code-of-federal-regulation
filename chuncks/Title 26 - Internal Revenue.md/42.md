(b)Section 144 (a) and the regulations thereunder provide rules for treating an election to pay the tax under section 3 as an election to take the standard deduction, and for treating an election to take the standard deduction as an election to pay the tax under section 3. For example, if the taxpayer's return shows $5,000 or more of adjusted gross income and he elects to take the standard deduction, he will be deemed to have elected to pay the tax under section 3 if it is subsequently determined that his correct adjusted gross income is less than $5,000.
