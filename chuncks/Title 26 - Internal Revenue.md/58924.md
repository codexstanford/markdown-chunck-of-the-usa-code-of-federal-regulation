####### Adjustment upon the resolution of a contingent payment.

(ii)To the extent that interest has accrued under section 7872 on a split-dollar loan and the interest would not have accrued under this paragraph (j) in the absence of section 7872, the lender is not required to recognize income under ยง 1.1275-4(b) for a positive adjustment and the borrower is not treated as having interest expense for a positive adjustment.

This reversal is taken into account in determining adjusted gross income.
