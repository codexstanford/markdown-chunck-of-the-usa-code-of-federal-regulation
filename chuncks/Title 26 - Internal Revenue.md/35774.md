()To determine foreign source inventory gain or loss described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property is multiplied by PRS's foreign source inventory ratio. PRS's foreign source inventory ratio is PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property within PRS's three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, over PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during the same period. Thus, based on PRS's sales records from the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory gain for PRS's inventory is $4x (the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio of $12x over $30x).
