####### Successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation,In general.

(d)-(1)If a loss corporation has two (or more) ownership changes, any losses or section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards ((within the meaning of ยง 1.382-2(a)(7)) attributable to the period preceding the earlier ownership change are treated as pre-change losses with respect to both ownership changes. Thus, the later ownership change may result in a lesser (but never in a greater) section 382 limitation with respect to such pre-change losses. In any case, the amount of taxable income for any post-change year that can be offset by pre-change losses may not exceed the section 382 limitation for such ownership change, reduced by the amount of taxable income offset by pre-change losses subject to any earlier ownership change(s).
