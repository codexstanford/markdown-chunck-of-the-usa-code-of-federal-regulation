####### Application of the business-activities test,In general.,a,b,c,d

(3)-(i)For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the business-activities test shall ordinarily apply in making a determination with respect to income, gain, or loss which, even though generally of the passive type, arises directly from the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business in the United States. The business-activities test is of primary significance, for example, where () dividends or interest are derived by a dealer in stocks or securities, () gain or loss is derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets in the active conduct of a trade or business by an investment company, () royalties are derived in the active conduct of a business consisting of the licensing of patents or similar intangible property, or () service fees are derived in the active conduct of a servicing business. In applying the business-activities test, activities relating to the management of investment portfolios shall not be treated as activities of the trade or business conducted in the United States unless the maintenance of the investments constitutes the principal activity of that trade or business. See also subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for rules applicable to taxpayers conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.
