####### Elective method; tax adjustment measured by prior benefits.

(b)(1) If the taxpayer elects pursuant to section 1335 and in accordance with the provisions of ยง 1.1335-1 to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovers any money or property in respect of war loss property, the amount of the recovery in respect of such property for any taxable year shall not be included in income until the taxpayer has recovered an amount equal to his allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property, whether or not such allowable deductions resulted in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. However, for the purposes of section 6012(a)(1), relating to the requirement of individual returns, section 6012(a)(2), relating to the requirement of corporation returns, and section 1312, relating to the mitigation of the effect of the statute of limitations, the entire amount of the recovery shall be deemed to be an item includible in gross income for the taxable year in which the recovery is made. In lieu of including such amount in gross income, there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year of the recovery an adjustment on account of any tax benefits in all prior taxable years resulting directly or indirectly from the fact that the loss from the destruction or seizure of such property was an allowable deduction. The amount of such adjustment shall be the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing such allowable deductions with respect to the destruction or seizure of such property by an amount equal to that portion of the amount of the recovery which is not included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery. The portion of the amount of the recovery which is in excess of such allowable deductions is included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and is recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033. See section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. Such gain, if recognized, is included in gross income as ordinary income unless section 1231(a) applies to cause such gain to be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than six months. See section 1231(a) and the regulations thereunder.

(2) The determination as to whether and to what extent the amount of the recovery is to be excluded from gross income is to be made upon the basis of the total amount of the recoveries in each taxable year in respect of the same war loss property, as follows:

(i) The amount of the recovery in any taxable year is excluded from the gross income of such year and is not considered gain on an involuntary conversion to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property (whether or not such deductions resulted in a reduction of a tax of the taxpayer) reduced by the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property.

(ii) The amount of the recovery in any taxable year which is not excluded from gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is included in gross income and is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. The following provisions apply to this gain:
