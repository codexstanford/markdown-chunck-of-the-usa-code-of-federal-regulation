####### Analysis.

(B)Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. However, under the de minimis exception under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, 100 percent of the fair market rental value of the building is leased to a party under common control that has made an election to be an electing real property trade or business. Accordingly, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for its entire trade or business.
