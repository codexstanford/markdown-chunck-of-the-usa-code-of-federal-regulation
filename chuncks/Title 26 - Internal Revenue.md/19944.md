###### ยง 1.401(a)(4)-7 Imputation of permitted disparity.
####### Adjusting allocation rates,In general.

(b)-(1)The rules in this paragraph (b) produce an adjusted allocation rate for each employee by determining the excess contribution percentage under the hypothetical formula that would yield the allocation actually received by the employee, if the plan took into account the full disparity permitted under section 401(l)(2) and used the taxable wage base as the integration level. This adjusted allocation rate is used to determine whether the amount of contributions under the plan satisfies the general test of ยง 1.401(a)(4)-2(c) and to apply the average benefit percentage test on the basis of contributions under ยง 1.410(b)-5(d). Paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section apply to employees whose plan year compensation does not exceed and does exceed, respectively, the taxable wage base, and paragraph (b)(4) of this section provides definitions.
