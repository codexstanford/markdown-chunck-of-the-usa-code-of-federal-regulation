####### Impact of intercompany transactions,Impact on qualified business asset investment determination,In general.

(c)-(1)-(i)For purposes of determining a member's QBAI, the basis of specified tangible property does not include an amount equal to any gain or loss recognized with respect to such property by another member in an intercompany transaction (as defined in ยง 1.1502-13(b)(1)) until the time that such gain or loss is no longer deferred under ยง 1.1502-13. Thus, for example, if a selling member owns specified tangible property with an adjusted basis (within the meaning of section 1011) of $60x and an adjusted basis (for purposes of calculating QBAI) of $80x, and sells it for $50x to the purchasing member (and the intercompany loss remains deferred), the basis of such property for purposes of computing the purchasing member's QBAI is $80x.
