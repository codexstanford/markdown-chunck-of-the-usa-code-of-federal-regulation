() Immediately after the transaction, assets of DC1's Business A section 987 QBU are reflected on the books and records of DC1's Business A section 987 QBU and DC2's Business A section 987 QBU, each of which is a successor QBU with respect to DC1's Business A section 987 QBU within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Accordingly, DC1's Business A section 987 QBU is a deferral QBU within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and DC1 is a deferral QBU owner within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, DC1 includes in taxable income section 987 gain or loss with respect to Business A in connection with the deferral event to the extent provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c) of this section.

(D) Under paragraph (b) of this section, in the taxable year of the Entity A sale, DC1 includes in taxable income section 987 gain or loss with respect to Business A as determined under ยง 1.987-5, except that, for purposes of applying ยง 1.987-5, all assets and liabilities of Business A that, immediately after the Entity A sale, are reflected on the books and records of successor QBUs are treated as though they were not transferred and therefore as remaining on the books and records of DC1's Business A section 987 QBU notwithstanding the Entity A sale. Accordingly, DC1's remittance amount under ยง 1.987-5 is $0, and DC1 recognizes no section 987 gain or loss with respect to Business A.
