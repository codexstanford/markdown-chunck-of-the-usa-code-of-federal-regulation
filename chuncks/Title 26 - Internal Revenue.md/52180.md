###### ยง 1.1502-13 Intercompany transactions.
####### Example (14): Source of income under section 863,1,Intercompany sale,i,Facts.

(N)-()-()S manufactures inventory property solely in the United States and recognizes $75x of income on sales to B in Year 1. B conducts further production activity on the inventory property solely in Country Y and then sells the inventory property to X in Country Y and recognizes $25x of income on the sale to X, also in Year 1. Title passes from S to B, and from B to X, in Country Y. Assume that applying ยง 1.863-3 on a single entity basis, including the formula for apportionment of multi-country production activities by reference to the basis of production assets, $10x would be treated as foreign source income and $90x would be treated as U.S. source income (that is, 10 percent of the production occurred outside the United States and 90 percent occurred within the United States, as measured by the basis of assets used in production activities with respect to the property). Assume further that, on a separate entity basis, S would have $0x of foreign source income and $75x of U.S. source income and all of B's $25x of income would be foreign source income.
