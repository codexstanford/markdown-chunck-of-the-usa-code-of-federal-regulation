####### Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards; floor plan financing interest expense.

(4)Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (which were treated as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business in a prior taxable year) are not re-allocated between non-excepted and excepted trades or businesses in a succeeding taxable year. Instead, the carryforwards continue to be treated as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Floor plan financing interest expense also is not subject to allocation between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses (see ยง 1.163(j)-1(b)(19)) and is always treated as allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses.
