(B)If other transfers exist with respect to which GST exemption could be allocated under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A)() () and (), any GST exemption allocated under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A)()() of this section is allocated in an amount equal to the value of the transferred property as reported on the Form 709. Thus, if the GST exemption allocated on the Form 709 exceeds the value of the transfers reported on that return that have generation-skipping potential, the initial allocation under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A)()() of this section is in the amount of the value of those transfers as reported on that return. Any remaining amount of GST exemption allocated on that return is then allocated pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A)() () and () of this section, notwithstanding any subsequent upward adjustment in value of the transfers reported on the return.
