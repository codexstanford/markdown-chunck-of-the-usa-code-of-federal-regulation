###### ยง 1.1474-1 Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting.
####### Payments made by withholding agents to certain entities that are not recipients,Entities that provide information for a withholding agent to perform specific payee reporting.

(ii)-(A)If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a flow-through entity that is a passive NFFE, a nonparticipating FFI receiving a payment on behalf of an exempt beneficial owner, or a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient that is a partner, beneficiary, owner, or account holder of such entity to the extent the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation (under the rules of ยง 1.1471-3(c) and (d)) provided by such entity, as applicable, with respect to each such recipient. If a payment is made through tiers of such entities, the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the recipient to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with documentation provided with respect to that recipient. A withholding agent that is completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient described in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) must include on the form the information described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section for the entity through which the recipient directly receives the payment.
