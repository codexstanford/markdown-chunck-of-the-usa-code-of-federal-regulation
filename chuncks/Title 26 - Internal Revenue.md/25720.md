####### No specific allocation.

(B)If a rental agreement does not provide a specific allocation of fixed rent (for example, because the total amount of fixed rent specified is not equal to the total amount of fixed rent payable under the lease), the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental period is the amount of fixed rent payable during that rental period. If an amount of fixed rent is payable before the beginning of the lease term, it is allocated to the first rental period in the lease term. If an amount of fixed rent is payable after the end of the lease term, it is allocated to the last rental period in the lease term.
