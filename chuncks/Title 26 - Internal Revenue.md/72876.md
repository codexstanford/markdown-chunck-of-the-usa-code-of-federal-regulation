######## IRS determination that partnership representative designation not in effect.

(2)The IRS may, but is not required to, determine that a partnership representative designation is not in effect. The IRS is not obligated to search for or otherwise seek out information related to the circumstances in which the IRS may determine a partnership representative designation is not in effect, and the fact that the IRS is aware of any such circumstances does not obligate the IRS to determine that a partnership representative designation is not in effect. The IRS may determine that the partnership representative designation is not in effect if the IRS determines that-

(i) The partnership representative or the designated individual does not have substantial presence as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(ii) The partnership failed to appoint a designated individual as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as applicable;

(iii) The partnership failed to make a valid designation as described in paragraph (c) of this section;

(iv) The partnership representative or designated individual resigns as described in paragraph (d) of this section;

(v) The partnership has made multiple revocations as described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section; or

(vi) The partnership representative designation is no longer in effect as described in other published guidance.
