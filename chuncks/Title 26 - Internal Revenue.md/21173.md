###### ยง 1.410(b)-6 Excludable employees.
####### Collectively bargained employees,General rule.

(d)-(1)A collectively bargained employee is an excludable employee with respect to a plan that benefits solely noncollectively bargained employees. If a plan (within the meaning of ยง 1.410(b)-7(b)) benefits both collectively bargained employees and noncollectively bargained employees for a plan year, ยง 1.410(b)-7(c)(4) provides that the portion of the plan that benefits the collectively bargained employees is treated as a separate plan from the portion of the plan that benefits the noncollectively bargained employees. Thus, a collectively bargained employee is always an excludable employee with respect to the mandatorily disaggregated portion of any plan that benefits noncollectively bargained employees.
