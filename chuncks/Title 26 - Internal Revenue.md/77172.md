###### Taxation of Nonresident Aliens Who Are Residents of Denmark and of Danish Corporations
####### ยง 521.105 Scope of convention with respect to determination of "industrial or commercial profits".
######## United States permanent establishment.

(c)A nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary and partnership), who is a resident of Denmark, or a Danish corporation, whether or not carrying on a Danish enterprise, having a permanent establishment in the United States, is subject to tax upon industrial or commercial profits from sources within the United States to the same extent as are nonresident aliens and foreign corporations engaged in trade or business therein. In the determination of the income taxable to such alien or foreign corporation all industrial and commercial profits from sources within the United States shall be deemed to be allocable to the permanent establishment in the United States. Hence, for example, if a Danish enterprise having a permanent establishment in the United States sells in the United States, through a commission agent therein goods produced in Denmark, the resulting profits derived from United States sources from such transactions are allocable to such permanent establishment even though such transactions were carried on independently of such establishment. In determining industrial and commercial profits no account shall be taken of the mere purchase of merchandise within the United States by the Danish enterprise. The industrial or commercial profits of the permanent establishment shall be determined as if the establishment were an independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities and dealing at arm's length with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
