()A principal purpose of A entering into the transactions was to increase the amount of business interest income received by A; in effect, A increased its business interest income by separately accounting for its net deduction of $5x per year on the FX Swap. A's functional currency is the U.S. dollar and A conducts virtually all of its business in the U.S. dollar. A has no connection to Argentina or the Argentine peso and would not have entered into the transactions in the ordinary course of A's trade or business. The FX Swap was incurred by A as a part of a transaction that A entered into with a principal purpose of artificially increasing its business interest income. As a result, under paragraph (b)(22)(iv)(B) of this section, for purposes of section 163(j), the $10x business interest income earned on the Note by A is reduced by $5x (the net $5x paid by A on the FX Swap).
