###### § 1.1502-13 Intercompany transactions.
####### Treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are excluded or nondeductible,In general.

(6)-(i)Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, S's intercompany item might be redetermined to be excluded from gross income or treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. For example, S's intercompany loss from the sale of property to B is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount if B distributes the property to a nonmember shareholder at no further gain or loss (because, if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the loss would not have been recognized under section 311(a)). Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, however, provides limitations on the application of this rule to intercompany income or gain. See also §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 (adjustments to S's stock basis and earnings and profits to reflect amounts so treated).
