####### Effective date.

(e)(1) This section and section 503(f) are effective for taxable years ending after September 2, 1958, but only with respect to periods after such date. Thus, if a loan was made on or before September 2, 1958, without the receipt of adequate security and if, when such loan was made, it met all of the requirements of section 503(f) and this section, then the loan is not subject to section 503(b)(1) after September 2, 1958, and would not consitite a prohibited transaction after that date because of a lack of adequate security.

(2) See paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.503(b)-1 for the effective dates for application of the definition of adequate security.
