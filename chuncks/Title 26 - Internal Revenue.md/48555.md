####### Conversions of QSSTs and ESBTs.

(iii)With regard to conversions of QSSTs and ESBTs, see paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(B) and (C) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, if a qualifying investment is held by a QSST that converts to an ESBT, the beneficiary of the QSST is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT that then holds the qualifying investment, and the deemed owner is not a nonresident alien for purposes of this section (and thus notwithstanding ยง 1.1361-1(j)(8)), there has been no change in the grantor trust status because the deemed owner continues to be taxable under subtitle A of the Code on the income and gain from the qualifying investment.
