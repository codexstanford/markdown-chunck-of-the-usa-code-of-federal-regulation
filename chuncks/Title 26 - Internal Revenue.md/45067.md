Losses upon the complete or partial destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property are treated as losses upon an involuntary conversion whether or not there is a conversion of the property into other property or money and whether or not the property is uninsured, partially insured, or totally insured.

For certain exceptions to this subparagraph, see subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph.
