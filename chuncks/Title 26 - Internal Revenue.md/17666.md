####### Result.

(B)The distribution of the TFD stock by TFC in year 4 is a triggering event under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The distribution does not terminate the gain recognition agreement under paragraph (o)(5) of this section because after the distribution, the basis of the TFD stock in the hands of UST ($120x) is greater than the basis of the TFD stock at the time of the initial transfer ($80x). However, if UST reduces the basis of the TFD stock to $80x (as provided under paragraph (o)(5)(iii) of this section) the gain recognition agreement will terminate without further effect. If UST does not elect to reduce the basis of the TFD stock, see paragraph (k)(14) of this section.
