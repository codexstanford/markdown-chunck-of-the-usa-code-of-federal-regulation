####### Example 3. GRA not completed in all material respects,Facts.

(iii)-(A)DC timely filed its tax return for the year of the FS Transfer, reporting no gain with respect to the exchange of the FS stock. DC was aware of the requirement to file a GRA to avoid recognizing gain under section 367(a)(1), including the requirement to provide the basis and fair market value of the transferred stock. However, DC filed a purported GRA that did not contain the fair market value of the FS stock. Instead, the GRA was filed with the statement that the fair market value information was "available upon request." Other than the omission of the fair market value of the FS stock, the GRA contained all other information required by this section.
