####### Analysis.

(B)Since the software maintenance contract and the customer support agreement are two separate performance obligations, each yielding a separate item of gross income, paragraph (c)(8) of this section requires P to allocate the $100 payment to each item of gross income in the same manner as the payment is allocated to each performance obligation in P's AFS. For Federal income tax purposes, P must include $30 in gross income for 2021 ($20 allocable to the software maintenance contract and $10 allocable to the customer support agreement) and the remaining $70 is included in gross income for 2022.
