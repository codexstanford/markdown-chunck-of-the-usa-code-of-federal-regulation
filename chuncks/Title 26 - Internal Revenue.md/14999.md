(f)The provisions of section 270 and this section apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970. Thus, for instance, if the taxpayer had a profit of $2,000 attributable to a trade or business in 1965, section 270 and this section would not apply to the taxable years 1966 through 1970, even though he had losses of more than $50,000 in each of the 5 years ending with 1970. For provisions relating to activities not engaged in for profit applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, see section 183 and the regulations thereunder.
