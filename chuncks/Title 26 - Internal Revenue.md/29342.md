(b)The rules of section 271(b)(2) apply in determining whether the transfer of money or other property constitutes a contribution. Generally, money or other property, whether solicited personally, by mail, or through advertising, qualifies as a contribution. In addition, to the extent a political organization receives Federal, State, or local funds under the $1provision (sections 9001-9013), or any other provision for financing of campaigns, such amounts are to be treated as contributions.
