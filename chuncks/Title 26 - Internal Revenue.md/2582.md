####### Married individuals.

(e)If a separate return is filed by a husband or wife, the limitation based on amount of tax under paragraph (b) of this section shall be computed by substituting a $12,500 amount for the $25,000 amount in applying such paragraph (b). However, this reduction of the $25,000 amount to $12,500 applies only if the taxpayer's spouse is entitled to a credit under section 40 for the taxable year of such spouse which ends with, or within, the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer's spouse is entitled to a credit under section 40 either because of incurring WIN expenses for such taxable year of the spouse (whether directly incurred by such spouse or whether apportioned to such spouse, for example, from an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371(b)), or because of a credit carryback or carryover to such taxable year under ยง 1.50A-2. The determination of whether an individual is married shall be made under the principles of section 143 and the regulations thereunder.
